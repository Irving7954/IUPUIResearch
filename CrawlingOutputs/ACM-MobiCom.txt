Improving TCP/IP performance over wireless networks
Proceedings of the 1st annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
1995
TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well intraditional networks made up of links with low bit-error rates.Networks with higher bit-error rates, such as those with wirelesslinks and mobile hosts, violate many of the assumptions made byTCP, causing degraded end-to-end performance. In tbis paper, wedescribe the design and implementation of a simple protocol, calledthe snoop protocol, that improves TCP performance in wirelessnetworks. The protocol modifies network-layer software mainly at abase station and preserves end-to-end TCP semantics. The main ideaof the protocol is to cache packets at the base station and performlocal retransmissions across the wireless link. We have implementedthe snoop protocol on a wireless testbed consisting of IBM ThinkPadlaptops and i486 base stations communicating over an AT&amp;TWavelan. Our experiments show that it is significantly more robustat dealing with unreliable wireless links as compared to normalTCP; we have achieved throughput speedups of up to 20 times overregular TCP in our experiments with the protocol.

Analysis of a local-area wireless network
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
To understand better how users take advantage of wireless networks, we examine a twelve-week trace of a building-wide local-area wireless network. We analyze the network for overall user behavior (when and how intensively people use the network and how much they move around), overall network traffic and load characteristics (observed throughput and symmetry of incoming and outgoing traffic), and traffic characteristics from a user point of view (observed mix of applications and number of hosts connected to by users).Amongst other results, we find that users are divided into distinct location-based sub-communities, each with its own movement, activity, and usage characteristics. Most users exploit the network for web-surfing, session-oriented activities and chat-oriented activities. The high number of chat-oriented activities shows that many users take advantage of the mobile network for synchronous communication with others. In addition to these user-specific results, we find that peak throughput is usually caused by a single user and application. Also, while incoming traffic dominates outgoing traffic overall, the opposite tends to be true during periods of peak throughput, implying that significant asymmetry in network capacity could be undesirable for our users.While these results are only valid for this local-area wireless network and user community, we believe that similar environments may exhibit similar behavior and trends. We hope that our observations will contribute to a growing understanding of mobile user behavior.

The cricket compass for context-aware mobile applications
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
The ability to determine the orientation of a device is of fundamental importance in context aware and location-dependent mobile computing. By analogy to a traditional compass, knowledge of orientation through the Cricket compass attached to a mobile device enhances various applications, including efficient way-finding and navigation, directional service discovery, and "augmented-reality" displays. Our compass infrastructure enhances the spatial inference capability of the Cric ketindoor location system [20], and enables new pervasive computing applications.Using fixed active beacons and carefully placed passive ultrasonic sensors, we show how to estimate the orientation of a mobile device to within a few degrees, using precise, sub-centimeter differences in distance estimates from a beacon to each sensor on the compass. Then, given a set of fixed, active position beacons whose locations are known, we describe an algorithm that combines several carrier arrival times to produce a robust estimate of the rigid orientation of the mobile compass.The hardware of the Cricket compass is small enough to be integrated with a handheld mobile device. It includes five passive ultrasonic receivers, each 0.8cm in diameter, arrayed in a "V" shape a few centimeters across. Cricket beacons deployed throughout a building broadcast coupled 418MHz RF packet data and a 40KHz ultrasound carrier, which are processed by the compass software to obtain differential distance and position estimates. Our experimental results show that our prototype implementation can determine compass orientation to within 3 degrees when the true angle lies between &plusmn;30 degrees, and to within 5 degrees when the true angle lies between &plusmn;40 degrees, with respect to a fixed beacon.

Zero-interaction authentication
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
Laptops are vulnerable to theft, greatly increasing the likelihood of exposing sensitive files. Unfortunately, storing data in a cryptographic file system does not fully address this problem. Such systems ask the user to imbue them with long-term authority for decryption, but that authority can be used by anyone who physically possesses the machine. Forcing the user to frequently reestablish his identity is intrusive, encouraging him to disable encryption.Our solution to this problem is Zero-Interaction Authentication, or ZIA. In ZIA, a user wears a small authentication token that communicates with a laptop over a short-range, wireless link. Whenever the laptop needs decryption authority, it acquires it from the token; authority is retained only as long as necessary. With careful key management, ZIA imposes an overhead of only 9.3% for representative workloads. The largest file cache on our hardware can be re-encrypted within five seconds of the user's departure, and restored in just over six seconds after detecting the user's return. This secures the machine before an attacker can gain physical access, but recovers full performance before a returning user resumes work.

A receiver-centric transport protocol for mobile hosts with heterogeneous wireless interfaces
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
Numerous transport protocols have been proposed in related work for use by mobile hosts over wireless environments. A common theme among the design of such protocols is that they specifically address the distinct characteristics of the last-hop wireless link, such as random wireless errors, round-trip time variations, blackouts, handoffs, etc. In this paper, we argue that due to the defining role played by the wireless link on a connection's performance, locating the intelligence of a transport protocol at the mobile host that is adjacent to the wireless link can result in distinct performance advantages. To this end, we present a receiver-centric transport protocol called RCP (Reception Control Protocol) that is a TCP clone in its general behavior, but allows for better congestion control, loss recovery, and power management mechanisms compared to sender-centric approaches. More importantly, in the context of recent trends where mobile hosts are increasingly being equipped with multiple interfaces providing access to heterogeneous wireless networks, we show that a receiver-centric protocol such as RCP can enable a powerful and comprehensive transport layer solution for such multi-homed hosts. Specifically, we describe how RCP can be used to provide: (i) a scalable solution to support interface specific congestion control for a single active connection; (ii) seamless server migration capability during handoffs; and (iii) effective bandwidth aggregation when receiving data through multiple interfaces, either from one server, or from multiple replicated servers. We use both packet level simulations, and real Internet experiments to evaluate the proposed protocol.

MobiDesk: mobile virtual desktop computing
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
We present MobiDesk, a mobile virtual desktop computing hosting infrastructure that leverages continued improvements in network speed, cost, and ubiquity to address the complexity, cost, and mobility limitations of today's personal computing infrastructure. MobiDesk transparently virtualizes a user's computing session by abstracting underlying system resources in three key areas: display, operating system, and network. It provides a thin virtualization layer that decouples a user's computing session from any particular end-user device, and moves all application logic to hosting providers. The virtualization layer decouples a user's computing session from the underlying operating system and server instance, enabling high-availability service by transparently migrating sessions from one server to another during server maintenance or upgrades. We have implemented a prototype in Linux that works with existing unmodified applications and operating system kernels. Our experimental results demonstrate that MobiDesk has very low virtualization overhead, can provide a full featured desktop experience including full-motion video support, and is able to migrate users' sessions efficiently and reliably for high-availability, while maintaining existing network connections.

A unified energy-efficient topology for unicast and broadcast
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
We propose a novel communication efficient topology control algorithm for each wireless node to select communication neighbors and adjust its transmission power, such that all nodes together self-form a topology that is energy efficient simultaneously for both unicast and broadcast communications. We prove that the proposed topology is planar, which guarantees packet delivery if a certain localized routing method is used; it is power efficient for unicast-- the energy needed to connect any pair of nodes is within a small constant factor of the minimum under a common power attenuation model; it is efficient for broadcast: the energy consumption for broadcasting data on top of it is asymptotically the best compared with structures constructed locally; it has a constant bounded logical degree, which will potentially reduce interference and signal contention. We further prove that the average physical degree of all nodes is bounded by a small constant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first communication-efficient distributed algorithm to achieve all these properties. Previously, only a centralized algorithm was reported in [3]. Moreover, by assuming that the ID and position of every node can be represented in O(log n) bits for a wireless network of n nodes, our method uses at most 13n messages, where each message is of O(log n) bits. We also show that this structure can be efficiently updated for dynamical network environment. Our theoretical results are corroborated in the simulations.

Mobile broadband evolution: from controversy to convergence
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Wireless personal communication has existed for about a quarter century. In the 1980's analog FDMA served a small mostly North American base of wireless telephony users. The 1990's witnessed the start of widespread worldwide digital telephony and limited data service, categorized as 2nd Generation, employing two conflicting technologies, TDMA and CDMA. The first decade of the new century brought full wireless data and Internet connectivity with two competing 3rd Generation CDMA implementations: CDMA2000 and WCDMA. For the second decade beginning in 2010, early indications point to convergence upon a single 4th Generation high speed data technology, OFDMA, generally referred to as Mobile WiMax for which a standard 802.16e has recently been adopted. After describing this historical evolution, we shall address the challenges and opportunities of both 3rd and 4th Generation Wireless Broadband service.

Scheduling algorithms for multi-carrier wireless data systems
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
We consider the problem of scheduling wireless data in systems such as 802.16 (WIMAX). Each scheduling decision involves constructing a frame of one or more time slots. Within each time slot multiple carriers must be assigned to users. The important aspect of our problem is that a scheduler knows the channel rates across all users and all carriers whenever a scheduling decision is made. Hence there is no need to treat each carrier in complete isolation. This gives a potential for enhancing performance by allocating multiple carriers simultaneously. We analyze this problem in a situation where finite queues are fed by a data arrival process. We generalize the well-known MaxWeight algorithm for the single-carrier setting to accommodate a number of natural optimization problems in the multi-carrier setting. We state the hardness of these problems and present simple algorithmic solutions with provable performance bounds. We also validate our algorithms via numerical examples.

Multi-hop mobile wireless network design: implicit cross-layer loss models and performance sensitivities
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
We describe new methods for multi-hop mobile wireless network design, so as to meet performance specifications. We introduce an implicitly defined approximate loss model that couples the physical, MAC and routing layers' effects. The model provides quantitative statistical relations between the loss parameters that are used to characterize multiuser interference and physical path conditions on the one hand and the traffic rates and types between origin-destination pairs on the other. The model considers effects of hidden nodes, node scheduling algorithms, MAC and PHY layer failures and unsuccessful packet transmission attempts at the MAC layer in arbitrary network topologies where multiple paths share nodes. We consider both contention-based as well as scheduling-based MAC protocols. The new methods are based on implicit loss network models developed using fixed point methods. We describe the application of Automatic Differentiation (AD) to these implicit performance models, and develop a methodology for sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization for wireless protocols. We also introduce new methods that utilize on-line feedback from the PHY layer to simplify the joint MAC and routing protocol design. We provide several examples, with realistic scenarios, that demonstrate the benefits of applying these new methods in an integrated manner. We close with current and future work that extends these methods and algorithms towards a Component-Based design, performance analysis and validation of distributed protocols for mobile wireless networks. We argue that this set of ideas provides a very promising approach to 'clean slate' design for such networks and the resulting hybrid broadband Internet.

Dynamic spectrum access in DTV whitespaces: design rules, architecture and algorithms
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
In November 2008, the FCC ruled that the digital TV whitespaces be used for unlicensed access. This is an exciting development because DTV whitespaces are in the low frequency range (50-698 MHz) compared to typical cellular and ISM bands, thus resulting in much better propagation characteristics and much higher spectral efficiencies. The FCC has also mandated certain guidelines for short range unlicensed access, so as to avoid any interference to DTV receivers. We consider the problem of WiFi like access (popularly referred to as WiFi 2.0) for enterprizes. We assume that the access points and client devices are equipped with cognitive radios, i.e., they can adaptively choose the center frequency, bandwidth and ower of operation. The access points can be equipped with one or more radios. Our goal is to design a complete system, which (i) does not violate the FCC mandate, (ii) dynamically assigns center frequency and bandwidth to each access point based on their demands and (iii) squeezes the maximum efficiency from the available spectrum. This problem is far more general than prior work that investigated dynamic spectrum allocation in cellular and ISM bands, due to the non-homogenous nature of the whitespaces, i.e., different whitespace widths in different parts of the spectrum and the large range of frequency bands with different propagation characteristics. This calls for a more holistic approach to system design that also accounts for frequency dependent propagation characteristics and radio frontend characteristics. In this paper, we first propose design rules for holistic system design. We then describe an architecture derived from our design rules. Finally we propose demand based dynamic spectrum allocation algorithms with provable worst case guarantees. We provide extensive simulation results showing that (i) the performance of our algorithm is within 94% of the optimal in typical settings and (ii) and the DTV whitespaces can provide significantly higher data rates compared to the 2.4GHz ISM band. Our approach is general enough for designing any system with access to a wide range of spectrum.

Achieving single channel, full duplex wireless communication
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
This paper discusses the design of a single channel full-duplex wireless transceiver. The design uses a combination of RF and baseband techniques to achieve full-duplexing with minimal effect on link reliability. Experiments on real nodes show the full-duplex prototype achieves median performance that is within 8% of an ideal full-duplexing system. This paper presents Antenna Cancellation, a novel technique for self-interference cancellation. In conjunction with existing RF interference cancellation and digital baseband interference cancellation, antenna cancellation achieves the amount of self-interference cancellation required for full-duplex operation. The paper also discusses potential MAC and network gains with full-duplexing. It suggests ways in which a full-duplex system can solve some important problems with existing wireless systems including hidden terminals, loss of throughput due to congestion, and large end-to-end delays.

FLUID: improving throughputs in enterprise wireless lans through flexible channelization
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
This paper introduces models and a system for designing 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs) using flexible channelization -- the choice of an appropriate channel width and center frequency for each transmission. In contrast to current 802.11 systems that use fixed width channels, the proposed system, FLUID, configures all access points and their clients using flexible channels. We show that a key challenge in designing such a system stems from managing the effects of interference due to multiple transmitters employing variable channel widths, in a network-wide setting. We implemented FLUID in an enterprise-like setup using a 50 node testbed (with off-the shelf wireless cards) and we show that FLUID improves the average throughput by 59% across all PHY rates, compared to existing fixed-width approaches.

Nanonetworks: a new frontier in communications
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Nanotechnology is enabling the development of devices in a scale ranging from one to a few one hundred nanometers. Nanonetworks, i.e., the interconnection of nano-scale devices, are expected to expand the capabilities of single nano-machines by allowing them to cooperate and share information. Traditional communication technologies are not directly suitable for nanonetworks mainly due to the size and power consumption of existing transmitters, receivers and additional processing components. All these define a new communication paradigm that demands novel solutions such as nano-transceivers, channel models for the nano-scale, and protocols and architectures for nanonetworks. In this talk, first the state-of-the-art in nano-machines, including architectural aspects, expected features of future nano-machines, and current developments are presented for a better understanding of the nanonetwork scenarios. Moreover, nanonetworks features and components are explained and compared with traditional communication networks. Novel nano-antennas based on nano-materials as well as the terahertz band are investigated for electromagnetic communication in nanonetworks. Furthermore, molecular communication mechanisms are presented for short-range networking based on ion signaling and molecular motors, for medium-range networking based on flagellated bacteria and nanorods, as well as for long-range networking based on pheromones and capillaries. Finally, open research challenges such as the development of network components, molecular communication theory, and new architectures and protocols, which need to be solved in order to pave the way for the development and deployment of nanonetworks within the next couple of decades are presented.

The evolution of mobility and wireless technologies in the age of the internet of things
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
This keynote presentation will focus on the challenges and opportunities imposed on mobility and wireless communications technologies by the emerging and explosive needs of the future Internet of Things. As traditional (wireless) networking meets the "real world", with its highly mobile requirements, its noisy and lossy environments, its need to optimize communications across multiple, non-homogeneous wireless technologies, with often intermittent connectivity, its requirements for more deterministic exchanges, the urgent need of innovation and accelerated research into a number of relevant and exiting domains become apparent. We will describe the ICT Infrastructure developments needed to support these new requirements, and identify broad open mobility and wireless research topics, which may help catalyze innovation affecting our industry. In particular, among other topics, we will deal with the issue of IP mobility, and will discuss technologies responding to these requirements (LISP among them). We will then consider the need to support and manage non-homogeneous, multi-homed, highly lossy wireless connectivity, and will highlight the potential roles of Distributed Computing and of Network Coding in this domain. Finally, we will detail the deterministic networking requirements arising in a number of Internet of Things verticals, and highlight progress towards the definition and standardization of techniques enabling more predictable exchanges even in wireless networks.

Wireless Power Hotspot that Charges All of Your Devices
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Each year, consumers carry an increasing number of gadgets on their person: mobile phones, tablets, smartwatches, etc. As a result, users must remember to recharge each device, every day. Wireless charging promises to free users from this burden, allowing devices to remain permanently unplugged. Today's wireless charging, however, is either limited to a single device, or is highly cumbersome, requiring the user to remove all of her wearable and handheld gadgets and place them on a charging pad. This paper introduces MultiSpot, a new wireless charging technology that can charge multiple devices, even as the user is wearing them or carrying them in her pocket. A MultiSpot charger acts as an access point for wireless power. When a user enters the vicinity of the MultiSpot charger, all of her gadgets start to charge automatically. We have prototyped MultiSpot and evaluated it using off-the-shelf mobile phones, smartwatches, and tablets. Our results show that MultiSpot can charge 6 devices at distances of up to 50cm.

Where the curb meets the cloud: urban innovation in the digital age
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Cities have benefited from the three greatest technological innovations of the past 200 years: the steam engine, electrification, and the automobile. But each advance has created its own challenges, including pollution, overcrowding, sprawl. As the digital revolution transforms cities once again, how can we make sure it improves quality of life while minimizing the downside? With population density comes the possibility of deploying network connectivity and wayfinding at lower cost, but density also increases complexity of deployment. How can digital technology reduce the bad friction of urban environments, such as congestion, cost, and complexity, while increasing good friction, such as all of the serendipitous interactions that cities encourage? Underlying all this change is ubiquitous connectivity and mobile technology, from the phones people carry with them to the supporting devices and network endpoints embedded in the urban infrastructure. Sidewalk Labs is an Alphabet company that works with cities to develop new technology that can improve urban life. We will discuss some of our discoveries and beliefs, and talk about our plans to use mobile technology to help cities take full advantage of the digital revolution.

Dynamic power management for portable systems
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
Portable systems require long battery lifetime while still delivering high performance. Dynamic power management (DPM) policies trade off the performance for the power consumption at the system level in portable devices. In this work we present the time-indexed SMDP model (TISMDP) that we use to derive optimal policy for DPM in portable systems. TISMDP model is needed to handle the non-exponential user request interarrival times we observed in practice. We use our policy to control power consumption on three different devices: the SmartBadge portable device [18], the Sony Vaio laptop hard disk and WLAN card. Simulation results show large savings for all three devices when using our algorithm. In addition, we measured the power consumption and performance of our algorithm and compared it with other DPM algorithms for laptop hard disk and WLAN card. The algorithm based on our TISMDP model has 1.7 times less power consumption as compared to the default Windows timeout policy for the hard disk and three times less power consumption as compared to the default algorithm for the WLAN card.

Experiences of developing and deploying a context-aware tourist guide: the GUIDE project
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2000
The GUIDE system has been developed to provide city visitors with a hand-held context-aware tourist guide. The system has been successfully deployed in a major tourist destination and is currently at the stage where it is publicly available to visitors who wish to explore the city. Reaching this stage has been the culmination of a number of distinct research efforts. In more detail, the development of GUIDE has involved: capturing a real set of application requirements, investigating the properties of a cell-based wireless communications technology in a built-up environment and deploying a network based on this technology around the city, designing and populating an information model to represent attractions and key buildings within the city, prototyping the development of a distributed application running across portable GUIDE units and stationary cell-servers and finally, evaluating the entire system during an extensive field-trial study. This paper reports on our results in each of these areas. We believe that through our work on the GUIDE project we have produced a blueprint for the development of interactive context-aware systems that should be of real value to those in the community who wish to develop such systems in a practical environment.

The Cricket location-support system
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of <italic>Cricket</italic>, a location-support system for in-building, mobile, location-dependent applications. It allows applications running on mobile and static nodes to learn their physical location by using <italic>listeners</italic> that hear and analyze information from <italic>beacons</italic> spread throughout the building. Cricket is the result of several design goals, including user privacy, decentralized administration, network heterogeneity, and low cost. Rather than explicitly tracking user location, Cricket helps devices learn where they are and lets them decide whom to advertise this information to; it does not rely on any centralized management or control and there is no explicit coordination between beacons; it provides information to devices regardless of their type of network connectivity; and each Cricket device is made from off-the-shelf components and costs less than U.S. $10. We describe the randomized algorithm used by beacons to transmit information, the use of concurrent radio and ultrasonic signals to infer distance, the listener inference algorithms to overcome multipath and interference, and practical beacon configuration and positioning techniques that improve accuracy. Our experience with Cricket shows that several location-dependent applications such as in-building active maps and device control can be developed with little effort or manual configuration.

Sending messages to mobile users in disconnected ad-hoc wireless networks
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
An ad-hoc network is formed by a group of mobile hosts upon a wireless network interface. Previous research in this area has concentrated on routing algorithms which are designed for fully connected networks. The usual way to deal with a disconnected ad-hoc network is to let the mobile computer wait for network reconnection passively, which may lead to unacceptable transmission delays. In this paper, we propose an approach that guarantees message transmission in minimal time. In this approach, mobile hosts actively modify their trajectories to transmit messages. We develop algorithms that minimize the trajectory modifications under two different assumptions: (a) the movements of all the nodes in the system are known and (b) the movements of the hosts in the system are not known.

Directed diffusion: a scalable and robust communication paradigm for sensor networks
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
Advances in processor, memory and radio technology will enable small and cheap nodes capable of sensing, communication and computation. Networks of such nodes can coordinate to perform distributed sensing of environmental phenomena. In this paper, we explore the <italic>directed diffusion</italic> paradigm for such coordination. Directed diffusion is datacentric in that all communication is for named data. All nodes in a directed diffusion-based network are application-aware. This enables diffusion to achieve energy savings by selecting empirically good paths and by caching and processing data in-network. We explore and evaluate the use of directed diffusion for a simple remote-surveillance sensor network.

Analysis of analytical mobility models with respect to the applicability for handover modeling and to the estimation of signaling cost
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
This paper analyzes two analytical mobility models for their suitability to handover modeling and to the estimation of signaling cost. Some insufficiencies of the often employed Hong/Rappaport model are detected. Here, an infinite mean dwell time occurs which is not suitable for performance evaluation of mobile communications systems. Therefore, handover modeling is not possible. To prevent infinite dwell times, an universal condition for the velocity distribution is derived. The biased sampling formula of the velocity distribution fulfills our universal condition. Finally, the consequences of the biased sampling of the velocity for the signaling traffic are discussed for the modified Hong/Rappaport model and a highway model. In contrast to the analytical calculations without consideration of biased sampling, we detect a significant increase of signaling traffic. It is shown that the probability density function of the velocity of the boundary-crossing subscribers is given by the biased sampling formula. Thus, for handover modeling and the exact estimation of signaling traffic the biased sampling formula of the velocity has to be taken into account in analytical calculations in any case.

A new model for packet scheduling in multihop wireless networks
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
The goal of packet scheduling disciplines is to achieve <italic>fair</italic> and <italic>maximum</italic> allocation of channel bandwidth. However, these two criteria can potentially be in conflict in a generic-topology multihop wireless network where a single logical channel is shared among multiple contending flows and spatial reuse of the channel bandwidth is possible. In this paper, we propose a new model for packet scheduling that addresses this conflict. The main results of this paper are the following: (a) a two-tier service model that provides a minimum "fair" allocation of the channel bandwidth for each packet flow and additionally maximizes spatial reuse of bandwidth, (b) an ideal centralized packet scheduling algorithm that realizes the above service model, and (c) a practical distributed backoff-based channel contention mechanism that approximates the ideal service within the framework of the CSMA/CA protocol.

Achieving MAC layer fairness in wireless packet networks
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
Link-layer fairness models that have been proposed for wireline and packet cellular networks cannot be generalized for shared channel wireless networks because of the unique characteristics of the wireless channel, such as location-dependent contention, inherent conflict between optimizing channel utilization and achieving fairness, and the absence of any centralized control.In this paper, we propose a <italic>general analytical framework that captures the unique characteristics of shared wireless channels</italic> and allows the modeling of a large class of system-wide fairness models via the specification of per-flow utility functions. We show that system-wide fairness can be achieved without explicit global coordination so long as each node executes a contention resolution algorithm that is designed to optimize its local utility function.We present a <italic>general mechanism for translating a given fairness model in our framework into a corresponding contention resolution algorithm</italic>. Using this translation, we derive the backoff algorithm for achieving <italic>proportional fairness</italic> in wireless shared channels, and compare the fairness properties of this algorithm with both the ideal proportional fairness objective, and state-of-the-art backoff-based contention resolution algorithms.We believe that the two aspects of the proposed framework, i.e. the ability to specify arbitrary fairness models via local utility functions, and the ability to automatically generate local contention resolution mechanisms in response to a given utility function, together provide the path for achieving flexible service differentiation in future shared channel wireless networks.

Intersystem location update and paging schemes for multitier wireless networks
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
Global wireless networks enable mobile users to communicate regardless of their locations. One of the most important issues is location management in a highly dynamic environment because mobile users may roam between different wireless networks, network operators, and geographical regions. In this paper, a location tracking mechanism is introduced, which consists of intersystem location updates using the concept of boundary location area (BLA) and paging using the concept of boundary location register (BLR). The BLA is determined by a dynamic location update policy in which the velocity and the quality of service (QoS) are taken into account on a per-user basis. The BLR is used to maintain the records of mobile users crossing the boundary of networks. This mechanism not only reduces location tracking costs but also significantly decreases call loss rates and average paging delays. The performance evaluation of the proposed schemes is provided to demonstrate their effectiveness in multitier wireless networks.

Tracking mobile users with uncertain parameters
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
A method of reducing the wireless cost of tracking mobile users with uncertain parameters is developed in this paper. Such uncertainty arises naturally in wireless networks, since an efficient user tracking is based on a <italic>prediction</italic> of its future call and mobility parameters. The conventional approach based on dynamic tracking is not reliable in the sense that inaccurate prediction of the user mobility parameters may significantly reduce the tracking efficiency. Unfortunately, such uncertainty is unavoidable for mobile users, especially for bursty mobility pattern.In this study we propose a novel approach, which is efficient yet reliable. The basic idea is to incorporate a distributed scheme with a centralized scheme. The location update process incorporates a topology-independent distance based strategy and a load-sensitive timer. This combination forms a mechanism that bounds from above the <italic>total</italic> tracking cost. The registration activity is governed by the system, such that it increases at lowly loaded cells and decreases at heavily loaded cells.The expected wireless cost of tracking under the proposed method is significantly reduced, in comparison to the existing methods currently used in cellular networks. Furthermore, as opposed to other tracking methods, the worst case tracking cost is bounded from above and governed by the system. The proposed strategy can be easily implemented, and it does not require a significant computational power from the user.

A scalable location service for geographic ad hoc routing
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
GLS is a new distributed location service which tracks mobile node locations. GLS combined with geographic forwarding allows the construction of ad hoc mobile networks that scale to a larger number of nodes than possible with previous work. GLS is decentralized and runs on the mobile nodes themselves, requiring no fixed infrastructure. Each mobile node periodically updates a small set of other nodes (its location servers) with its current location. A node sends its position updates to its location servers without knowing their actual identities, assisted by a predefined ordering of node identifiers and a predefined geographic hierarchy. Queries for a mobile node's location also use the predefined identifier ordering and spatial hierarchy to find a location server for that node.Experiments using the <italic>ns</italic> simulator for up to 600 mobile nodes show that the storage and bandwidth requirements of GLS grow slowly with the size of the network. Furthermore, GLS tolerates node failures well: each failure has only a limited effect and query performance degrades gracefully as nodes fail and restart. The query performance of GLS is also relatively insensitive to node speeds. Simple geographic forwarding combined with GLS compares favorably with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR): in larger networks (over 200 nodes) our approach delivers more packets, but consumes fewer network resources.

A unified header compression framework for low-bandwidth links
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
Compressing protocol headers has traditionally been an attractive way of conserving bandwidth over low-speed links, including those in wireless systems. However, despite the growth in recent years in the number of end-to-end protocols beyond TCP/IP, header compression deployment for those protocols has not kept pace. This is in large part due to complexities in implementation, which often requires a detailed knowledge of kernel internals, and a lack of a common way of pursuing the general problem across a variety of end-to-end protocols. To address this, rather than defining several new protocol-specific standards, we present a unified framework for header compression. This framework includes a simple, platform-independent header description language that protocol implementors can use to describe high-level header properties, and a platform-specific code generation tool that produces kernel source code automatically from this header specification. Together, the high-level description language and code generator free protocol designers from having to understand any details of the target platform, enabling them to implement header compression with relatively little effort. We analyze the performance of compression produced using this framework for TCP/IP in the Linux 2.0 kernel and demonstrate that unified, automatically-generated header compression without significant performance penalty is viable.

Reduced cell switching in a mobile computing environment

With the huge growth and the market for laptop and palmtop computer purchases, a rapid increase of mobile usage in the Internet is expected. As mobile nodes move in a wireless computer network, a mobile node must determine when to switch its link-level point of attachment to the wired network. In this paper, we present six cell switching techniques and discuss their attributes. Specifically, we present the Late, Early, and Strong cell switching techniques and three variations of them. We then investigate the performance of these six techniques to discover the best method a mobile node should use to determine when to perform its re-attachment to the wired network.

An end-to-end approach to host mobility
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
We present the design and implementation of an end-to-end architecture for Internet host mobility using dynamic updates to the Domain Name System (DNS) to track host location. Existing TCP connections are retained using secure and efficient connection migration, enabling established connections to seamlessly negotiate a change in endpoint IP addresses without the need for a third party. Our architecture is secure-name updates are effected via the secure DNS update protocol, while TCP connection migration uses a novel set of <italic>Migrate</italic> options-and provides a pure end-system alternative to routing-based approaches such as Mobile IP.Mobile IP was designed under the principle that fixed Internet hosts and applications were to remain unmodified and only the underlying IP substrate should change. Our architecture requires no changes to the unicast IP substrate, instead modifying transport protocols and applications at the end hosts. We argue that this is not a hindrance to deployment; rather, in a significant number of cases, it allows for an easier deployment path than Mobile IP, while simultaneously giving better performance. We compare and contrast the strengths of end-to-end and network-layer mobility schemes, and argue that end-to-end schemes are better suited to many common mobile applications. Our performance experiments show that hand-off times are governed by TCP migrate latencies, and are on the order of a round-trip time of the communicating peers.

Distributed fair scheduling in a wireless LAN
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2000
Fairness is an important issue when accessing a shared wireless channel. With <italic>fair scheduling</italic>, it is possible to allocate bandwidth in proportion to <italic>weights</italic>of the packet <italic>flows</italic> sharing the channel. This paper presents a fully <italic>distributed</italic> algorithm for fair scheduling in a wireless LAN. The algorithm can be implemented without using a centralized coordinator to arbitrate medium access. The proposed protocol is derived from the Distributed Coordination Function in the IEEE 802.11 standard. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to schedule transmission such that the bandwidth allocated to different flows is proportional to their weights. An attractive feature of the proposed approach is that it can be implemented with simple modifications to the IEEE 802.11 standard.

Downlink scheduling in CDMA data networks
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2000
Packet data is expected to dominate third generation wireless networks, unlike current generation voice networks. This opens up new and interesting problems. Physical and link layer issues have been studied extensively, while resource allocation and scheduling issues have not been addressed satisfactorily.In this work, we address resource management on the downlink of CDMA packet data networks. Network performance (for example, capacity) has been addressed, but user centric performance has not received much attention. Recently, various non-traditional scheduling schemes based on new metrics have been proposed, and target user performance (mostly without reference to wireless). We adapt these metrics to the CDMA context, and establish some new results for the offline scheduling problem. In addition, we modify a large class of online algorithms to work in our setup and conduct a wide range of experiments. Based on detailed simulations, we infer that:<list><item>Algorithms which exploit "request sizes" seem to outperform those that do not. Among these, algorithms that also exploit channel conditions provide significantly higher network throughput.</item><item>Depending on continuous or discretized bandwidth conditions, either pure time multiplexing or a combination of time and code multiplexing strikes an excellent balance between user satisfaction and network performance.</item><item>Discrete bandwidth conditions can lead to degraded user level performance without much impact on network performance. We argue that the discretization needs to be fine tuned to address this shortcoming.</item></list>

Adaptive allocation of CDMA resources for network-level QoS assurances
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
In a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network, multiple mobile hosts (MHs) can simultaneously transmit over the wireless channel by using different codes. To assure an acceptable quality of service for all users' flows, the network usually tunes the transmit powers of all MHs to achieve a certain level of signal strength as compared to the noise and the interference (SINR) for each user. The traditional assumption in power control schemes is that the SINR requirement is statically determined for each user flow.In contrast, in this paper, we propose a scheme that dynamically adapts the SINR requirements of user flows based on its quality of service (QoS) requirements and the conditions of the wireless channel between the MHs and the base station. As a result of this adaptation, we show that network-level QoS measures such as fraction of packets meeting their delay requirements and energy consumed per packet transmission are significantly better than in a scheme that statically fixes the SINR requirements.Our scheme uses a simple table-driven approach for optimally selecting the target SINR requirement for each MH at run time. The entries in the table are computed offline using a dynamic programming algorithm with the objective of maximizing a profit function that balances the need for meeting the network-level QoS requirements and the cost of using a particular target SINR for a given transmission.

A scalable low-latency cache invalidation strategy for mobile environments
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
Caching frequently accessed data items on the client side is an effective technique to improve performance in a mobile environment. Classical cache invalidation strategies are not suitable for mobile environments due to the disconnection and mobility of the mobile clients. One attractive cache invalidation technique is based on invalidation reports (IRs). However, the IR-based cache invalidation solution has two major drawbacks, which have not been addressed is previous research. First, there is a long query latency associated with this solution since a client cannot answer the query until the next IR interval. Second, when the server updates a hot data item, all clients have to query the server and get the data from the server separately, which wastes a large amount of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an IR-based cache invalidation algorithm which can significantly reduce the query latency and efficiently utilize the broadcast bandwidth. Detailed simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed methodology. Compared to previous IR-based schemes, our scheme can significantly improve the throughput and reduce the query latency, the number of uplink request, and the broadcast bandwidth requirements.

Using semantic caching to manage location dependent data in mobile computing
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2000
Location-dependent applications are becoming very popular in mobile environments. To improve system performance and facilitate disconnection, caching is crucial to such applications. In this paper, a semantic caching scheme is used to access location dependent data in mobile computing. We first develop a mobility model to represent the moving behaviors of mobile users and formally define location dependent queries. We then investigate query processing and cache management strategies. The performance of the semantic caching scheme and its replacement strategy FAR is evaluated through a simulation study. Our results show that semantic caching is more flexible and effective for use in LDD applications than page caching, whose performance is quite sensitive to the database physical organization. We also notice that the semantic cache replacement strategy FAR, which utilizes the semantic locality in terms of locations, performs robustly under different kinds of workloads.

Pushing dependent data in clients-providers-servers systems
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
In a satellite and wireless networks and in advanced traffic information systems in which the up-link bandwidth is very limited, a server broadcasts data files in a round-robin manner. The data files are provided by different providers and are accessed by many clients. The providers are independent and therefore files may share information. The clients who access these files may have different patterns of access. Some clients may wish to access more than one file at a time in any order, some clients may access one file out of of several files, and some clients may wish to access a second file only after accessing another file. The goal of the server is to order the files in a way that minimizes the access time of the clients given some a-priori knowledge of their access patterns. This paper introduces a <italic>clients-providers-servers</italic> model that represents certain environments better than the traditional clients-servers model. Then, we show that a random order of the data files performs well independent of the specific access pattern. Our main technical contribution is showing how to de-randomize the randomized algorithm that is based on selecting a random order. The resulting algorithm is a polynomial time deterministic algorithm that finds an order that achieves the bounds of the random order.

Caching strategies in on-demand routing protocols for wireless ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
An <italic>on-demand routing protocol</italic> for wireless and hoc networks is one that searches for and attempts to discover a route to some destination node only when a sending node originates a data packet addressed to that node. In order to avoid the need for such a route discovery to be performed before each data packet is sent, such routing protocols must cache routes previously discovered. This paper presents an analysis of the effects of different design choices for this caching in on-demand routing protocols in wireless ad hoc networks, dividing the problem into choices of cache <italic>structure</italic>, cache <italic>capacity</italic>, and cache <italic>timeout</italic>. Our analysis is based on the Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR), which operates entirely on-demand. Using detailed simulations of wireless ad hoc networks of 50 mobile nodes, we studied a large number of different caching algorithms that utilize a range of design choices, and simulated each cache primarily over a set of 50 different movement scenarios drawn from 5 different types of mobility models. We also define a set of new <italic>mobility metrics</italic> that allow accurate characterization of the relative difficulty that a given movement scenario presents to an ad hoc network routing protocol, and we analyze each mobility metric's ability to predict the actual difficulty in terms of routing overhead experienced by the routing protocol across the scenarios in our study.

GPSR: greedy perimeter stateless routing for wireless networks
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
We present Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR), a novel routing protocol for wireless datagram networks that uses the <italic>positions</italic> of routers and a packet's destination to make packet forwarding decisions. GPSR makes <italic>greedy</italic> forwarding decisions using only information about a router's immediate neighbors in the network topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedy forwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing around the <italic>perimeter</italic> of the region. By keeping state only about the local topology, GPSR scales better in per-router state than shortest-path and ad-hoc routing protocols as the number of network destinations increases. Under mobility's frequent topology changes, GPSR can use local topology information to find correct new routes quickly. We describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive simulation of mobile wireless networks to compare its performance with that of Dynamic Source Routing. Our simulations demonstrate GPSR's scalability on densely deployed wireless networks.

Mitigating routing misbehavior in mobile ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
This paper describes two techniques that improve throughput in an ad hoc network in the presence of nodes that agree to forward packets but fail to do so. To mitigate this problem, we propose categorizing nodes based upon their dynamically measured behavior. We use a <italic>watchdog</italic> that identifies misbehaving nodes and a <italic>pathrater</italic> that helps routing protocols avoid these nodes. Through simulation we evaluate watchdog and pathrater using packet throughput, percentage of overhead (routing) transmissions, and the accuracy of misbehaving node detection. When used together in a network with moderate mobility, the two techniques increase throughput by 17% in the presence of 40% misbehaving nodes, while increasing the percentage of overhead transmissions from the standard routing protocol's 9% to 17%. During extreme mobility, watchdog and pathrater can increase network throughput by 27%, while increasing the overhead transmissions from the standard routing protocol's 12% to 24%.

Challenges: an application model for pervasive computing
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
The way mobile computing devices and applications are developed, deployed and used today does not meet the expectations of the user community and falls far short of the potential for pervasive computing. This paper challenges the mobile computing community by questioning the roles of devices, applications, and a user's environment. A vision of pervasive computing is described, along with attributes of a new application model that supports this vision, and a set of challenges that must be met in order to bring the vision to reality.

Intrusion detection in wireless ad-hoc networks
Proceedings of the 6th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2000
As the recent denial-of-service attacks on several major Internet sites have shown us, no open computer network is immune from intrusions. The wireless ad-hoc network is particularly vulnerable due to its features of open medium, dynamic changing topology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management point, and lack of a clear line of defense. Many of the intrusion detection techniques developed on a fixed wired network are not applicable in this new environment. How to do it differently and effectively is a challenging research problem. In this paper, we first examine the vulnerabilities of a wireless ad-hoc network, the reason why we need intrusion detection, and the reason why the current methods cannot be applied directly. We then describe the new intrusion detection and response mechanisms that we are developing for wireless ad-hoc networks.

This paper describes an e-mail system for wearable computing environments. In this system, we extend the conventional mail format and the server/client(browser) architecture by considering the specific features of wearable computing environments, i.e., full time operation, hands-free use of computer, and close relationship to our daily life. A mail author can specify the behavior of his/her mail by embedding several useful commands in the mail. A user can specify in the mail various conditions as commands such as time, location of the recipient, and status of various sensors to allow an adaptive behavior in the mail. We also describe other features of the system to support user's wearable computing life.

<italic>We describe Environmental Observation and Forecasting Systems (EOFS), a new class of large-scale distributed system designed to monitor, model, and forecast wide-area physical processes such as river systems. EOFS have strong social relevance in areas such as education, transportation, agriculture, natural resource planning and disaster response. In addition, they represent an opportunity for scientists to study large physical systems to an extent that was not previously possible. Building the next generation of EOFS pose a number of difficult challenges in all aspects of wireless networking, including media protocols for long distance vertical communication through water, flooding algorithms in ad-hoc network topologies, support for rate- and time-sensitive applications, and location-dependent mobile computing.</italic>

Exploiting location information for infostation-based hoarding
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
With the increasing popularity of mobile computing devices, the need to access information in mobile environments has grown rapidly. Since the information has to be accessed over wireless networks, mobile information systems often have to deal with problems like low bandwidth, high delay, and frequent disconnections. Information hoarding is a method that tries to overcome these problems by transferring information, which the user will probably need, in advance. The hoarding mechanism that we describe in this paper exploits the location dependence of the information access, which is often found in mobile information systems. Our simulation results show that it is beneficial to do so and that we achieve higher hit ratios than with a caching mechanism.

Locating application data across service discovery domains
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
The bulk of proposed pervasive computing devices such as PDAs and cellular telephones operate as thin clients within a larger infrastructure. To access services within their local environment, these devices participate in a service discovery protocol which involves a master directory that registers all services available in the local environment. These directories typically are isolated from each other. Devices that move across service discovery domains have no access to information outside their current local domain. In this paper we propose an application-level protocol called VIA that enables data sharing among discovery domains. Each directory maintains a table of active links to other directories that share related information. A set of linked directories forms a data cluster that can be queried by devices for information. The data cluster is distributed, self-organizing, responsive to data mobility, and robust to failures. Using application-defined data schemas, clusters organize themselves into a hierarchy for efficient querying and network resource usage. Through analysis and simulation we describe the behavior of VIA under different workloads and show that the protocol overhead for both maintaining a cluster and handling failures grows slowly with the number of gateways.

Preemptive routing in Ad Hoc networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
Existing on-demand ad-hoc routing algorithms initiate route discovery only after a path breaks, incurring a significant cost in detecting the disconnection and establishing a new route. In this work, we investigate adding proactive route selection and maintenance to on-demand ad-hoc routing algorithms. More specifically, when a path is likely to be broken, a warning is sent to the source indicating the likelihood of a disconnection. The source can then initiate path discovery early, potentially avoiding the disconnection altogether. A path is considered likely to break when the received packet power becomes close to the minimum detectable power (other approaches are possible). Care must be taken to avoid initiating false route warnings due to fluctuations in received power caused by fading, multipath effects and similar random transient phenomena. Experiments demonstrate that adding proactive route selection and maintenance to DSR and AODV (on-demand ad hoc routing protocols) significantly reduces the number of broken paths, with a small increase in protocol overhead. Packet latency and jitter also goes down in most cases. We also show some experimental results obtained by running TCP on top of the proactive routing schemes proposed. Several improvements and extensions are also discussed. Pro-active route selection and maintenance is general and can be used with other routing algorithms and optimizations to them.

Merit: A unified framework for routing protocol assessment in mobile AD Hoc networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
MERIT is a framework to assess routing protocols in mobile Ad hoc networks (manets). It is based on the novel concept of a shortest mobile path (SMP) in a mobile qraph, generalizing the traditional shortest path concept for the mobile environment. As a standard measure for routing protocols in a manet, the MERIT framework proposes the mean ratio of the cost of the actually used route to the cost of the optimal mobile path, under the same history of link metrics in the changing network topology. The MERIT spectrum takes the MERIT ratio as a function of parameters of interest yielding a multi-faceted representation of protocol effectiveness. This Mean Real vs. Ideal cosT (MERIT) framework is unifying in that it provides a measure that allows a protocol to be assessed independently of other protocols, within its own environment. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to solve the underlying SMP problem for important cases, making the approach practically feasible. We also investigate generalizations of and extensions within the MERIT framework.

Capacity of Ad Hoc wireless networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
Early simulation experience with wireless ad hoc networks suggests that their capacity can be surprisingly low, due to the requirement that nodes forward each others' packets. The achievable capacity depends on network size, traffic patterns, and detailed local radio interactions. This paper examines these factors alone and in combination, using simulation and analysis from first principles. Our results include both specific constants and general scaling relationships helpful in understanding the limitations of wireless ad hoc networks.We examine interactions of the 802.11 MAC and ad hoc forwarding and the effect on capacity for several simple configurations and traffic patterns. While 802.11 discovers reasonably good schedules, we nonetheless observe capacities markedly less than optimal for very simple chain and lattice networks with very regular traffic patterns. We validate some simulation results with experiments.We also show that the traffic pattern determines whether an ad hoc network's per node capacity will scale to large networks. In particular, we show that for total capacity to scale up with network size the average distance between source and destination nodes must remain small as the network grows. Non-local traffic-patterns in which this average distance grows with the network size result in a rapid decrease of per node capacity. Thus the question "Are large ad hoc networks feasible?" reduces to a question about the likely locality of communication in such networks.

Geography-informed energy conservation for Ad Hoc routing
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
We introduce a geographical adaptive fidelity (GAF) algorithm that reduces energy consumption in ad hoc wireless networks. GAF conserves energy by identifying nodes that are equivalent from a routing perspective and then turning off unnecessary nodes, keeping a constant level of routing fidelity. GAF moderates this policy using application- and system-level information; nodes that source or sink data remain on and intermediate nodes monitor and balance energy use. GAF is independent of the underlying ad hoc routing protocol; we simulate GAF over unmodified AODV and DSR. Analysis and simulation studies of GAF show that it can consume 40% to 60% less energy than an unmodified ad hoc routing protocol. Moreover, simulations of GAP suggest that network lifetime increases proportionally to node density; in one example, a four-fold increase in node density leads to network lifetime increase for 3 to 6 times (depending on the mobility pattern). More generally, GAF is an example of adaptive fidelity, a technique proposed for extending the lifetime of self-configuring systems by exploiting redundancy to conserve energy while maintaining application fidelity.

Span: An energy-efficient coordination algorithm for topology maintenance in Ad Hoc wireless networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
This paper presents Span, a power saving technique for multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks that reduces energy consumption without significantly diminishing the capacity or connectivity of the network. Span builds on the observation that when a region of a shared-channel wireless network bag a sufficient density of nodes, only a small number of them need be on at any time to forward traffic for active connections.Span is a distributed, randomized algorithm where nodes make local decisions on whether to sleep, or to join a forwarding backbone as a coordinator. Each node bases its decision on an estimate of how many of its neighbors will benefit from it being awake, and the amount of energy available to it. We give a randomized algorithm where coordinators rotate with time, demonstrating how localized node decisions lead to a connected, capacity-preserving global topology.Improvement in system lifetime due to Span increases as the ratio of idle-to-sleep energy consumption increases, and increases as the density of the network increases. For example, our simulations show that with a practical energy model, system lifetime of an 802.11 network in power saving mode with Span is a factor of two better than without. Span integrates nicely with 802.11-when run in conjunction with the 802.11 power saving mode, Span improves communication latency, capacity, and system lifetime.

Online power-aware routing in wireless Ad-hoc networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
This paper discusses online power-aware routing in large wireless ad-hoc networks for applications where the message sequence is not known. We seek to optimize the lifetime of the network. We show that online power-aware routing does not have a constant competitive ratio to the off-line optimal algorithm. We develop an approximation algorithm called max-min zP<subscrpt>min</subscrpt> that has a good empirical competitive ratio. To ensure scalability, we introduce a second online algorithm for power-aware routing. This hierarchical algorithm is called zone-based routing. Our experiments show that its performance is quite good.

Making computers disappear: appliance data services
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
Digital appliances designed to simplify everyday tasks are readily available to end consumers. For example, mobile users can retrieve Web content using handheld devices since content retrieval is well-supported by infrastructure services such as transformational proxies. However, the same type of support is lacking for input-centric devices, those that create content and allow users to share content. This lack of infrastructural support makes input-centric devices hard to use and less useful.The Appliance Data Services project seeks to explore a vision of an appliance computing world where users move data seamlessly among various devices. Based on this vision, we formulate three principles that guide the design of an architecture that helps realize this vision: bring devices to the forefront, minimize the number of device features, and place functionality in the network infrastructure. We evaluate our implementation of the ADS architecture based on these principles, and build applications using the ADS framework to evaluate the ease with which appliance computing applications can be built using the framework. We find that it is relatively simple to build and extend applications on ADS that make using digital devices easier, which results in the devices themselves becoming more useful.

m-links: An infrastructure for very small internet devices
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
In this paper we describe the Mobile Link (m-Links) infrastructure for utilizing existing World Wide Web content and services on wireless phones and other very small Internet terminals. Very small devices, typically with 3-20 lines of text, provide portability and other functionality while sacrificing usability as Internet terminals. In order to provide access on such limited hardware we propose a small device web navigation model that is more appropriate than the desktop computer's web browsing model. We introduce a middleware proxy, the Navigation Engine, to facilitate the navigation model by concisely displaying the Web's link (i.e., URL) structure. Because not all Web information is appropriately "linked," the Navigation Engine incorporates data-detectors to extract bits of useful information such as phone numbers and addresses. In order to maximize program-data composibility, multiple network-based services (similar to browser plug-ins) are keyed to a link's attributes such as its MIME type. We have built this system with an emphasis on user extensibility and we describe the design and implementation as well as a basic set of middleware services that we have found to be particularly important.

Smart kindergarten: sensor-based wireless networks for smart developmental problem-solving environments
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
Despite enormous progress in networking and computing technologies, their application has remained restricted to conventional person-to-person and person-to-computer communication. However, continual reduction in cost and form factor is now making it possible to imbed networking - even wireless networking - and computing capabilities not just in our PCs and laptops but also other objects. Further, a marriage of these ever tinier and cheaper processors and wireless network interfaces with emerging micro-sensors based on MEMS technology is allowing cheap sensing, processing, and communication capabilities to be unobtrusively embedded in familiar physical objects. The result is an emerging paradigm shift where the primary role of information technology would be to enhance or assist in "person to physical world communication via familiar physical objects with embedded (a) micro-sensors to react to external stimuli, and (b) wireless networking and computing engines for tetherless communication with compute servers and other networked embedded objects. In this paper we present the application of sensor-based wireless networks to a "Smart Kindergarten that we are developing to target developmental problem-solving environments for early childhood education. This is a natural application as young children learn by exploring and interacting with objects such as toys in their environment. Our envisioned system would enhance the education process by providing a childhood learning environment that is individualized to each child, adapts to the context, coordinates activities of multiple children, and allows continual unobtrusive evaluation of the learning process by the teacher. This would be done by wirelessly-networked, sensor-enhanced toys and other classroom objects with back-end middleware services and database techniques. We explore wireless networking, middleware, and data management technologies for realizing this application, and describe challenges arising from ad hoc distributed structure, unreliable sensing, large scale/density, and novel sensor data types that are characteristic of such deeply instrumented environments with inter-networked physical objects.

Exposure in wireless Ad-Hoc sensor networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks will provide one of the missing connections between the Internet and the physical world. One of the fundamental problems in sensor networks is the calculation of coverage. Exposure is directly related to coverage in that it is a measure of how well an object, moving on an arbitrary path, can be observed by the sensor network over a period of time.In addition to the informal definition, we formally define exposure and study its properties. We have developed an efficient and effective algorithm for exposure calculation in sensor networks, specifically for finding minimal exposure paths. The minimal exposure path provides valuable information about the worst case exposure-based coverage in sensor networks. The algorithm works for any given distribution of sensors, sensor and intensity models, and characteristics of the network. It provides an unbounded level of accuracy as a function of run time and storage. We provide an extensive collection of experimental results and study the scaling behavior of exposure and the proposed algorithm for its calculation.

Research challenges in wireless networks of biomedical sensors
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
Implanted biomedical devices have the potential to revolutionize medicine. Smart sensors, which are created by combining sensing materials with integrated circuitry, are being considered for several biomedical applications such as a glucose level monitor or a retina prosthesis. These devices require the capability to communicate with an external computer system (base station) via a wireless interface. The limited power and computational capabilities of smart sensor based biological implants present research challenges in several aspects of wireless networking due to the need for having a bio-compatible, fault-tolerant, energy-efficient, and scalable design. Further, em bedding thesesensors in humans add additional requirements. For example, the wireless networking solutions should be ultra-safe and reliable, work trouble-free in different geographical locations (although implants are typically not expected to move; they shouldn't restrict the movements of their human host), and require minimal maintenance. This necessitates application-specific solutions which are vastly different from traditional solutions.In this paper, we describe the potential of biomedical smart sensors. We then explain the challenges for wireless networking of human-embedded smart sensor arrays and our preliminary approach for wireless networking of a retina prosthesis. Our aim is to motivate vigorous research in this area by illustrating the need for more application-specific and novel approaches toward developing wireless networking solutions for human-implanted smart sensors.

Dynamic fine-grained localization in Ad-Hoc networks of sensors
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2001
The recent advances in radio and em beddedsystem technologies have enabled the proliferation of wireless microsensor networks. Such wirelessly connected sensors are released in many diverse environments to perform various monitoring tasks. In many such tasks, location awareness is inherently one of the most essential system parameters. It is not only needed to report the origins of events, but also to assist group querying of sensors, routing, and to answer questions on the network coverage. In this paper we present a novel approach to the localization of sensors in an ad-hoc network. We describe a system called AHLoS (Ad-Hoc Localization System) that enables sensor nodes to discover their locations using a set distributed iterative algorithms. The operation of AHLoS is demonstrated with an accuracy of a few centimeters using our prototype testbed while scalability and performance are studied through simulation.

The 802.11 standard for wireless networks includes a Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol, used to protect link-layer communications from eavesdropping and other attacks. We have discovered several serious security flaws in the protocol, stemming from mis-application of cryptographic primitives. The flaws lead to a number of practical attacks that demonstrate that WEP fails to achieve its security goals. In this paper, we discuss in detail each of the flaws, the underlying security principle violations, and the ensuing attacks.

SPINS: security protocols for sensor networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
As sensor networks edge closer towards wide-spread deployment, security issues become a central concern. So far, much research has focused on making sensor networks feasible and useful, and has not concentrated on security.We present a suite of security building blocks optimized for resource-constrained environments and wireless communication. SPINS has two secure building blocks: SNEP and &mgr;TESLA SNEP provides the following important baseline security primitives: Data confidentiality, two-party data authentication, and data freshness. A particularly hard problem is to provide efficient broadcast authentication, which is an important mechanism for sensor networks. &mgr;TESLA is a new protocol which provides authenticated broadcast for severely resource-constrained environments. We implemented the above protocols, and show that they are practical even on minimal hardware: the performance of the protocol suite easily matches the data rate of our network. Additionally, we demonstrate that the suite can be used for building higher level protocols.

Distributed multi-hop scheduling and medium access with delay and throughput constraints
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
Providing quality of service in random access multi-hop wireless networks requires support from both medium access and packet scheduling algorithms. However, due to the distributed nature of ad hoc networks, nodes may not be able to determine the next packet that would be transmitted in a (hypothetical) centralized and ideal dynamic priority scheduler. In this paper, we develop two mechanisms for QoS communication in multi-hop wireless networks. First, we devise distributed priority scheduling a technique that piggybacks the priority tag of a node's head-of-line packet onto handshake and data packets; e.g., RTS/DATA packets in IEEE 802.11. By monitoring transmitted packets, each node maintains a scheduling table which is used to assess the node's priority level relative to other nodes. We then incorporate this scheduling table into existing IEEE 802.11 priority back-off schemes to approximate the idealized schedule. Second, we observe that congestion, link errors, and the random nature of medium access prohibit an exact realization of the ideal schedule. Consequently, we devise a scheduling scheme termedmulti-hop coordinationso that downstream nodes can increase a packet's relative priority to make up for excessive delays incurred upstream. We next develop a simple analytical model to quantitatively explore these two mechanisms. In the former case, we study the impact of the probability of overhearing another packet's priority index on the scheme's ability to achieve the ideal schedule. In the latter case, we explore the role of multi-hop coordination in increasing the probability that a packet satisfies its end-to-end QoS target. Finally, we perform a set of ns-2 simulations to study the scheme's performance under more realistic conditions.

A new approach to channel access scheduling for Ad Hoc networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
Three types of collision-free channel access protocols for ad hoc networks are presented. These protocols are derived from a novel approach to contention resolution that allows each node to elect deterministically one or multiple winners for channel access in a given contention context (e.g., a time slot), given the identifiers of its neighbors one and two hops away. The new protocols are shown to be fair and capable of achieving maximum utilization of the channel bandwidth. The delay and throughput characteristics of the contention resolution algorithms are analyzed, and the performance of the three types of channel access protocols is studied by simulations.

A transmission control scheme for media access in sensor networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
We study the problem of media access control in the novel regime of sensor networks, where unique application behavior and tight constraints in computation power, storage, energy resources, and radio technology have shaped this design space to be very different from that found in traditional mobile computing regime. Media access control in sensor networks must not only be energy efficient but should also allow fair bandwidth allocation to the infrastructure for all nodes in a multihop network. We propose an adaptive rate control mechanism aiming to support these two goals and find that such a scheme is most effective in achieving our fairness goal while being energy efficient for both low and high duty cycle of network traffic.

A rate-adaptive MAC protocol for multi-Hop wireless networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
Wireless local area networks (W-LANs) have become increasingly popular due to the recent availability of affordable devices that are capable of communicating at high data rates. These high rates are possible, in part, through new modulation schemes that are optimized for the channel conditions bringing about a dramatic increase in bandwidth efficiency. Since the choice of which modulation scheme to use depends on the current state of the transmission channel, newer wireless devices often support multiple modulation schemes, and hence multiple datarates, with mechanisms to switch between them Users are given the option to either select an operational datarate manually or to let the device automatically choose the appropriate modulation scheme (data rate) to match the prevailing conditions. Automatic rate selection protocols have been studied for cellular networks but there have been relatively few proposals for W-LANs. In this paper we present a rate adaptive MAC protocol called the Receiver-Based AutoRate (RBAR) protocol. The novelty of RBAR is that its rate adaptation mechanism is in the receiver instead of in the sender. This is in contrast to existing schemes in devices like the WaveLAN II [15]. We show that RBAR is better because it results in a more efficient channel quality estimation which is then reflected in a higher overall throughput Our protocol is based on the RTS/CTS mechanism and consequently it can be incorporated into many medium access control protocols including the widely popular IEEE 802.11 protocol. Simulation results of an implementation of RBAR inside IEEE 802.11 show that RBAR performs consistently well.

Dynamic voltage scaling on a low-power microprocessor
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
Power consumption is the limiting factor for the functionality of future wearable devices. Since interactive applications like wireless information access generate bursts of activities, it is important to match the performance of the wearable device accordingly. This paper describes a system with a microprocessor whose speed can be varied (frequency scaling) as well as its supply voltage. Voltage scaling is important for reducing power consumption to very low values when operating at low speeds. Measurements show that the energy per instruction at minimal speed is 1/5 of the energy required at full speed. The frequency and voltage can be scaled dynamically from user space in only 140 &mgr;s. This allows power-aware applications to quickly adjust the performance level of the processor whenever the workload changes. Experiments with an H.263 video benchmark show that the power-aware decoder outperforms a static fixed-frequency policy as well as a dynamic interval-based scheduler.

Automatic performance setting for dynamic voltage scaling
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
The emphasis on processors that are both low power and high performance has resulted in the incorporation of dynamic voltage scaling into processor designs. This feature allows one to make fine granularity trade-offs between power use and performance, provided there is a mechanism in the OS to control that trade-off. In this paper, we describe a novel software approach to automatically controlling dynamic voltage scaling in order to optimize energy use. Our mechanism is implemented in the Linux kernel and requires no modification of user programs. Unlike previous automated approaches, our method works equally well with irregular and multiprogrammed workloads. Moreover, it has the ability to ensure that the quality of interactive performance is within user specified parameters. Our experiments show that as a result of our algorithm, processor energy savings of as much as 75% can be achieved with only a minimal impact on the user experience.

Physical layer driven protocol and algorithm design for energy-efficient wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
The potential for collaborative, robust networks of microsensors has attracted a great deal of research attention. For the most part, this is due to the compelling applications that will be enabled once wireless microsensor networks are in place; location-sensing, environmental sensing, medical monitoring and similar applications are all gaining interest. However, wireless microsensor networks pose numerous design challenges. For applications requiring long-term, robust sensing, such as military reconnaissance, one important challenge is to design sensor networks that have long system lifetimes. This challenge is especially difficult due to the energy-constrained nature of the devices. In order to design networks that have extremely long lifetimes, we propose a physical layer driven approach to designing protocols and algorithms. We first present a hardware model for our wireless sensor node and then introduce the design of physical layer aware protocols, algorithms, and applications that minimize energy consumption of the system. Our approach prescribes methods that can be used at all levels of the hierarchy to take advantage of the underlying hardware. We also show how to reduce energy consumption of non-ideal hardware through physical layer aware algorithms and protocols.

TCP westwood: Bandwidth estimation for enhanced transport over wireless links
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
TCP Westwood (TCPW) is a sender-side modification of the TCP congestion window algorithm that improves upon the performance of TCP Reno in wired as well as wireless networks. The improvement is most significant in wireless networks with lossy links, since TCP Westwood relies on end-to-end bandwidth estimation to discriminate the cause of packet loss (congestion or wireless channel effect) which is a major problem in TCP Reno. An important distinguishing feature of TCP Westwood with respect to previous wireless TCP "extensions" is that it does not require inspection and/or interception of TCP packets at intermediate (proxy) nodes. Rather, it fully complies with the end-to-end TCP design principle. The key innovative idea is to continuously measure at the TCP source the rate of the connection by monitoring the rate of returning ACKs. The estimate is then used to compute congestion window and slow start threshold after a congestion episode, that is, after three duplicate acknowledgments or after a timeout. The rationale of this strategy is simple: in contrast with TCP Reno, which "blindly" halves the congestion window after three duplicate ACKs, TCP Westwood attempts to select a slow start threshold and a congestion window which are consistent with the effective bandwidth used at the time congestion is experienced. We call this mechanism faster recovery. The proposed mechanism is particularly effective over wireless links where sporadic losses due to radio channel problems are often misinterpreted as a symptom of congestion by current TCP schemes and thus lead to an unnecessary window reduction. Experimental studies reveal improvements in throughput performance, as well as in fairness. In addition, friendliness with TCP Reno was observed in a set of experiments showing that TCP Reno connections are not starved by TCPW connections. Most importantly, TCPW is extremely effective in mixed wired and wireless networks where throughput improvements of up to 550% are observed. Finally, TCPW performs almost as well as localized link layer approaches such as the popular Snoop scheme, without incurring the O/H of a specialized link layer protocol.

Mobile network estimation
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2001
Mobile systems must adapt their behavior to changing network conditions. To do this, they must accurately estimate available network capacity. Producing quality estimates is challenging because network observations are noisy, particularly in mobile, ad hoc networks. Current systems depend on simple, exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) filters. These filters are either able to detect true changes quickly or to mask observed noise and transients, but cannot do both. In this paper, we present four filters designed to react quickly to persistent changes while tolerating transient noise. Such filters are agile when possible, but stable when necessary, adapting their behavior to prevailing conditions. These filters are evaluated in a variety of networking situations, including persistent and transient change, congestion, and topology changes. We find that one filter, based on techniques from statistical process control provides performance superior to the other three. Compared to two EWMA filters, one agile and the other stable, it is able to offer the agility of the former in four of five scenarios and the stability of the latter in three of four scenarios.

Design and analysis of a new approach to multiple burst admission control for cdma2000
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
On the verge of realizing truly ubiquitous access to high quality data (e.g., media, financial, etc.), an efficient burst admission control algorithm is crucial in third generation (3G) wireless communication systems based on wideband CDMA standards. In this paper, we propose and analyze the performance of a novel burst admission technique, called the multiple- burst admission-spatial dimension algorithm (MBA-SD) to judiciously allocate the precious channels in wideband CDMA systems to burst requests. The major contributions of the present paper are the novel formulation of the problem as an integer programming problem and the derivation of an optimal algorithm for scheduling the burst requests. Both the forward link and the reverse link burst requests are considered and the system is simulated by dynamic simulations which takes into account of the user mobility, power control, and soft hand-off. We found that significant performance improvement, in terms of data user capacity coverage, and admission and outage probabilities, could be achieved by our scheme compared to the existing burst assignment algorithms.

Mobile connectivity protocols and throughput measurements in the Ricochet Microcellular data network (MCDN) system
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
We describe the protocols implemented in the Ricochet MCDN system to provide continuous connectivity to mobile users traveling up to 70 mph. These protocols are general in nature for any frequency-hopping microcell-based system, particularly those that follow the FCC part 15.247 rules [9] and operate in unlicensed spectrum. We also present throughput measurements as a function of velocity and describe a model to predict those numbers based upon the protocols implemented. The MCDN system is a mesh-based system of microcells that are connected wirelessly to an interspersed mesh of wired access points (WAPs) that cover approximately 12 square miles on average [7]. The average microcell density is approximately 5-6 per square mile, with 3-8 overlapping cells at each point. Since the system is entirely packet-based, we have instantaneous hand-off between microcells as there are no complicated cellular-type negotiations for circuits required as all of the information needed to route the packet through the system is included in the header; however, when traveling through the mesh of microcells at a high rate of speed, the mobile unit must acquire new microcells fast enough to ensure continuous connectivity. The system must also know how to route packets to the mobile unit as it drops old cells and acquires new ones, as well as being able to contact a moving mobile unit. This paper discusses the acquisition, registration, and routing protocols that make this possible and reviews performance data of typical mobile users.

IP paging service for mobile hosts
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
In wireless networks, mobile hosts must update the network with their current location in order to get packets delivered. Paging facilitates efficient power management at the mobile host by allowing the host to update the networkless frequently at the cost of providing the network with only approximate location information. The network determines the exact location of a mobile host through paging before delivering packets destined to the mobile host. In this paper, we propose the concept of paging as an IP service. IP paging enables a common infrastructure and protocol to support the different wireless interfaces such as CDMA, GPRS, wireless LAN, avoiding the duplication of several application layer paging implementations and the inter-operability issues that exists today. We present the design, implementation, and detailed qualitative and quantitative evaluation, using measurements and simulation, of three IP-based paging protocols for mobile hosts.

A cost-efficient signaling protocol for mobility application part (MAP) in IMT-2000 systems
Proceedings of the 7th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2001
An efficient signaling protocol for mobility application part (MAP) is essential to mobility support when mobile terminals roam between different networks in next generation wireless systems such as IMT-2000. In this paper, a new signaling protocol is proposed to reduce the overhead caused by mobility management, alleviating network load and consumption of network resources. Moreover, the new protocol effectively reduces the latency of call delivery and call loss rate due to crossing wireless systems with different standards and signaling protocols. Instead of performing location registration after a mobile user arrives at the new system, the mobile user is required to update its location information prior to its reaching the boundary of two systems. Results in this study demonstrate that the new protocol yields significant benefits in terms of reducing signaling costs, delays, and call loss rates.

Opportunistic media access for multirate ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
The IEEE 802.11 wireless media access standard supports multiple data rates at the physical layer. Moreover, various auto rate adaptation mechanisms at the medium access layer have been proposed to utilize this multi-rate capability by automatically adapting the transmission rate to best match the channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Opportunistic Auto Rate (OAR) protocol to better exploit durations of high-quality channels conditions. The key mechanism of the OAR protocol is to opportunistically send multiple back-to-back data packets whenever the channel quality is good. As channel coherence times typically exceed multiple packet transmission times for both mobile and non-mobile users, OAR achieves significant throughput gains as compared to state-of-the-art auto-rate adaptation mechanisms. Moreover, over longer time scales, OAR ensures that all nodes are granted channel access for the same time-shares as achieved by single-rate IEEE 802.11. We describe mechanisms to implement OAR on top of any existing auto-rate adaptation scheme in a nearly IEEE 802.11 compliant manner. We also analytically study OAR and characterize the gains in throughput as a function of the channel conditions. Finally, we perform an extensive set of ns-2 simulations to study the impact of such factors as node velocity, channel conditions, and topology on the throughput of OAR.

A power control MAC protocol for ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
This paper presents a power control MAC protocol based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. Several researchers have proposed a simple modification of IEEE 802.11 to incorporate power control. The main idea of these power control schemes is to use different power levels for RTS-CTS and DATA-ACK. Specifically, maximum transmit power is used for RTS-CTS, and the minimum required transmit power is used for DATA-ACK transmissions in order to save energy. However, we show that this scheme can degrade network throughput and can result in higher energy consumption than using IEEE 802.11 without power control. We propose an improved power control protocol which does not degrade throughput and yields energy saving.

Transmission scheduling in ad hoc networks with directional antennas
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
Directional antennas can adaptively select radio signals of interest in specific directions, while filtering out unwanted interference from other directions. Although a couple of medium access protocols based on random access schemes have been proposed for networks with directional antennas, they suffer from high probability of collisions because of their dependence on omnidirectional mode for the transmission or reception of control packets in order to establish directional links. We propose a distributed receiver-oriented multiple access (ROMA) channel access scheduling protocol for ad hoc networks with directional antennas, each of which can form multiple beams and commence several simultaneous communication sessions. Unlike random access schemes that use on-demand handshakes or signal scanning to resolve communication targets, ROMA determines a number of links for activation in every time slot using only two-hop topology information. It is shown that significant improvements on network throughput and delay can be achieved by exploiting the multi-beam forming capability of directional antennas in both transmission and reception. The performance of ROMA is studied by simulations, and compared with a well-know static scheduling scheme that is based on global topology information.

Using directional antennas for medium access control in ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
Previous research in wireless ad hoc networks typically assumes the use of omnidirectional antennas at all nodes. With omnidirectional antennas, while two nodes are communicating using a given channel, MAC protocols such as IEEE 802.11 require all other nodes in the vicinity to stay silent. With directional antennas, two pairs of nodes located in each other's vicinity may potentially communicate simultaneously, depending on the directions of transmission. This can increase spatial reuse of the wireless channel. In addition, the higher gain of directional antennas allows a node to communicate with other nodes located far away, implying that messages could be delivered to the destination in fewer hops. In this paper, we propose a MAC protocol that exploits the characteristics of directional antennas. Our design focuses on using multi-hop RTSs to establish links between distant nodes, and then transmit CTS, DATA and ACK over a single hop. Results show that our directional MAC protocol can perform better than IEEE 802.11, although we find that the performance is dependent on the topology configuration and the flow patterns in the system.

TCP/IP performance over 3G wireless links with rate and delay variation
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
Wireless link losses result in poor TCP throughput since losses are perceived as congestion by TCP, resulting in source throttling. In order to mitigate this effect, 3G wireless link designers have augmented their system with extensive local retransmission mechanisms. In addition, in order to increase throughput, intelligent channel state based scheduling have also been introduced. While these mechanisms have reduced the impact of losses on TCP throughput and improved the channel utilization, these gains have come at the expense of increased delay and rate variability. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the impact of variable rate and variable delay on long-lived TCP performance. We propose a model to explain and predict TCP's throughput over a link with variable rate and/or delay. We also propose a network-based solution called Ack Regulator that mitigates the effect of variable rate and/or delay without significantly increasing the round trip time, while improving TCP performance by up to 40%.

A transport layer approach for achieving aggregate bandwidths on multi-homed mobile hosts
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
Due to the availability of a wide variety of wireless access technologies, a mobile host can potentially have subscriptions and access to more than one wireless network at a given time. In this paper, we consider such a multi-homed mobile host, and address the problem of achieving bandwidth aggregation by striping data across the multiple interfaces of the mobile host. We show that both link layer striping approaches and application layer techniques that stripe data across multiple TCP sockets do not achieve the optimal bandwidth aggregation due to a variety of factors specific to wireless networks. We propose an end-to-end transport layer approach called pTCP that effectively performs bandwidth aggregation on multi homed mobile hosts. We show through simulations that pTCP achieves the desired goals under a variety of network conditions.

Reliable network connections
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
We present two systems, reliable sockets (rocks) and reliable packets (racks), that provide transparent network connection mobility using only user- level mechanisms. Each system can detect a connection failure within seconds of its occurrence, preserve the endpoint of a failed connection in a suspended state for an arbitrary period of time, and automatically reconnect, even when one end of the connection changes IP address, with correct recovery of in-flight data. To allow rocks and racks to interoperate with ordinary clients and servers, we introduce a general user-level Enhancement Detection Protocol that enables the remote detection of rocks and racks, or any other socket enhancement system, but does not affect applications that use ordinary sockets. Rocks and racks provide the same functionality but have different implementation models: rocks intercept and modify the behavior of the sockets API by using an interposed library, while racks uses a packet filter to intercept and modify the packets exchanged over a connection. Racks and rocks introduce small throughput and latency overheads that we deem acceptable for the level of mobility and reliability they provide.

Analysis of a campus-wide wireless network

2002
Understanding usage patterns in wireless local-area networks (WLANs) is critical for those who develop, deploy, and manage WLAN technology, as well as those who develop systems and application software for wireless networks. This paper presents results from the largest and most comprehensive trace of network activity in a large, production wireless LAN. For eleven weeks we traced the activity of nearly two thousand users drawn from a general campus population, using a campus-wide network of 476 access points spread over 161 buildings. Our study expands on those done by Tang and Baker, with a significantly larger and broader population.We found that residential traffic dominated all other traffic, particularly in residences populated by newer students; students are increasingly choosing a wireless laptop as their primary computer. Although web protocols were the single largest component of traffic volume, network backup and file sharing contributed an unexpectedly large amount to the traffic. Although there was some roaming within a network session, we were surprised by the number of situations in which cards roamed excessively, unable to settle on one access point. Cross-subnet roams were an especial problem, because they broke IP connections, indicating the need for solutions that avoid or accommodate such roams.

Minimizing energy for wireless web access with bounded slowdown
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
On many battery-powered mobile computing devices, the wireless network is a significant contributor to the total energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between energy-saving protocols and TCP performance for Web like transfers. We show that the popular IEEE 802.11 power-saving mode (PSM), a "static" protocol, can harm performance by increasing fast round trip times (RTTs) to 100 ms; and that under typical Web browsing workloads, current implementations will unnecessarily spend energy waking up during long idle periods.To overcome these problems, we present the Bounded-Slowdown (BSD) protocol, a PSM that dynamically adapts to network activity. BSD is an optimal solution to the problem of minimizing energy consumption while guaranteeing that a connection's RTT does not increase by more than a factor p over its base RTT, where p is a protocol parameter that exposes the trade-off between minimizing energy and reducing latency. works by staying awake for a short period of time after the link idle. We present several trace-driven simulation results that show that, compared to a static PSM, the Bounded Slowdown protocol reduces average Web page retrieval times by 5--64%, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by 1--14% (and by 13X compared to no power management).

Link layer assisted mobile IP fast handoff method over wireless LAN networks
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
The growing popularity of IEEE 802.11 has made wireless LAN a potential candidate technology for providing high speed wireless access services. Also, by supporting Mobile IP, wireless LAN can meet demands for expanded wireless access coverage while maintaining continuous connectivity from one wireless LAN to another. In the Mobile IP procedure, mobile node movement can be detected from advertisements of foreign agents that differ from the previously received advertisement and the new "care-of" address is registered with the home agent. However, user packets are not forwarded to the new foreign agent until registration is completed and this interruption may degrade the quality of service especially in real-time applications such as audio and video or may lower the TCP throughput due to retransmission timeout. To tackle these issues, we propose a new low latency handoff method, where access points used in a wireless LAN environment and a dedicated MAC bridge are jointly used to alleviate packet loss without altering the Mobile IP specifications. In this paper, we present the design architecture of the proposed method and evaluate its performance in an actual network environment to verify the effectiveness of our approach.

On the interdependence of routing and data compression in multi-hop sensor networks
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
We consider a problem of broadcast communication in a multi-hop sensor network, in which samples of a random field are collected at each node of the network, and the goal is for all nodes to obtain an estimate of the entire field within a prescribed distortion value. The main idea we explore in this paper is that of jointly compressing the data generated by different nodes as this information travels over multiple hops, to eliminate correlations in the representation of the sampled field. Our main contributions are: (a) we obtain, using simple network flow concepts, conditions on the rate/distortion function of the random field, so as to guarantee that any node can obtain the measurements collected at every other node in the network, quantized to within any prescribed distortion value; and (b), we construct a large class of physically-motivated stochastic models for sensor data, for which we are able to prove that the joint rate/distortion function of all the data generated by the whole network grows slower than the bounds found in (a). A truly novel aspect of our work is the tight coupling between routing and source coding, explicitly formulated in a simple and analytically tractable model---to the best of our knowledge, this connection had not been studied before.

A two-tier data dissemination model for large-scale wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
Sink mobility brings new challenges to large-scale sensor networking. It suggests that information about each mobile sink's location be continuously propagated through the sensor field to keep all sensor nodes updated with the direction of forwarding future data reports. Unfortunately frequent location updates from multiple sinks can lead to both excessive drain of sensors' limited battery power supply and increased collisions in wireless transmissions. In this paper we describe TTDD, a Two-Tier Data Dissemination approach that provides scalable and efficient data delivery to multiple mobile sinks. Each data source in TTDD proactively builds a grid structure which enables mobile sinks to continuously receive data on the move by flooding queries within a local cell only. TTDD's design exploits the fact that sensor nodes are stationary and location-aware to construct and maintain the grid structures with low overhead. We have evaluated TTDD performance through both analysis and extensive simulation experiments. Our results show that TTDD handles multiple mobile sinks efficiently with performance comparable with that of stationary sinks.

Wake on wireless: an event driven energy saving strategy for battery operated devices
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
The demand for an all-in-one phone with integrated personal information management and data access capabilities is beginning to accelerate. While personal digital assistants (PDAs) with built-in cellular, WiFi, and Voice-Over-IP technologies have the ability to serve these needs in a single package, the rate at which energy is consumed by PDA-based phones is very high. Thus, these devices can quickly drain their own batteries and become useless to their owner.In this paper, we introduce a technique to increase the battery lifetime of a PDA-based phone by reducing its idle power, the power a device consumes in a "standby" state. To reduce the idle power, we essentially shut down the device and its wireless network card when the device is not being used---the device is powered only when an incoming call is received. Using this technique, we can increase the battery lifetime by up to 115%.In this paper, we describe the design of our "wake-on-wireless" energy-saving strategy and the prototype device we implemented. To evaluate our technique, we compare it with alternative approaches. Our results show that our technique can provide a significant lifetime improvement over other technologies.

Minimum-energy broadcast in all-wireless networks: NP-completeness and distribution issues
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2002
In all-wireless networks a crucial problem is to minimize energy consumption, as in most cases the nodes are battery-operated. We focus on the problem of power-optimal broadcast, for which it is well known that the broadcast nature of the radio transmission can be exploited to optimize energy consumption. Several authors have conjectured that the problem of power-optimal broadcast is NP-complete. We provide here a formal proof, both for the general case and for the geometric one; in the former case, the network topology is represented by a generic graph with arbitrary weights, whereas in the latter a Euclidean distance is considered. We then describe a new heuristic, Embedded Wireless Multicast Advantage. We show that it compares well with other proposals and we explain how it can be distributed.

Investigating upper bounds on network lifetime extension for cell-based energy conservation techniques in stationary ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
Cooperative cell-based strategies have been recently proposed as a technique for extending the lifetime of wireless ad hoc networks, while only slightly impacting network performance. The effectiveness of this approach depends heavily on the node density: the higher it is, the more consistent energy savings can potentially be achieved. However, no general analyses of network lifetime have been done either for a base network (one without any energy conservation technique) or for one using cooperative energy conservation strategies. In this paper, we investigate the lifetime/density tradeoff under the hypothesis that nodes are distributed uniformly at random in a given region, and that the traffic is evenly distributed across the network. We also analyze the case where the node density is just sufficient to ensure that the network is connected with high probability. This analysis, which is supported by the results of extensive simulations, shows that even in this low density scenario, cell-based strategies can significantly extend network lifetime.

Resource control for elastic traffic in CDMA networks
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
We present a framework for resource control in CDMA networks carrying elastic traffic, considering both the uplink and the downlink direction. The framework is based on microeconomics and congestion pricing, and seeks to exploit the joint control of the transmission rate and the signal quality in order to achieve efficient utilization of network resources, in a distributed and decentralized manner. An important feature of the framework is that it incorporates both the congestion for shared resources in wireless and wired networks, and the cost of battery power at mobile hosts. We prove that for elastic traffic, where users value only their average throughput, the user's net utility maximization problem can be decomposed into two simpler problems: one involving the selection of the optimal signal quality, and one involving the selection of the optimal transmission rate. Based on this result, the selection of signal quality can be performed as done today using outer loop power control, while rate adaptation can be integrated with rate adaptation at the transport layer.

Capacity of multi-service cellular networks with transmission-rate control: a queueing analysis
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
In this paper we compute the uplink capacity of power-control CDMA mobile networks with an idealized power control, that contain best-effort type applications, i.e. applications whose transmission rate can be controlled. An arriving best-effort call is assumed to have a fixed amount of traffic to send, so the transmission rate assigned to it determines the duration of the call. We allow for multi-services (so that mobile stations have different quality of service requirements). Unlike some previous published work where soft blocking was considered (and the system was thus allowed to operate beyond capacity), we assume that a call admission mechanism is implemented in order to prevent a new call to arrive when the system is already saturated. This guarantees the quality of service of ongoing calls. Our first result is that slowing the transmission rates in the case of a single cell with homogeneous quality of service characteristics increases capacity. This suggests that there is a limit capacity that can be approached when slowing down the transmission rates. We identify this limit and show that it has the following property: as long as the arrival rate of information is below some level, blocking probability can become arbitrarily small by sufficiently slowing down the transmission rates. We then extend the results to the general heterogeneous and multi-cell case.

Efficient integration of multi-hop wireless and wired networks with QoS constraints
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
This work considers the problem of designing an efficient and low-cost infrastructure for connecting static multi-hop wireless networks with wired backbone, while ensuring QoS requirements such as bandwidth and delay. This infrastructure is useful for designing low cost and fast deployed access networks in rural and suburban areas. It may also be used for providing access to sensor networks or for efficient facility placement in wireless networks. In these networks some nodes are chosen as access points and function as gateways to access a wired backbone. Each access point serves a cluster of its nearby user and a spanning tree rooted at the access point is used for message delivery. The work addresses both the design optimization and the operation aspects of the system. From the design perspective, we seek for a partition of the network nodes into minimal number of disjoint clusters that satisfy multiple constraints; Each cluster is required to be a connected graph with an upper bound on its radius. We assume that each node has a weight (representing its bandwidth requirement) and the total weight of all cluster nodes is also bounded. We show that these clustering requirements can be formulated as an instance of the Capacitated Facility Location problem (CFLP) with additional constraints. By breaking the problem into two sub-problems and solving each one separately, we propose polynomial time approximation algorithms that calculate solutions within a constant factor of the optimal ones. From the operation viewpoint, we introduce an adaptive delivery mechanism that maximizes the throughput of each cluster without violating the QoS constraints.

Robotics-based location sensing using wireless ethernet
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
A key subproblem in the construction of location-aware systems is the determination of the position of a mobile device. This paper describes the design, implementation and analysis of a system for determining position inside a building from measured RF signal strengths of packets on an IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet network. Previous approaches to location awareness with RF signals have been severely hampered by non-linearity, noise and complex correlations due to multi-path effects, interference and absorption. The design of our system begins with the observation that determining position from complex, noisy and non-linear signals is a well-studied problem in the field of robotics. Using only off-the-shelf hardware, we achieve robust position estimation to within a meter in our experimental context and after adequate training of our system. We can also coarsely determine our orientation and can track our position as we move. By applying recent advances in probabilistic inference of position and sensor fusion from noisy signals, we show that the RF emissions from base stations as measured by off-the-shelf wireless Ethernet cards are sufficiently rich in information to permit a mobile device to reliably track its location.

On balancing between transcoding overhead and spatial consumption in content adaptation
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
We propose a method that can find the optimal tradeoff point between transcoding overhead (CPU cost) and storage needed for the various pre-processed content variants (I/O cost). The method selectively pre-adapts a subset of content variants and leaves the generation of the residue to dynamic content adaptation with this pre-adapted subset as an input. We prove bounds regarding the optimality of the algorithm employed. The proposed model creates a collaborative environment across the components of client, proxy and server, based on which we study the distribution of adaptation complexity across these components. We use simulation to verify the projected benefits. The method has been successfully implemented in a trial PDF document content adaptation system.

Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
As of now, it is not uncommon for one to use multiple computers in separate places such as at home, office or school. A number of applications currently exist to allow a user to easily access and control these computers remotely via a notebook computer or web page. Unfortunately, even with such solutions, it is rather inconvenient, for example, to try accessing your computer while walking downtown or riding a train. On the other hand, considering that cellular phones have been accepted as multi-function devices capable of karaoke, digital photography and web browsing in countries like Japan, it may prove beneficial to support remote PC access on a cellular phone. With this in mind, we created Rajicon, a system to provide an easy to use interface to remotely operate a PC's GUI operating system via a cellular phone. Rajicon supports image based navigation of a remote PC's desktop and mouse/key operations. In addition, Rajicon provides functions for keyboard shortcuts, specialized window adjustment operations and text extraction. We have performed extensive evaluations with five subjects and discuss the results in this paper. We also discuss the lead author's latest adaption of Rajicon to a PDA.

Challenges: environmental design for pervasive computing systems
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
We argue that pervasive computing offers not only tremendous opportunities and exciting research challenges but also possible negative environmental impacts, particularly in terms of physical waste and energy consumption. These environmental impacts will come under increasing government and consumer scrutiny, and like other disciplines (e.g. architecture, transportation), pervasive computing will have to adapt accordingly. Further, we argue that software-related issues will play an increasing role in reducing the environmental impact of computing. We thus propose that an important challenge for pervasive computing is to develop research in new architectures, design methodologies, metrics, algorithms and operating systems to minimize these impacts. We then discuss specific research issues and questions that arise in three phases of the device lifecycle: minimizing resource usage for manufacture and operation, maximizing device lifetime, and improving recyclability.

Challenge: integrating mobile wireless devices into the computational grid
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
One application domain the mobile computing community has not yet entered is that of grid computing -- the aggregation of network-connected computers to form a large-scale, distributed system used to tackle complex scientific or commercial problems. In this paper we present the challenge of harvesting the increasingly widespread availability of Internet connected wireless mobile devices such as PDAs and laptops to be beneficially used within the emerging national and global computational grid. The integration of mobile wireless consumer devices into the Grid initially seems unlikely due to the inherent limitations typical of mobile devices, such as reduced CPU performance, small secondary storage, heightened battery consumption sensitivity, and unreliable low-bandwidth communication. However, the millions of laptops and PDAs sold annually suggest that this untapped abundance should not be prematurely dismissed. Given that the benefits of combining the resources of mobile devices with the computational grid are potentially enormous, one must compensate for the inherent limitations of these devices in order to successfully utilise them in the Grid. In this paper we identify the research challenges arising from this problem and propose our vision of a potential architectural solution. We suggest a proxy based, clustered system architecture with favourable deployment, interoperability, scalability, adaptivity, and fault-tolerance characteristics as well as an economic model to stimulate future research in this emerging field.

Challenge: recombinant computing and the speakeasy approach
Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2002
Interoperability among a group of devices, applications, and services is typically predicated on those entities having some degree of prior knowledge of each another. In general, they must be written to understand the type of thing with which they will interact, including the details of communication as well as semantic knowledge such as when and how to communicate. This paper presents a case for "recombinant computing" -- a set of common interaction patterns that leverage mobile code to allow rich interactions among computational entities with only limited a priori knowledge of one another. We have been experimenting with a particular embodiment of these ideas, which we call Speakeasy. It is designed to support ad hoc, end user configurations of hardware and software, and provides patterns for data exchange, user control, discovery of new services and devices, and contextual awareness.

Enhancing TCP fairness in ad hoc wireless networks using neighborhood RED
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
Significant TCP unfairness in ad hoc wireless networks has been reported during the past several years. This unfairness results from the nature of the shared wireless medium and location dependency. If we view a node and its interfering nodes to form a "neighborhood", the aggregate of local queues at these nodes represents the distributed queue for this neighborhood. However, this queue is not a FIFO queue. Flows sharing the queue have different, dynamically changing priorities determined by the topology and traffic patterns. Thus, they get different feedback in terms of packet loss rate and packet delay when congestion occurs. In wired networks, the Randomly Early Detection (RED) scheme was found to improve TCP fairness. In this paper, we show that the RED scheme does not work when running on individual queues in wireless nodes. We then propose a Neighborhood RED (NRED) scheme, which extends the RED concept to the distributed neighborhood queue. Simulation studies confirm that the NRED scheme can improve TCP unfairness substantially in ad hoc networks. Moreover, the NRED scheme acts at the network level, without MAC protocol modifications. This considerably simplifies its deployment.

A comparison of mechanisms for improving mobile IP handoff latency for end-to-end TCP
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
Handoff latency results in packet losses and severe End-to-End TCP performance degradation as TCP, perceiving these losses as congestion, causes source throttling or retransmission. In order to mitigate these effects, various Mobile IP(v6) extensions have been designed to augment the base Mobile IP with hierarchical registration management, address pre-fetching and local retransmission mechanisms. While these methods have reduced the impact of losses on TCP goodput and improved handoff latency, no comparative studies have been done regarding the relative performance amongst them. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluated the impact of layer-3 handoff latency on End-to-End TCP for various Mobile IP(v6) extensions. Five such frameworks are compared with the base Mobile IPv6 framework, namely, i) Hierarchical Mobile IPv6, ii) Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 with Fast-handover, iii) (Flat) Mobile IPv6 with Fast-handover, iv) Simultaneous Bindings, and v) Seamless handoff architecture for Mobile IP (S-MIP). We propose an evaluation model examining the effect of linear and ping-pong movement on handoff latency and TCP goodput, for all above frameworks. Our results show that S-MIP performs best under both ping-pong and linear movements during a handoff, with latency comparable to a layer-2 (access layer) handoff. All other frameworks suffer from packet losses and performance degradation of some sort. We also proposed an optimization for S-MIP which improves the performance by further eliminating the possibility of packets out of order, caused by the local packet forwarding mechanisms of S-MIP.

Characterizing achievable rates in multi-hop wireless networks: the joint routing and scheduling problem
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
This paper considers the problem of determining the achievable rates in multi-hop wireless networks. We consider the problem of jointly routing the flows and scheduling transmissions to achieve a given rate vector. We develop tight necessary and sufficient conditions for the achievability of the rate vector. We develop efficient and easy to implement Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes for solving the routing problem. The scheduling problem is a solved as a graph edge-coloring problem. We show that this approach guarantees that the solution obtained is within 67% of the optimal solution in the worst case and, in practice, is typically within about 80% of the optimal solution. The approach that we use is quite flexible and is a promising method to handle more sophisticated interference conditions, multiple channels, multiple antennas, and routing with diversity requirements.

Throughput capacity of random ad hoc networks with infrastructure support
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
In this paper, we consider the transport capacity of ad hoc networks with a random flat topology under the present support of an infinite capacity infrastructure network. Such a network architecture allows ad hoc nodes to communicate with each other by purely using the remaining ad hoc nodes as their relays. In addition, ad hoc nodes can also utilize the existing infrastructure fully or partially by reaching any access point (or gateway) of the infrastructure network in a single or multi-hop fashion. Using the same tools as in [1], we show that the per source node capacity of T(W/log(N)) can be achieved in a random network scenario with the following assumptions: (i) The number of ad hoc nodes per access point is bounded above, (ii) each wireless node, including the access points, is able to transmit at W bits/sec using a fixed transmission range, and (iii) N ad hoc nodes, excluding the access points, constitute a connected topology graph. This is a significant improvement over the capacity of random ad hoc networks with no infrastructure support which is found as T(W/vN log(N)) in [1]. Although better capacity figures may be obtained by complex network coding or exploiting mobility in the network, infrastructure approach provides a simpler mechanism that has more practical aspects. We also show that even when less stringent requirements are imposed on topology connectivity, a per source node capacity figure that is arbitrarily close to T(1) cannot be obtained. Nevertheless, under these weak conditions, we can further improve per node throughput significantly.

Impact of interference on multi-hop wireless network performance
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
In this paper, we address the following question: given a specific placement of wireless nodes in physical space and a specific traffic workload, what is the maximum throughput that can be supported by the resulting network? Unlike previous work that has focused on computing asymptotic performance bounds under assumptions of homogeneity or randomness in the network topology and/or workload, we work with any given network and workload specified as inputs.A key issue impacting performance is wireless interference between neighboring nodes. We model such interference using a conflict graph, and present methods for computing upper and lower bounds on the optimal throughput for the given network and workload. To compute these bounds, we assume that packet transmissions at the individual nodes can be finely controlled and carefully scheduled by an omniscient and omnipotent central entity, which is unrealistic. Nevertheless, using ns-2 simulations, we show that the routes derived from our analysis often yield noticeably better throughput than the default shortest path routes even in the presence of uncoordinated packet transmissions and MAC contention. This suggests that there is opportunity for achieving throughput gains by employing an interference-aware routing protocol.

Range-free localization schemes for large scale sensor networks
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
Wireless Sensor Networks have been proposed for a multitude of location-dependent applications. For such systems, the cost and limitations of the hardware on sensing nodes prevent the use of range-based localization schemes that depend on absolute point-to-point distance estimates. Because coarse accuracy is sufficient for most sensor network applications, solutions in range-free localization are being pursued as a cost-effective alternative to more expensive range-based approaches. In this paper, we present APIT, a novel localization algorithm that is range-free. We show that our APIT scheme performs best when an irregular radio pattern and random node placement are considered, and low communication overhead is desired. We compare our work via extensive simulation, with three state-of-the-art range-free localization schemes to identify the preferable system configurations of each. In addition, we study the effect of location error on routing and tracking performance. We show that routing performance and tracking accuracy are not significantly affected by localization error when the error is less than 0.4 times the communication radio radius.

Geographic routing without location information
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
For many years, scalable routing for wireless communication systems was a compelling but elusive goal. Recently, several routing algorithms that exploit geographic information (e.g. GPSR) have been proposed to achieve this goal. These algorithms refer to nodes by their location, not address, and use those coordinates to route greedily, when possible, towards the destination. However, there are many situations where location information is not available at the nodes, and so geographic methods cannot be used. In this paper we define a scalable coordinate-based routing algorithm that does not rely on location information, and thus can be used in a wide variety of ad hoc and sensornet environments.

Efficient location area planning for personal communication systems
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
A central problem in personal communication systems is to optimize bandwidth usage, while providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to mobile users. Network mobility management, and in particular, location management, consumes a significant portion of bandwidth, which is a necessary overhead for supporting mobile users. We focus our efforts on minimizing this overhead. Unlike previous works, we concentrate on optimizing existing schemes, and so the algorithms we present are easily incorporated into current networks. We present the first polynomial time approximation algorithms for minimum bandwidth location management. In planar graphs, our algorithm provably generates a solution that uses no more than a constant factor more bandwidth than the optimal solution. In general graphs, our algorithm provably generates a solution that uses just a factor O(logn) more bandwidth than optimal where n is the number of base stations in the network. We show that, in practice, our algorithm produces near-optimal results and outperforms other schemes that are described in the literature. For the important case of the line graph, we present a polynomial-time optimal algorithm. Finally, we illustrate that our algorithm can also be used for optimizing the handoff mechanism.

Minimum energy disjoint path routing in wireless ad-hoc networks
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
We develop algorithms for finding minimum energy disjoint paths in an all-wireless network, for both the node and link-disjoint cases. Our major results include a novel polynomial time algorithm that optimally solves the minimum energy 2 link-disjoint paths problem, as well as a polynomial time algorithm for the minimum energy k node-disjoint paths problem. In addition, we present efficient heuristic algorithms for both problems. Our results show that link-disjoint paths consume substantially less energy than node-disjoint paths. We also found that the incremental energy of additional link-disjoint paths is decreasing. This finding is somewhat surprising due to the fact that in general networks additional paths are typically longer than the shortest path. However, in a wireless network, additional paths can be obtained at lower energy due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. Finally, we discuss issues regarding distributed implementation and present distributed versions of the optimal centralized algorithms presented in the paper.

A high-throughput path metric for multi-hop wireless routing
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
This paper presents the expected transmission count metric (ETX), which finds high-throughput paths on multi-hop wireless networks. ETX minimizes the expected total number of packet transmissions (including retransmissions) required to successfully deliver a packet to the ultimate destination. The ETX metric incorporates the effects of link loss ratios, asymmetry in the loss ratios between the two directions of each link, and interference among the successive links of a path. In contrast, the minimum hop-count metric chooses arbitrarily among the different paths of the same minimum length, regardless of the often large differences in throughput among those paths, and ignoring the possibility that a longer path might offer higher throughput.This paper describes the design and implementation of ETX as a metric for the DSDV and DSR routing protocols, as well as modifications to DSDV and DSR which allow them to use ETX. Measurements taken from a 29-node 802.11b test-bed demonstrate the poor performance of minimum hop-count, illustrate the causes of that poor performance, and confirm that ETX improves performance. For long paths the throughput improvement is often a factor of two or more, suggesting that ETX will become more useful as networks grow larger and paths become longer.

Reactive routing overhead in networks with unreliable nodes
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
This paper presents a new mathematical and simulative framework for quantifying the overhead of a broad class of reactive routing protocols, such as DSR and AODV, in wireless variable topology (ad-hoc) networks. We focus on situations where the nodes are stationary but unreliable, as is common in the case of sensor networks. We explicitly model the application-level traffic in terms of the statistical description of the number of hops between a source and a destination. The sensor network is modelled by an unreliable regular Manhattan (i.e. degree four) grid, and expressions for various components of the routing overhead are derived. Results are compared against ns-2 simulations for regular and random topologies, which corroborate the essential characteristics of the analytical results. One of the key insights that can be drawn from the mathematical results of this paper is that it is possible to design infinitely scalable reactive routing protocols for variable topology networks by judicious engineering of the traffic patterns to satisfy the conditions presented in this paper.

MiSer: an optimal low-energy transmission strategy for IEEE 802.11a/h
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
Reducing the energy consumption by wireless communication devices is perhaps the most important issue in the widely-deployed and exponentially-growing IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs (WLANs). TPC (Transmit Power Control) and PHY (physical layer) rate adaptation have been recognized as two most effective ways to achieve this goal. The emerging 802.11h standard, which is an extension to the current 802.11 MAC and the high-speed 802.11a PHY, will provide a structured means to support intelligent TPC.In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called MiSer, that minimizes the communication energy consumption in 802.11a/h systems by combining TPC with PHY rate adaptation. The key idea is to compute offline an optimal rate-power combination table, and then at runtime, a wireless station determines the most energy-efficient transmission strategy for each data frame by a simple table lookup. Another key contribution of this paper is to provide a rigorous analysis of the relation among different radio ranges and TPC's effect on the interference in 802.11a/h systems, which justifies MiSer's approach to ameliorating the TPC-caused interference by transmitting the CTS frames at a stronger power level. Our simulation results show that MiSer delivers about 20% more data per unit of energy consumption than the PHY rate adaptation scheme without TPC, while outperforming single-rate TPC schemes significantly thanks to the excellent energy-saving capability of PHY rate adaptation.

Self-tuning wireless network power management
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
Current wireless network power management often substantially degrades performance and may even increase overall energy usage when used with latency-sensitive applications. We propose self-tuning power management (STPM) that adapts its behavior to the access patterns and intent of applications, the characteristics of the network interface, and the energy usage of the platform. We have implemented STPM as a Linux kernel module---our results show substantial benefits for distributed file systems, streaming audio, and thin-client applications. Compared to default 802.11b power management, STPM reduces the total energy usage of an iPAQ running the Coda distributed file system by 21% while also reducing interactive file system delay by 80%. Further, STPM adapts to diverse operating conditions: it yields good results on both laptops and handhelds, supports 802.11b network interfaces with substantially different characteristics, and performs well across a range of application network access patterns.

Improving protocol capacity with model-based frame scheduling in IEEE 802.11-operated WLANs
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
In this paper, we develop a model-based frame scheduling scheme, called MFS, to enhance the capacity of IEEE 802.11-operated wireless LANs (WLANs). In MFS each node estimates the current network status by keeping track of the number of collisions it encounters between its two consecutive successful frame transmissions, and, based on the the estimated information, computes the current network utilization. The result is then used to determine a scheduling delay that is introduced (with the objective of avoiding collision) before a node attempts for transmission of its pending frame. In order to accurately calculate the current utilization in WLANs, we develop an analytical model that characterizes data transmission activities in IEEE 802.11-operated WLANs with/without the RTS/CTS mechanism, and validate the model with ns-2 simulation. All the control overhead incurred in the physical and MAC layers, as well as system parameters specified in IEEE 802.11 are figured in.We have conducted a comprehensive simulation study to evaluate MFS in perspective of number of collisions, achievable throughput, and inter-transmission delay. The simulation results indicate that the performance improvement with respect to protocol capacity can be as high as 20% with RTS/CTS and 150% without RTS/CTS, in a WLAN of up to 300 nodes. In addition, the inter-transmission delay in MFS is smaller and exhibits less variation than that in IEEE 802.11.

Sound mobility models
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
Simulation has become an indispensable tool in the construction and evaluation of mobile systems. By using mobility models that describe constituent movement, one can explore large systems, producing repeatable results for comparison between alternatives. Unfortunately, the vast majority of mobility models---including all those in which nodal speed and distance or destination are chosen independently---suffer from decay; average speed decreases until converging to some long-term average. Such decay provides an unsound basis for simulation studies that collect results averaged over time, complicating the experimental process.This paper shows via analysis that such decay is inevitable in a wide variety of mobility models, including the most common in use today. We derive a general framework for describing this decay, and apply it to a number of practical cases. Furthermore, this framework allows us to transform any given mobility model into a stationary one: choose initial speeds from the steady-state distribution, and subsequent speeds from the original. This transformation provides sound models for simulation, eliminating variations in average nodal speed.

Towards realistic mobility models for mobile ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
One of the most important methods for evaluating the characteristics of ad hoc networking protocols is through the use of simulation. Simulation provides researchers with a number of significant benefits, including repeatable scenarios, isolation of parameters, and exploration of a variety of metrics. The topology and movement of the nodes in the simulation are key factors in the performance of the network protocol under study. Once the nodes have been initially distributed, the mobility model dictates the movement of the nodes within the network. Because the mobility of the nodes directly impacts the performance of the protocols, simulation results obtained with unrealistic movement models may not correctly reflect the true performance of the protocols. The majority of existing mobility models for ad hoc networks do not provide realistic movement scenarios; they are limited to random walk models without any obstacles. In this paper, we propose to create more realistic movement models through the incorporation of obstacles. These obstacles are utilized to both restrict node movement as well as wireless transmissions. In addition to the inclusion of obstacles, we construct movement paths using the Voronoi diagram of obstacle vertices. Nodes can then be randomly distributed across the paths, and can use shortest path route computations to destinations at randomly chosen obstacles. Simulation results show that the use of obstacles and pathways has a significant impact on the performance of ad hoc network protocols.

DIRAC: a software-based wireless router system
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
Routers are expected to play an important role in the IP-based wireless data network. Although a substantial number of techniques have been proposed to improve wireless network performance under dynamic wireless channel conditions and host mobility, a system support framework is still missing. In this paper, we describe DIRAC, a software-based router system that is designed for wireless networks to facilitate the implementation and evaluation of various channel-adaptive and mobility-aware protocols. DIRAC adopts a distributed architecture that is composed of two parts: a Router Core (RC) shared by the wireless subnets, and a Router Agent (RA) at each access point/base station. RAs expose wireless link-layer information to the RC and enforce the control commands issued by the RC. This approach allows the router to make adaptive decisions based on link-layer information feedback. It also permits the router to enforce its policies (e.g., policing) more effectively through underlying link-layer mechanisms. As showcases, we implement under DIRAC the prototypes of three wireless network services: link-layer assisted fast handover, channel-adaptive scheduling, and link-layer enforced policing. Our implementation and experiments show that our distributed wireless router provides a flexible framework, which enables advanced network-layer wireless services that are adaptive to channel conditions and host mobility.

Ad hoc-VCG: a truthful and cost-efficient routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks with selfish agents
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
We introduce a game-theoretic setting for routing in a mobile ad hoc network that consists of greedy, selfish agents who accept payments for forwarding data for other agents if the payments cover their individual costs incurred by forwarding data. In this setting, we propose Ad hoc-VCG, a reactive routing protocol that achieves the design objectives of truthfulness (i.e., it is in the agents' best interest to reveal their true costs for forwarding data) and cost-efficiency (i.e., it guarantees that routing is done along the most cost-efficient path) in a game-theoretic sense by paying to the intermediate nodes a premium over their actual costs for forwarding data packets. We show that the total overpayment (i.e., the sum of all premiums paid) is relatively small by giving a theoretical upper bound and by providing experimental evidence. Our routing protocol implements a variation of the well-known mechanism by Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves in a mobile network setting. Finally, we analyze a very natural routing protocol that is an adaptation of the Packet Purse Model [8] with auctions in our setting and show that, unfortunately, it does not achieve cost-efficiency or truthfulness.

Trajectory based forwarding and its applications
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
Trajectory based forwarding (TBF) is a novel methodto forward packets in a dense ad hoc network that makes it possible to route a packet along a predefined curve. It is a hybrid between source based routing and Cartesian forwarding in that the trajectory is set by the source, but the forwarding decision is based on the relationship to the trajectory rather than names of intermediate nodes. The fundamental aspects of TBF are: it decouples path naming from the actual path; it provides cheap path diversity; it trades off communication for computation. These aspects address the double scalability issue with respect to mobility rate and network size. In addition, TBF provides a common framework for many services such as: broadcasting, discovery, unicast, multicast and multipath routing in ad hoc networks. TBF requires that nodes know their position relative to a coordinate system. While a global coordinate system afforded by a system such as GPS would be ideal, approximate positioning methods provided by other algorithms are also usable.

Manycast: exploring the space between anycast and multicast in ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
The characteristics of ad hoc networks naturally encourage the deployment of distributed services. Although current networks implement group communication methods, they do not support the needs of a mobile node that must locate one or more distributed servers. A node should not need detailed knowledge of network topology to choose servers with which it can communicate efficiently.To this end, manycast is a group communication scheme that enables communication with an arbitrary (user specified) number of group members. Anycast and multicast communication are special cases of manycast in which the target number of group members is one and infinity, respectively. We present manycast and discuss its use as a communication primitive, with specific attention to ad hoc networks. We advocate manycast support at the network layer. A manycast routing protocol enables an application to contact several nearby network nodes that implement a distributed service.We analyze some approaches to manycast, including some application layer implementations. This evaluation supports our claim that manycast must be implemented in the network layer for effective operation in ad hoc networks. We present several extensions to ad hoc routing protocols that can provide manycast support with minimal implementation effort. Through analysis and extensive simulation, we explore the behavior of these approaches to manycast, finally providing recommendations to implementors.

Topology control for wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
We consider a two-tiered Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consisting of sensor clusters deployed around strategic locations and base-stations (BSs) whose locations are relatively flexible. Within a sensor cluster, there are many small sensor nodes (SNs) that capture, encode and transmit relevant information from the designated area, and there is at least one application node (AN) that receives raw data from these SNs, creates a comprehensive local-view, and forwards the composite bit-stream toward a BS. In practice, both SN and AN are battery-powered and energy-constrained, and their node lifetimes directly affect the network lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we focus on the topology control process for ANs and BSs, which constitute the upper tier of a two-tiered WSN. We propose approaches to maximize the topological network lifetime of the WSN, by arranging BS location and inter-AN relaying optimally. Based on an algorithm in Computational Geometry, we derive the optimal BS locations under three topological lifetime definitions according to mission criticality. In addition, by studying the intrinsic properties of WSNs, we establish the upper and lower bounds of their maximal topological lifetime. When inter-AN relaying becomes feasible and favorable, we continue to develop an optimal parallel relay allocation to further prolong the topological lifetime of the WSN. An equivalent serialized relay schedule is also obtained, so that each AN only needs to have one relay destination at any time throughout the mission. The experimental performance evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of topology control as a vital process to maximize the network lifetime of WSNs.

Power optimization in fault-tolerant topology control algorithms for wireless multi-hop networks
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
In ad hoc wireless networks, it is crucial to minimize power consumption while maintaining key network properties. This work studies power assignments of wireless devices that minimize power while maintaining k-fault tolerance. Specifically, we require all links established by this power setting be symmetric and form a k-vertex connected subgraph of the network graph. This problem is known to be NP-hard. We show current heuristic approaches can use arbitrarily more power than the optimal solution. Hence, we seek approximation algorithms for this problem. We present three approximation algorithms. The first algorithm gives an O(ka) approximation where a is the best approximation factor for the related problem in wired networks (the best a so far is in O(log k).) Then, using a more complicated algorithm and careful analysis, we achieve O(k) approximation for general graphs. We then present simple and practical distributed approximation algorithms for the cases of 2- and 3-connectivity in geometric graphs. In addition, we demonstrate how we can generalize this algorithm for k-connectivity in geometric graphs. Finally, we show that these approximation algorithms compare favorably with existing heuristics. We note that all algorithms presented in this paper can be used to minimize power while maintaining k-edge connectivity with guaranteed approximation factors.

Distributed algorithms for guiding navigation across a sensor network

None
2003
We develop distributed algorithms for self-organizing sensor networks that respond to directing a target through a region. The sensor network models the danger levels sensed across its area and has the ability to adapt to changes. It represents the dangerous areas as obstacles. A protocol that combines the artificial potential field of the sensors with the goal location for the moving object guides the object incrementally across the network to the goal, while maintaining the safest distance to the danger areas. We give the analysis to the protocol and report on hardware experiments using a physical sensor network consisting of Mote sensors.

ARC: an integrated admission and rate control framework for CDMA data networks based on non-cooperative games
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
The competition among wireless data service providers brings in an option for the customers to switch their providers, due to unsatisfactory service or otherwise. However, the existing resource management algorithms for wireless networks fail to fully capture the far-reaching impact of this competitiveness. From this perspective, we propose an integrated admission and rate control (ARC) framework for CDMA based wireless data networks. The admission control is at the session (macro) level while the rate control is at the link layer packet (micro) level. The ARC framework is based on a novel game theoretic formulation which defines non-cooperative games between the service providers and the customers. A user's decision to leave or join a provider is based on a finite set of strategies. A service provider can also construct its game strategy set so as to maximize the utility (revenue) yet attaining its target churn rate (the probability of users leaving the network). We show that the pure strategy Nash equilibrium can be established for both under-loaded and fully-loaded systems such that the providers have clearly defined admission criteria as outcome from this game. Users are categorized into multiple classes and offered differentiated services based on the price they pay and the service degradation they can tolerate. We show that the proposed ARC framework significantly increases the provider's revenue and also successfully offers differentiated QoS to the users.

Wireless downlink data channels: user performance and cell dimensioning
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
We consider wireless downlink data channels where the transmission power of each base station is time-shared between a dynamic number of active users as in CDMA/HDR systems. We derive analytical results relating user performance, in terms of blocking probability and data throughput, to cell size and traffic density. These results are used to address a number of practically interesting issues, including the trade-off between cell coverage and cell capacity and the choice of efficient scheduling and admission control schemes.

UCAN: a unified cellular and ad-hoc network architecture
Proceedings of the 9th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2003
In third-generation (3G) wireless data networks, mobile users experiencing poor channel quality usually have low data-rate connections with the base-station. Providing service to low data-rate users is required for maintaining fairness, but at the cost of reducing the cell's aggregate throughput. In this paper, we propose the Unified Cellular and Ad-Hoc Network (UCAN) architecture for enhancing cell throughput, while maintaining fairness. In UCAN, a mobile client has both 3G cellular link and IEEE 802.11-based peer-to-peer links. The 3G base station forwards packets for destination clients with poor channel quality to proxy clients with better channel quality. The proxy clients then use an ad-hoc network composed of other mobile clients and IEEE 802.11 wireless links to forward the packets to the appropriate destinations, thereby improving cell throughput. We refine the 3G base station scheduling algorithm so that the throughput gains of active clients are distributed proportional to their average channel rate, thereby maintaining fairness. With the UCAN architecture in place, we propose novel greedy and on-demand protocols for proxy discovery and ad-hoc routing that explicitly leverage the existence of the 3G infrastructure to reduce complexity and improve reliability. We further propose a secure crediting mechanism to motivate users to participate in relaying packets for others. Through extensive simulations with HDR and IEEE 802.11b, we show that the UCAN architecture can improve individual user's throughput by up to 310% and the aggregate throughput of the HDR downlink by up to 60%.

Using code collection to support large applications on mobile devices
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
The progress of mobile device technology unfolds a new spectrum of applications that challenges conventional infrastructure models. Most of these devices are perceived by their users as "appliances" rather than computers and accordingly the application management should be done transparently by the underlying system unlike classic applications managed explicitly by the user. Memory management on such devices should consider new types of mobile applications involving code mobility such as mobile agents, active networks and context aware applications. This paper describes a new code management technique, called "code collection" and proposes a specific code collection algorithm, the Adaptive Code Collection Algorithm (ACCAL). Code collection is a mechanism for transparently loading and discarding application components on mobile devices at runtime that is designed to permit very low memory usage and at the same time good performance by focusing memory usage on the hotspots of the application. To achieve these goals, ACCAL uses properties specific to executable code and enhances conventional data management methods such as garbage collection and caching. The results show that fine-grained code collection allows large applications to execute by using significantly less memory while inducing small execution time overhead.

Architecture and techniques for diagnosing faults in IEEE 802.11 infrastructure networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
The wide-scale deployment of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks has generated significant challenges for Information Technology (IT) departments in corporations. Users frequently complain about connectivity and performance problems, and network administrators are expected to diagnose these problems while managing corporate security and coverage. Their task is particularly difficult due to the unreliable nature of the wireless medium and a lack of intelligent diagnostic tools for determining the cause of these problems.This paper presents an architecture for detecting and diagnosing faults in IEEE 802.11 infrastructure wireless networks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to address fault diagnostic issues for these networks. As part of our architecture, we propose and evaluate a novel technique called Client Conduit, which enables boot-strapping and fault diagnosis of disconnected clients. We describe techniques for analyzing performance problems faced in a wireless LAN deployment. We also present an approach for detecting unauthorized access points. We have built a prototype of our fault diagnostic architecture on the Windows operating system using off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11 cards. The initial results show that our mechanisms are effective; furthermore, they impose low overheads when clients are not experiencing problems.

Localization for mobile sensor networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Many sensor network applications require location awareness, but it is often too expensive to include a GPS receiver in a sensor network node. Hence, localization schemes for sensor networks typically use a small number of seed nodes that know their location and protocols whereby other nodes estimate their location from the messages they receive. Several such localization techniques have been proposed, but none of them consider mobile nodes and seeds. Although mobility would appear to make localization more difficult, in this paper we introduce the sequential Monte Carlo Localization method and argue that it can exploit mobility to improve the accuracy and precision of localization. Our approach does not require additional hardware on the nodes and works even when the movement of seeds and nodes is uncontrollable. We analyze the properties of our technique and report experimental results from simulations. Our scheme outperforms the best known static localization schemes under a wide range of conditions.

VOR base stations for indoor 802.11 positioning
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Angle of arrival (AOA) has previously been used for outdoor positioning in aircraft navigation and for services like E911. For indoor positioning, the best schemes to date rely either on extensive infrastructure, or on sampling of the signal strength on a dense grid, which is subject to changes in the environment, like furniture, elevators, or people. We present an indoor positioning architecture that does not require a signal strength map, simply requiring the placement of special VOR base stations (VORBA). While our incipient realization of the AOA using 802.11 uses a base station with a revolving directional antenna, a non mechanical implementation would yield comparable performance, even with quantized angles. Performance of positioning with VOR base stations is evaluated though experimentation, simulation, and theoretical analysis.

Practical robust localization over large-scale 802.11 wireless networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
We demonstrate a system built using probabilistic techniques that allows for remarkably accurate localization across our entire office building using nothing more than the built-in signal intensity meter supplied by standard 802.11 cards. While prior systems have required significant investments of human labor to build a detailed signal map, we can train our system by spending less than one minute per office or region, walking around with a laptop and recording the observed signal intensities of our building's unmodified base stations. We actually collected over two minutes of data per office or region, about 28 man-hours of effort. Using less than half of this data to train the localizer, we can localize a user to the precise, correct location in over 95% of our attempts, across the entire building. Even in the most pathological cases, we almost never localize a user any more distant than to the neighboring office. A user can obtain this level of accuracy with only two or three signal intensity measurements, allowing for a high frame rate of localization results. Furthermore, with a brief calibration period, our system can be adapted to work with previously unknown user hardware. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our system against a variety of untrained time-varying phenomena, including the presence or absence of people in the building across the day. Our system is sufficiently robust to enable a variety of location-aware applications without requiring special-purpose hardware or complicated training and calibration procedures.

Revisiting the TTL-based controlled flooding search: optimality and randomization
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
In this paper we consider the problem of searching for a node or an object (i.e., piece of data, file, etc.) in a large network. Applications of this problem include searching for a destination node in a mobile ad hoc network, querying for a piece of desired data in a wireless sensor network, and searching for a shared file in an unstructured peer-to-peer network. We limit our attention in this study to the class of controlled flooding search strategies where query/search packets are broadcast and propagated in the network until a preset TTL (time-to-live) value carried in the packet expires. Every unsuccessful search attempt results in an increased TTL value (i.e., larger search area) and the same process is repeated. The primary goal of this study is to derive search strategies (i.e., sequences of TTL values) that will minimize the cost of such searches associated with packet transmissions. The main results of this paper are as follows. When the probability distribution of the location of the object is known a priori, we present a dynamic programming formulation with which optimal search strategies can be derived that minimize the expected search cost. We also derive the necessary and sufficient conditions %on the location distribution for two very commonly used search strategies to be optimal. When the probability distribution of the location of the object is not known a priori and the object is to minimize the worst-case search cost, we show that the best strategies are randomized strategies, i.e., successive TTL values are chosen from certain probability distributions rather than deterministic values. We show that given any deterministic TTL sequence, there exists a randomized version that has a lower worst-case expected search cost. We also derive an asymptotically (as the network size increases) optimal strategy within a class of randomized strategies.

Network deformation: traffic-aware algorithms for dynamically reducing end-to-end delay in multi-hop wireless networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
We present two centralized algorithms that dynamically deform the topology of a multi-hop wireless network in response to changing traffic conditions, so as to reduce the end-to-end packet delay. These algorithms operate by reducing an easily calculable traffic-and-topology-dependent metric that has strong positive correlation to the mean end-to-end network delay. This makes it possible to change the network topology in real time. The first algorithm involves moving existing nodes to create new links, while the second involves adding a new node to the existing network. The new links are added judiciously between nodes with the most traffic fluctuations, in a way that often decreases the total number of network links. Multiple simulations on the original and the deformed networks using the \ns simulator demonstrate that the reductions in end-to-end delay are significantly higher than with the alternative approach of increasing the capacities of the most congested links.

Routing in multi-radio, multi-hop wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
We present a new metric for routing in multi-radio, multi-hop wireless networks. We focus on wireless networks with stationary nodes, such as community wireless networks.The goal of the metric is to choose a high-throughput path between a source and a destination. Our metric assigns weights to individual links based on the Expected Transmission Time (ETT) of a packet over the link. The ETT is a function of the loss rate and the bandwidth of the link. The individual link weights are combined into a path metric called Weighted Cumulative ETT (WCETT) that explicitly accounts for the interference among links that use the same channel. The WCETT metric is incorporated into a routing protocol that we call Multi-Radio Link-Quality Source Routing.We studied the performance of our metric by implementing it in a wireless testbed consisting of 23 nodes, each equipped with two 802.11 wireless cards. We find that in a multi-radio environment, our metric significantly outperforms previously-proposed routing metrics by making judicious use of the second radio.

Power conservation and quality of surveillance in target tracking sensor networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Target tracking is an important application of wireless sensor networks. In this application, the sensor nodes collectively monitor and track the movement of an event or target object. The network operations have two states: the surveillance state during the absence of any event of interest, and the tracking state which is in response to any moving targets. Thus, the power saving operations, which is of critical importance for extending network lifetime, should be operative in two different modes as well. In this paper, we study the power saving operations in both states of network operations. During surveillance state, a set of novel metrics for quality of surveillance is proposed specifically for detecting moving objects. In the tracking state, we propose a collaborative messaging scheme that wakes up and shuts down the sensor nodes with spatial and temporal preciseness. This study, which is a combination of theoretical analysis and simulated evaluations, quantifies the trade-off between power conservation and quality of surveillance while presenting guidelines for efficient deployment of sensor nodes for target tracking application.

On k-coverage in a mostly sleeping sensor network
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Sensor networks are often desired to last many times longer than the active lifetime of individual sensors. This is usually achieved by putting sensors to sleep for most of their lifetime. On the other hand, surveillance kind of applications require guaranteed k-coverage of the protected region at all times. As a result, determining the appropriate number of sensors to deploy that achieves both goals simultaneously becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we consider three kinds of deployments for a sensor network on a unit square - a &#8730;n x &#8730;n grid, random uniform (for all n points), and Poisson (with density n). In all three deployments, each sensor is active with probability p, independently from the others. Then, we claim that the critical value of the function np&#960;r2/log(np) is 1 for the event of k-coverage of every point. We also provide an upper bound on the window of this phase transition. Although the conditions for the three deployments are similar, we obtain sharper bounds for the random deployments than the grid deployment, which occurs due to the boundary condition. In this paper, we also provide corrections to previously published results for the grid deployment model. Finally, we use simulation to show the usefulness of our analysis in real deployment scenarios.

Performance optimizations for wireless wide-area networks: comparative study and experimental evaluation
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
We present a comparative performance study of a wide selection of optimization techniques to enhance application performance in the context of wide-area wireless networks (WWANs). Unlike in traditional wired and wireless IP-based networks, applications running over WWAN cellular environments are significantly affected by the vagaries of the cellular wireless medium. Prior research has proposed and analyzed optimizations at individual layers of the protocol stack. In contrast, we introduce the first detailed experiment-based evaluation and comparison of all such optimization techniques in a commercial WWAN testbed. This paper, therefore, summarizes our experience in implementing and deploying an infrastructure to improve WWAN performance.The goals of this paper are: (1) to perform an accurate benchmark of application performance over such commercially deployed WWAN environments, (2) to implement and characterize the impact of various optimization techniques across different layers of the protocol stack, and (3) to quantify their interdependencies in realistic scenarios. Additionally, we also discuss measurement pitfalls that we experienced and provide guidelines that may be useful for future experimentation in WWAN environments.

Characterizing flows in large wireless data networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Several studies have recently been performed on wireless university campus networks, corporate and public networks. Yet little is known about the flow-level characterization in such networks. In this paper, we statistically characterize both static flows and roaming flows in a large campus wireless network using a recently-collected trace. For static flows, we take a two-tier approach to characterizing the flow arrivals, which results a Weibull regression model. We further discover that the static flow arrivals in spatial proximity show strong similarity. As for roaming flows, they can also be well characterized statistically.We explain the results by user behaviors and application demands, and further cross-validate the modeling results by three other traces. Finally, we use two examples to illustrate how to apply our models for performance evaluation in the wireless context.

The changing usage of a mature campus-wide wireless network
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) are now commonplace on many academic and corporate campuses. As "Wi-Fi" technology becomes ubiquitous, it is increasingly important to understand trends in the usage of these networks.This paper analyzes an extensive network trace from a mature 802.11 WLAN, including more than 550 access points and 7000 users over seventeen weeks. We employ several measurement techniques, including syslogs, telephone records, SNMP polling and tcpdump packet sniffing. This is the largest WLAN study to date, and the first to look at a large, mature WLAN and consider geographic mobility. We compare this trace to a trace taken after the network's initial deployment two years ago.We found that the applications used on the WLAN changed dramatically. Initial WLAN usage was dominated by Web traffic; our new trace shows significant increases in peer-to-peer, streaming multimedia, and voice over IP (VoIP) traffic. On-campus traffic now exceeds off-campus traffic, a reversal of the situation at the WLAN's initial deployment. Our study indicates that VoIP has been used little on the wireless network thus far, and most VoIP calls are made on the wired network. Most calls last less than a minute.We saw greater heterogeneity in the types of clients used, with more embedded wireless devices such as PDAs and mobile VoIP clients. We define a new metric for mobility, the "session diameter." We use this metric to show that embedded devices have different mobility characteristics than laptops, and travel further and roam to more access points. Overall, users were surprisingly non-mobile, with half remaining close to home about 98% of the time.

Denial of service resilience in ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Significant progress has been made towards making ad hoc networks secure and DoS resilient. However, little attention has been focused on quantifying DoS resilience: Do ad hoc networks have sufficiently redundant paths and counter-DoS mechanisms to make DoS attacks largely ineffective? Or are there attack and system factors that can lead to devastating effects? In this paper, we design and study DoS attacks in order to assess the damage that difficult-to-detect attackers can cause. The first attack we study, called the JellyFish attack, is targeted against closed-loop flows such as TCP; although protocol compliant, it has devastating effects. The second is the Black Hole attack, which has effects similar to the JellyFish, but on open-loop flows. We quantify via simulations and analytical modeling the scalability of DoS attacks as a function of key performance parameters such as mobility, system size, node density, and counter-DoS strategy. One perhaps surprising result is that such DoS attacks can increase the capacity of ad hoc networks, as they starve multi-hop flows and only allow one-hop communication, a capacity-maximizing, yet clearly undesirable situation.

SSCH: slotted seeded channel hopping for capacity improvement in IEEE 802.11 ad-hoc wireless networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Capacity improvement is one of the principal challenges in wireless networking. We present a link-layer protocol called Slotted Seeded Channel Hopping, or SSCH, that increases the capacity of an IEEE 802.11 network by utilizing frequency diversity. SSCH can be implemented in software over an IEEE 802.11-compliant wireless card. Each node using SSCH switches across channels in such a manner that nodes desiring to communicate overlap, while disjoint communications mostly do not overlap, and hence do not interfere with each other. To achieve this, SSCH uses a novel scheme for distributed rendezvous and synchronization. Simulation results show that SSCH significantly increases network capacity in several multi-hop and single-hop wireless networking scenarios.

Improving TCP performance over mobile ad hoc networks by exploiting cross-layer information awareness
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
TCP performance degrades significantly in mobile ad hoc networks because most of packet losses occur as a result of route failures. Prior work proposed to provide link failure feedback to TCP so that TCP can avoid responding to route failures as if congestion had occurred. However, after a link failure is detected, several packets will be dropped from the network interface queue; TCP will time out because of these losses. It will also time out for ACK losses caused by route failures. In this paper, we propose to make routing protocols aware of lost data packets and ACKs and help reduce TCP timeouts for mobility-induced losses. Toward this end, we present two mechanisms: early packet loss notification (EPLN) and best-effort ACK delivery (BEAD). EPLN seeks to notify TCP senders about lost data packets. For lost ACKs, BEAD attempts to retransmit ACKs at either intermediate nodes or TCP receivers. Both mechanisms extensively use cached routes, without initiating route discoveries at any intermediate node. We evaluate TCP-ELFN enhanced with the two mechanisms using two caching strategies for DSR, path caches and a distributed cache update algorithm proposed in our prior work. We show that TCP-ELFN with EPLN and BEAD significantly outperforms TCP-ELFN under both caching strategies. We conclude that cross-layer information awareness is key to making TCP efficient in the presence of mobility.

Truthful multicast routing in selfish wireless networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
In wireless networks, it is often assumed that each individual wireless terminal will faithfully follow the prescribed protocols without any deviation-- except, perhaps, for a few faulty or malicious ones. Wireless terminals, when owned by individual users, will likely do what is the most beneficial to their owners, i.e., act "selfishly". Therefore, an algorithm or protocol intended for selfish wireless networks must be designed.In this paper, we specifically study how to conduct efficient multicast routing in selfish wireless networks. We assume that each wireless terminal or communication link will incur a cost when it transits some data. Traditionally, the VCG mechanism has been the only method to design protocols so that each selfish agent will follow the protocols for its own interest to maximize its benefit. The main contributions of this paper are two-folds. First, for each of the widely used multicast structures, we show that the VCG based mechanism does not guarantee that the selfish terminals will follow the protocol. Second, we design the first multicast protocols without using VCG mechanism such that each agent maximizes its profit when it truthfully reports its cost.Extensive simulations are conducted to study the practical performances of the proposed protocols regarding the actual network cost and total payment.

Initializing newly deployed ad hoc and sensor networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
A newly deployed multi-hop radio network is unstructured and lacks a reliable and efficient communication scheme. In this paper, we take a step towards analyzing the problems existing during the initialization phase of ad hoc and sensor networks. Particularly, we model the network as a multi-hop quasi unit disk graph and allow nodes to wake up asynchronously at any time. Further, nodes do not feature a reliable collision detection mechanism, and they have only limited knowledge about the network topology. We show that even for this restricted model, a good clustering can be computed efficiently. Our algorithm efficiently computes an asymptotically optimal clustering. Based on this algorithm, we describe a protocol for quickly establishing synchronized sleep and listen schedule between nodes within a cluster. Additionally, we provide simulation results in a variety of settings.

FLSS: a fault-tolerant topology control algorithm for wireless networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Topology control algorithms usually reduce the number of links in a wireless network, which in turn decreases the degree of connectivity. The resulting network topology is more susceptible to system faults such as node failures and departures. In this paper, we consider k-vertex connectivity of a wireless network. We first present a centralized algorithm, Fault-tolerant Global Spanning Subgraph (FGSSk), which preserves k-vertex connectivity. FGSSk is min-max optimal, i.e., FGSSk minimizes the maximum transmission power used in the network, among all algorithms that preserve k-vertex connectivity. Based on FGSSk, we propose a localized algorithm, Fault-tolerant Local Spanning Subgraph (FLSSk). It is proved that FLSSk preserves k-vertex connectivity while maintaining bi-directionality of the network, and FLSSk is min-max optimal among all strictly localized algorithms. We then relax several widely used assumptions for topology control to enhance the practicality of FGSSk and FLSSk. Simulation results show that FLSSk is more power-efficient than other existing distributed/localized topology control algorithms.

End-to-end performance and fairness in multihop wireless backhaul networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Wireless IEEE 802.11 networks in residences, small businesses, and public "hot spots" typically encounter the wireline access link (DSL, cable modem, T1, etc.) as the slowest and most expensive part of the end-to-end path. Consequently, network architectures have been proposed that employ multiple wireless hops in route to and from the wired Internet. Unfortunately, use of current media access and transport protocols for such systems can result in severe unfairness and even starvation for flows that are an increasing number of hops away from a wired Internet entry point. Our objective is to study fairness and end-to-end performance in multihop wireless backhaul networks via the following methodology. First, we develop a formal reference model that characterizes objectives such as removing spatial bias (i.e., providing performance that is independent of the number of wireless hops to a wire) and maximizing spatial reuse. Second, we perform an extensive set of simulation experiments to quantify the impact of the key performance factors towards achieving these goals. For example, we study the roles of the MAC protocol, end-to-end congestion control, antenna technology, and traffic types. Next, we develop and study a distributed layer 2 fairness algorithm which targets to achieve the fairness of the reference model without modification to TCP. Finally, we study the critical relationship between fairness and aggregate throughput and in particular study the fairness-constrained system capacity of multihop wireless backhaul networks.

Coordinated load balancing, handoff/cell-site selection, and scheduling in multi-cell packet data systems
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
We investigate a wireless system of multiple cells, each having a downlink shared channel in support of high-speed packet data services. In practice, such a system consists of hierarchically organized entities including a central server, Base Stations (BSs), and Mobile Stations (MSs). Our goal is to improve global resource utilization and reduce regional congestion given asymmetric arrivals and departures of mobile users. For this purpose, we propose a scalable cross-layer framework to coordinate packet-level scheduling, call-level cell-site selection and handoff, and system-level loading balancing based on load, throughput, and channel measurements at different layers. In this framework, an opportunistic scheduling algorithm---the weighted Alpha-Rule---exploits multiuser diversity gain in each cell independently, trading aggregate (mean) downlink throughput for fairness and minimum rate guarantees among MSs. Each MS adapts to its channel dynamics and the load fluctuations in neighboring cells, in accordance with MSs' mobility and their arrivals or departures, by initiating load-aware handoff and cell-site selection. The central server adjusts the scheduling parameters of each cell to coordinate cells' coverage, or cell breathing, by prompting distributed MS handoffs. Across the whole system, BSs and MSs constantly monitor their load, throughput, or channel quality in order to facilitate the overall system coordination.Our specific contributions in such a framework are highlighted by the minimum-rate guaranteed Weighted Alpha-Rule scheduling, the load-aware MS handoff/cell-site selection, and the Media Access Control (MAC)-layer cell breathing. Our evaluations show that the proposed framework can improve the global resource utilization and load balancing, which translates into a smaller blocking rate of MS arrivals without extra resources, while the aggregate throughput remains roughly the same or improved around the hot-spots. Our tests also show that the coordinated system is robust to dynamic load fluctuations and is scalable to both system size and MS population.

Fairness and load balancing in wireless LANs using association control
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Recent studies on operational wireless LANs (WLANs) have shown that user load is often unevenly distributed among wireless access points (APs). This unbalanced load results in unfair bandwidth allocation among users. We observe that the unbalanced load and unfair bandwidth allocation can be greatly alleviated by intelligently associating users to APs, termed association control, rather than having users greedily associate APs of best received signal strength.In this study, we present an efficient algorithmic solution to determine the user-AP associations that ensure max-min fair bandwidth allocation. We provide a rigorous formulation of the association control problem that considers bandwidth constraints of both the wireless and backhaul links. Our formulation indicates the strong correlation between fairness and load balancing, which enables us to use load balancing techniques for obtaining near optimal max-min fair bandwidth allocation. Since this problem is NP-hard, we present algorithms that achieve a constant-factor approximate max-min fair bandwidth allocation. First, we calculate a fractional load balancing solution, where users can be associated with multiple APs simultaneously. This solution guarantees the fairest bandwidth allocation in terms of max-min fairness. Then, by utilizing a rounding method we obtain an efficient integral association. In particular, we provide a 2-approximation algorithm for unweighted greedy users and a 3-approximation algorithm for weighted and bounded-demand users. In addition to bandwidth fairness, we also consider time fairness and we show it can be solved optimally. We further extend our schemes for the on-line case where users may join and leave. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve close to optimal load balancing and max-min fairness and they outperform commonly used heuristic approaches.

A scalable model for channel access protocols in multihop ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
A new modeling framework is introduced for the analytical study of medium access control (MAC) protocols operating in multihop ad hoc networks. The model takes into account the effect of physical-layer parameters on the success of transmissions, the MAC protocol on the likelihood that nodes can access the channnel, and the connectivity of nodes in the network. A key feature of the model is that nodes can be modeled individually, i.e., it allows a per-node setup of many layer-specific parameters. Moreover, no spatial probability distribution or a particular arrangement of nodes is assumed; the model allows the computation of individual (per-node) performance metrics for any given network topology and radio channel model. To show the applicability of the modeling framework, we model multihop ad hoc networks using the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function and validate the results from the model with discrete-event simulations in Qualnet. The results show that our model predicts results that are very close to those attained by simulations, and requires seconds to complete compared to several hours of simulation time.

Exploiting medium access diversity in rate adaptive wireless LANs
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
Recent years have seen the growing popularity of multi-rate wireless network devices (e.g., 802.11a cards) that can exploit variations in channel conditions and improve overall network throughput. Concurrently, rate adaptation schemes have been developed that selectively increase data transmissions on a link when it offers good channel quality. In this paper, we propose a Medium Access Diversity (MAD) scheme that leverages the benefits of rate adaptation schemes by aggressively exploiting multiuser diversity. The basic mechanism of MAD is to obtain instantaneous channel condition information from multiple receivers and selectively transmit data to a receiver that improves the overall throughput of the network, while maintaining temporal fairness among multiple data flows. We identify and address the challenges in the design and implementation of MAD's three phases: channel probing, data transmission, and receiver scheduling. We also use analytical models to examine the tradeoff between network performance improvement and overhead of channel probing, and derive an asymptotic performance bound for the receiver scheduling algorithms used by MAD. Results from the analysis and the extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, MAD can improve the overall throughput of IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs by 50% as compared with the best existing rate adaptation scheme.

On using battery state for medium access control in ad hoc wireless networks
Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2004
One of the challenging issues in the energy-constrained ad~hoc wireless networks is to find ways that increase their lifetime. Squeezing maximum energy from the battery of the nodes of these networks requires the communication protocols to be designed such that they are aware of the state of the batteries. Traditional MAC protocols for ad~hoc networks are designed without considering the battery state. Major contributions of this paper are: (a) a novel distributed Battery Aware Medium Access Control (BAMAC(k)) protocol that takes benefit of the chemical properties of the batteries, to provide fair scheduling and increased network and node lifetime through uniform discharge of batteries, (b) a discrete time Markov chain analysis for batteries of the nodes of ad~hoc wireless networks, and (c) a thorough comparative study of our protocol with IEEE 802.11 and DWOP (Distributed Wireless Ordering Protocol) MAC protocols. The key idea proposed in this paper is to piggy-back nodes' battery-state information with the packets sent by the nodes by means of which the nodes are scheduled to ensure a uniform battery discharge. We model the operation of the battery using a discrete time Markovian chain. Using the theoretical analysis, we calculate lifetime of the battery in terms of maximum number of packets that a node can transmit before its battery drains fully. Extensive simulations have shown that our protocol extends the battery lifetime consuming 96% and 60% less percentage nominal capacity spent per packet transmission compared to the IEEE 802.11 and the DWOP MAC protocols, respectively. In general, performance results show that BAMAC(k) outperforms IEEE 802.11 and DWOP MAC protocols, in terms of power consumption, fairness, and lifetime of the nodes. We have also analyzed the factors that influence the uniform discharge of batteries and their lifetime.

Improving loss resilience with multi-radio diversity in wireless networks
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
This paper describes the Multi-Radio Diversity (MRD) wireless system, which uses path diversity to improve loss resilience in wireless local area networks WLANs). MRD coordinates wireless receptions among multiple radios to improve loss resilience in the face of path-dependent frame corruption over the radio. MRD incorporates two techniques to recover from bit errors and lower the loss rates observed by higher layers, without consuming much extra bandwidth. The first technique is frame combining in which multiple, possibly erroneous, copies of a given frame are combined together in an attempt to recover the frame without retransmission. The second technique is a low-overhead retransmission scheme called request-for-acknowledgment (RFA), which operates above the link layer and below the network layer to attempt to recover from frame combining failures. We present an analysis that determines how the parameters for these algorithms should be chosen.We have designed and implemented MRD as a fully functional WLAN infrastructure based on 802.11a. In our testbed, we measured throughput gains up to 2.3 - over single radio communication schemes employing 802.11's autorate adaptation scheme.

Architecture and evaluation of an unplanned 802.11b mesh network
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
This paper evaluates the ability of a wireless mesh architecture to provide high performance Internet access while demanding little deployment planning or operational management. The architecture considered in this paper has unplanned node placement (rather than planned topology), omni-directional antennas (rather than directional links), and multi-hop routing (rather than single-hop base stations). These design decisions contribute to ease of deployment, an important requirement for community wireless networks. However, this architecture carries the risk that lack of planning might render the network's performance unusably low. For example, it might be necessary to place nodes carefully to ensure connectivity; the omni-directional antennas might provide uselessly short radio ranges; or the inefficiency of multi-hop forwarding might leave some users effectively disconnected.The paper evaluates this unplanned mesh architecture with a case study of the Roofnet 802.11b mesh network. Roofnet consists of 37 nodes spread over four square kilometers of an urban area. The network provides users with usable performance despite lack of planning: the average inter-node throughput is 627 kbits/second, even though the average route has three hops.The paper evaluates multiple aspects of the architecture: the effect of node density on connectivity and throughput; the characteristics of the links that the routing protocol elects to use; the usefulness of the highly connected mesh afforded by omni-directional antennas for robustness and throughput; and the potential performance of a single-hop network using the same nodes as Roofnet.

Capacity of multi-channel wireless networks: impact of number of channels and interfaces
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
This paper studies how the capacity of a static multi-channel network scales as the number of nodes, n, increases. Gupta and Kumar have determined the capacity of single-channel networks, and those bounds are applicable to multi-channel networks as well, provided each node in the network has a dedicated interface per channel.In this work, we establish the capacity of general multi-channel networks wherein the number of interfaces, m, may be smaller than the number of channels, c. We show that the capacity of multi-channel networks exhibits different bounds that are dependent on the ratio between c and m. When the number of interfaces per node is smaller than the number of channels, there is a degradation in the network capacity in many scenarios. However, one important exception is a random network with up to O(log n) channels, wherein the network capacity remains at the Gupta and Kumar bound of &#920;(W&#8730;noverlog n) bits/sec, independent of the number of interfaces available at each node. Since in many practical networks, number of channels available is small (e.g., IEEE 802.11 networks), this bound is of practical interest. This implies that it may be possible to build capacity-optimal multi-channel networks with as few as one interface per node. We also extend our model to consider the impact of interface switching delay, and show that in a random network with up to O(log n) channels, switching delay may not affect capacity if multiple interfaces are used.

Joint channel assignment and routing for throughput optimization in multi-radio wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
Multi-hop infrastructure wireless mesh networks offer increased reliability, coverage and reduced equipment costs over their single-hop counterpart, wireless LANs. Equipping wireless routers with multiple radios further improves the capacity by transmitting over multiple radios simultaneously using orthogonal channels. Efficient channel assignment and routing is essential for throughput optimization of mesh clients. Efficient channel assignment schemes can greatly relieve the interference effect of close-by transmissions; effective routing schemes can alleviate potential congestion on any gateways to the Internet, thereby improving per-client throughput. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, we mathematically formulate the joint channel assignment and routing problem, taking into account the interference constraints, the number of channels in the network and the number of radios available at each mesh router. We then use this formulation to develop a solution for our problem that optimizes the overall network throughput subject to fairness constraints on allocation of scarce wireless capacity among mobile clients. We show that the performance of our algorithms is within a constant factor of that of any optimal algorithm for the joint channel assignment and routing problem. Our evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm can effectively exploit the increased number of channels and radios, and it performs much better than the theoretical worst case bounds.

Characterizing the capacity region in multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
Next generation fixed wireless broadband networks are being increasingly deployed as mesh networks in order to provide and extend access to the internet. These networks are characterized by the use of multiple orthogonal channels and nodes with the ability to simultaneously communicate with many neighbors using multiple radios (interfaces) over orthogonal channels. Networks based on the IEEE 802.11a/b/g and 802.16 standards are examples of these systems. However, due to the limited number of available orthogonal channels, interference is still a factor in such networks. In this paper, we propose a network model that captures the key practical aspects of such systems and characterize the constraints binding their behavior. We provide necessary conditions to verify the feasibility of rate vectors in these networks, and use them to derive upper bounds on the capacity in terms of achievable throughput, using a fast primal-dual algorithm. We then develop two link channel assignment schemes, one static and the other dynamic, in order to derive lower bounds on the achievable throughput. We demonstrate through simulations that the dynamic link channel assignment scheme performs close to optimal on the average, while the static link channel assignment algorithm also performs very well. The methods proposed in this paper can be a valuable tool for network designers in planning network deployment and for optimizing different performance objectives.

MAP: medial axis based geometric routing in sensor networks
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
One of the challenging tasks in the deployment of dense wireless networks (like sensor networks) is in devising a routing scheme for node to node communication. Important consideration includes scalability, routing complexity, the length of the communication paths and the load sharing of the routes. In this paper, we show that a compact and expressive abstraction of network connectivity by the medial axis enables efficient and localized routing. We propose MAP, a Medial Axis based naming and routing Protocol that does not require locations, makes routing decisions locally, and achieves good load balancing. In its preprocessing phase, MAP constructs the medial axis of the sensor field, defined as the set of nodes with at least two closest boundary nodes. The medial axis of the network captures both the complex geometry and non-trivial topology of the sensor field. It can be represented compactly by a graph whose size is comparable with the complexity of the geometric features (e.g., the number of holes). Each node is then given a name related to its position with respect to the medial axis. The routing scheme is derived through local decisions based on the names of the source and destination nodes and guarantees delivery with reasonable and natural routes. We show by both theoretical analysis and simulations that our medial axis based geometric routing scheme is scalable, produces short routes, achieves excellent load balancing, and is very robust to variations in the network model.

Effects of routing computations in content-based routing networks with mobile data sources

2005
This paper presents the first quantitative evaluation of the role of routing computations on performance when mobility is introduced to a content-based routing network. Additionally, the paper identifies the factors that affect the performance of a distributed publish/subscribe architecture supporting mobile publishers, formalizes publisher mobility protocols for distributed publish/subscribe systems, and develops and evaluates protocols that reduce the costs associated with supporting mobile publishers in publish/subscribe systems. Our results show that ignoring route computation time paints a false picture of the scalability of content-based routing networks, but that with appropriate protocols the adverse effects can be mitigated.

On designing incentive-compatible routing and forwarding protocols in wireless ad-hoc networks: an integrated approach using game theoretical and cryptographic techniques
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
In many applications, wireless ad-hoc networks are formed by devices belonging to independent users. Therefore, a challenging problem is how to provide incentives to stimulate cooperation. In this paper, we study ad-hoc games---the routing and packet forwarding games in wireless ad-hoc networks. Unlike previous work which focuses either on routing or on forwarding, this paper investigates both routing and forwarding. We first uncover an impossibility result---there does not exist a protocol such that following the protocol to always forward others' traffic is a dominant action. Then we define a novel solution concept called cooperation-optimal protocols. We present Corsac, a cooperation-optimal protocol consisting of a routing protocol and a forwarding protocol. The routing protocol of Corsac integrates VCG with a novel cryptographic technique to address the challenge in wireless ad-hoc networks that a link's cost (ie, its type) is determined by two nodes together. Corsac also applies efficient cryptographic techniques to design a forwarding protocol to enforce the routing decision, such that fulfilling the routing decision is the optimal action of each node in the sense that it brings the maximum utility to the node. Additionally, we extend our framework to a practical radio propagation model where a transmission is successful with a probability. We evaluate our protocols using simulations. Our evaluations demonstrate that our protocols provide incentives for nodes to forward packets.

Challenges: a radically new architecture for next generation mobile ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
Despite decades of research and development, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) continue to lag behind wireline networks in terms of latency, capacity and robustness. We contend that a key reason for this is the way MANETs are thought about and architected today. We propose a radically new architecture that we believe will elevate MANETs to a performance plane on par with wireline networks. Our design concept for next generation MANETs is based on several revolutionary ideas - 1) a relay-oriented physical layer that selectively switches incoming packets "on-the-fly" without the intervention of the MAC or network layers, 2) a path-centric medium access mechanism that acquires the floor for not just the next, but several hops toward the destination, 3) cooperative transport of packets in stages using diversity combining. Our vision is to enable emerging and future very-low-latency, very-high-bandwidth applications to work seamlessly over large MANETs. Realizing our vision requires solving a number of challenging problems. We enumerate and briefly discuss these exciting new research areas.

Challenges: communication through silence in wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are typically characterized by a limited energy supply at sensor nodes. Hence, energy efficiency is an important issue in the system design and operation of WSNs. In this paper, we introduce a novel communication paradigm that enables energy-efficient information delivery in wireless sensor networks. Compared with traditional communication strategies, the proposed scheme explores a new dimension - time, to deliver information efficiently. We refer to the strategy as Communication through Silence (CtS). We identify a key drawback of CtS - energy - throughput trade-off, and explore optimization mechanisms that can alleviate the trade-off. We then present several challenges that need to be overcome, primarily at the medium access control layer of the network protocol stack, in order to realize CtS effectively.

Challenge: CeTV and Ca-Fi - cellular and Wi-Fi over CATV
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
This paper introduces a novel concept that enables transmitting wireless communication over CATV networks. We present the architecture of a system for Cellular Communication over CATV (CeTV) and review the required modifications to the cable network. These modifications affect only the cable network, thereby enabling the system to operate with unmodified cellular phones. In addition to improving in-building coverage, the CeTV system significantly increases the capacity of the cellular network. We also present the architecture of a Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) over CATV (Ca-Fi) system. The implementation of the Ca-Fi system requires improving the MAC protocol used by the Access Points that are deployed within the cable network. However, it does not require modifying the users' devices. We present a few alternative MAC protocols which aim at polling 802.11 stations using the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). These protocols deal with, and take advantage of the special characteristics of the CATV network. The performance of the proposed protocols is evaluated analytically and via simulation.

Design and evaluation of a new MAC protocol for long-distance 802.11 mesh networks
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
802.11 has been used well beyond its original intended use of WLANs. Of particular interest to us in this paper is its use in long-distance mesh networks being designed/used for low-cost rural connectivity. We describe in detail a new MAC protocol, called 2P, that is suited for such networks in terms of efficiency. A significant challenge here is the implementation of this protocol on top of off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware, to preserve the cost benefits. We show how this can be achieved, by exploiting the flexibilities available within Prism2-based chipsets. We then present the dependence of 2P on the network topology, and show that it is indeed possible to design in practice, network topologies compatible with 2P. We describe experimental as well as simulation-based evaluations of 2P, and show that 2P achieves significant performance improvement (as much as 20 times more throughput) over 802.11 CSMA/CA in long-distance mesh networks.

Model T: an empirical model for user registration patterns in a campus wireless LAN
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
We derive an empirical model for spatial registration patterns of mobile users as they move within a campus wireless local area network (WLAN) environment and register at different access points. Such a model can be very useful in a variety of simulation studies of the performance of mobile wireless systems, such as that of resource management and mobility management protocols. We base the model on extensive experimental data from a campus WiFi LAN installation, representing traces from about 6000 users over a period of about 2 years. We divide the empirical data available to us into training and test data sets, develop the model based on the training set, and evaluate it against the test set.The model shows that user registration patterns exhibit a distinct hierarchy, and that WLAN access points (APs) can be clustered based on registration patterns. Cluster size distributions are highly skewed, as are intra-cluster transition probabilities and trace lengths, which can all be modeled well by the heavy-tailed Weibull distribution. The fraction of popular APs in a cluster, as a function of cluster size, can be modeled by exponential distributions. There is general similarity across hierarchies, in that inter-cluster registration patterns tend to have the same characteristics and distributions as intra-cluster patterns.We generate synthetic traces for intra-cluster transitions, inter-cluster transitions, and complete traces, and compare them against the corresponding traces from the test set. We define a set of metrics that evaluate how well the model captures the empirical features it is trying to represent. We find that the synthetic traces agree very well with the test set in terms of the metrics. We also compare the model to a simple modified random waypoint model as a baseline, and show the latter is not at all representative of the real data.The user of the model has the opportunity to use it as is, or can modify model parameters, such as the degree of randomness in registration patterns. We close with a brief discussion of further work to refine and extend the model.

Self-management in chaotic wireless deployments
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
Over the past few years, wireless networking technologies have made vast forays into our daily lives. Today, one can find 802.11 hardware and other personal wireless technology employed at homes, shopping malls, coffee shops and airports. Present-day wireless network deployments bear two important properties: they are unplanned, with most access points (APs) deployed by users in a spontaneous manner, resulting in highly variable AP densities; and they are unmanaged, since manually configuring and managing a wireless network is very complicated. We refer to such wireless deployments as being chaotic.In this paper, we present a study of the impact of interference in chaotic 802.11 deployments on end-client performance. First, using large-scale measurement data from several cities, we show that it is not uncommon to have tens of APs deployed in close proximity of each other. Moreover, most APs are not configured to minimize interference with their neighbors. We then perform trace-driven simulations to show that the performance of end-clients could suffer significantly in chaotic deployments. We argue that end-client experience could be significantly improved by making chaotic wireless networks self-managing. We design and evaluate automated power control and rate adaptation algorithms to minimize interference among neighboring APs, while ensuring robust end-client performance.

Modeling media access in embedded two-flow topologies of multi-hop wireless networks
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
In this paper, we decompose a large- or small-scale multi-hop wireless network into embedded subgraphs, each consisting of four nodes and two flow pairs. We systematically study all twelve possible topologies that arise according to whether the different nodes are in radio range of each other. We show that under both a random spatial distribution of nodes and random waypoint mobility with shortest-path routing, a critical and highly probable scenario is a class in which the channel state shared by the two flows is not only incomplete (i.e., the graph is not fully connected), but there is also asymmetry in the state between the two flows. We develop an accurate analytical model validated by simulations to characterize the long-term unfairness that naturally arises when CSMA with two- or four-way handshake is employed as a random access protocol. Moreover, we show that another key class of topologies consists of incomplete but symmetric shared state. We show via modeling and simulations that in this case, the system achieves long-term fairness, yet endures significant durations in which one flow dominates channel access with many repeated transmissions before relinquishing the channel. The model predicts the time-scales of this unfairness as a function of system parameters such as the maximum retransmission limit.

An analytical model for the dimensioning of a GPRS/EDGE network with a capacity constraint on a group of cells
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
This paper is a contribution to the generic problem of having simple and accurate models to dimension radio cells with data traffic on a GPRS or EDGE network. It addresses the issue of capacity limitation in a given cell due to coupling with other cells because of a central equipment or transmission link of limited capacity. A mobile station can't access the requested resource although it is alone in a cell. The traffic on other coupled cells leads to reach the global capacity limit. Our objective is to avoid the derivation of any multi-dimensional Markovian (or semi-Markovian) model, where each dimension corresponds to a given cell of the system. Such direct extensions would be of non-manageable complexity. Instead we derive an analytical model that captures in an aggregate way the coupling between cells. We show that the performance parameters of the GPRS/EDGE network can be derived quickly and with a very good accuracy. Finally, as our modeling framework allows very fast computations, we show how to use it to perform complex iterative dimensioning studies.

MoB: a mobile bazaar for wide-area wireless services
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2005
We introduce MoB, an infrastructure for collaborative wide-area wireless data services. MoB proposes to change the current model of data services in the following fundamental ways: (1) it decouples infrastructure providers from services providers and enables fine-grained competition, (2) it allows service interactions on arbitrary timescales, and, (3) it promotes flexible composition of these fine-grained service interactions based on user and application needs.At the heart of MoB is an open market architecture in which mobile users can opportunistically trade various services with each other in a flexible manner. In this paper we first describe the overall architecture of MoB including various enablers like user reputation management, incentive management, and accounting services. We next present our experience from both simulations as well as our prototype implementation of MoB in enhancing application performance in multiple different scenarios --- file transfers, web browsing, media streaming, and location-enhanced services.

PeopleNet: engineering a wireless virtual social network
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
People often seek information by asking other people even when they have access to vast reservoirs of information such as the Internet and libraries. This is because people are great sources of unique information, especially that which is location-specific, community-specific and time-specific. Social networking is effective because this type of information is often not easily available anywhere else. In this paper, we conceive a wireless virtual social network which mimics the way people seek information via social networking. PeopleNet is a simple, scalable and low-cost architecture for efficient information search in a distributed manner. It uses the infrastructure to propagate queries of a given type to users in specific geographic locations, called bazaars. Within each bazaar, the query is further propagated between neighboring nodes via peer-to-peer connectivity until it finds a matching query. The PeopleNet architecture can overlay easily on existing cellular infrastructure and entails minimal software installation. We identify three metrics for system performance: (i) probability of a match, (ii) time to find a match and (iii) number of matches found by a query. We describe two simple models, called the swap and spread models, for query propagation within a bazaar. We qualitatively argue that the swap model is better with respect to the performance metrics identified and demonstrate this via simulations. Next, we compute analytically the probability of match for the swap model. We show that the probability of match can be significantly improved if, prior to swapping queries, the nodes exchange some limited information about their buffer contents. We propose a simple greedy algorithm which uses this limited information to decide which queries to swap. We show via simulation that this algorithm achieves significantly better performance. Overall our results demonstrate that PeopleNet, with its bazaar concept and peer-to-peer query propagation, can provide a simple and efficient mechanism for seeking information.

Interaction design is a major issue for mobile information systems in terms of not only the choice of input-output channels and presentation of information, but also the application of context-awareness. To support experimentation with these factors, we have developed a platform that supports the rapid prototyping of multi-channel, multi-modal, context-aware applications. The paper presents the main components of the platform and describes how it was used to develop a tourist information system for an international arts festival where interaction was based on a combination of speech input-output and interactive paper.

Using mobile relays to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2005
In this paper we investigate the benefits of a heterogeneous architecture for wireless sensor networks composed of a few resource rich mobile nodes and a large number of simple static nodes. These mobile nodes can either act as mobile relays or mobile sinks. To investigate the performance of these two options and the trade-offs associated with these two options, we first consider a finite network. We then compute the lifetime for different routing algorithms for three cases (i) when the network is all static (ii) when there is one mobile sink and (iii) when there is one mobile relay. We find that using the mobile node as a sink results in the maximum improvement in lifetime. We contend however that in hostile terrains, it might not always be possible for the sink to be mobile. We then investigate the performance of a large dense network with one mobile relay and show that the improvement in network lifetime over an all static network is upper bounded by a factor of four. Also, the proof implies that the mobile relay needs to stay only within a two hop radius of the sink. We then construct a joint mobility and routing algorithm which comes close to the upper bound. However this algorithm requires all the nodes in the network to be aware of the location of the mobile node. We then proposed an alternative algorithm, which achieves the same performance, but requires only a limited number of nodes in the network to be aware of the location of the mobile. We finally compare the performance of the mobile relay and mobile sink and show that for a densely deployed sensor field of radius R hops, we require O(R) mobile relays to achieve the same performance as the mobile sink.

Barrier coverage with wireless sensors
Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2005
In old times, castles were surrounded by moats (deep trenches filled with water, and even alligators) to thwart or discourage intrusion attempts. One can now replace such barriers with stealthy and wireless sensors. In this paper, we develop theoretical foundations for laying barriers of wireless sensors. We define the notion of k-barrier coverage of a belt region using wireless sensors. We propose efficient algorithms using which one can quickly determine, after deploying the sensors, whether a region is k-barrier covered. Next, we establish the optimal deployment pattern to achieve k-barrier coverage when deploying sensors deterministically. Finally, we consider barrier coverage with high probability when sensors are deployed randomly. We introduce two notions of probabilistic barrier coverage in a belt region -- weak and strong barrier coverage. While weak barrier-coverage with high probability guarantees the detection of intruders as they cross a barrier of stealthy sensors, a sensor network providing strong barrier-coverage with high probability (at the expense of more sensors) guarantees the detection of all intruders crossing a barrier of sensors, even when the sensors are not stealthy. Both types of barrier coverage require significantly less number of sensors than full-coverage, where every point in the region needs to be covered. We derive critical conditions for weak k-barrier coverage, using which one can compute the minimum number of sensors needed to provide weak k-barrier coverage with high probability in a given belt region. Deriving critical conditions for strong k-barrier coverage for a belt region is still an open problem.

Cross-layer optimization for routing data traffic in UWB-based sensor networks

2005
Ultra-wideband (UWB) has great potential for wireless communications in emerging applications such as sensor networks. This paper considers UWB-based sensor networks and studies the following problem: given a set of source sensor nodes in the network each generating a certain data rate, is it possible to relay all these rates successfully to the base-station? We follow a cross-layer optimization approach, with joint consideration of link layer scheduling, power control, and network layer routing. The optimization problem is formulated as a non-linear programming problem. For small-sized networks, we develop a powerful approximation solution procedure to this problem based on the branch-and-bound approach and the novel Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT). For large-sized networks, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm by partitioning the sensor network into a core centered around the base-station and an edge that is outside the core. We also provide a closed-form analysis for the maximum rate that a base-station can receive. Simulation results exhibit the efficacy of our proposed optimization solution procedure and demonstrate the importance of the cross-layer approach to UWB-based sensor networks.

Computationally efficient scheduling with the physical interference model for throughput improvement in wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Wireless mesh networks are expected to be widely used to provide Internet access in the near future. In order to fulfill the expectations, these networks should provide high throughput simultaneously to many users. Recent research has indicated that, due to its conservative CSMA/CA channel access scheme and RTS/CTS mechanism, 802.11 is not suitable to achieve this goal.In this paper, we investigate throughput improvements achievable by replacing CSMA/CA with an STDMA scheme where transmissions are scheduled according to the physical interference model. To this end, we present a computationally efficient heuristic for computing a feasible schedule under the physical interference model and we prove, under uniform random node distribution, an approximation factor for the length of this schedule relative to the shortest schedule possible with physical interference. This represents the first known polynomial-time algorithm for this problem with a proven approximation factor.We also evaluate the throughput and execution time of this algorithm on representative wireless mesh network scenarios through packet-level simulations. The results show that throughput with STDMA and physical-interference-based scheduling can be up to three times higher than 802.11 for the parameter values simulated. The results also show that our scheduling algorithm can schedule networks with 2000 nodes in about 2.5 minutes.

A coordinate-based approach for exploiting temporal-spatial diversity in wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
In this paper, we consider the problem of mitigating interference and improving network capacity in wireless mesh networks from the angle of temporal-spatial diversity. In a nutshell, while the achievable throughput on a multihop wireless path is limited by intra-flow interference, the overall capacity of a multihop wireless network can be increased by exploiting temporal-spatial diversity of concurrent transmissions that exist among a number of wireless links. Connections that are routed along multihop wireless paths can be scheduled to take place simultaneously if their transmissions do not interfere with each other (significantly).To make a case of exploiting the temporal-spatial diversity to improve network capacity, we focus on transporting  downstream traffic at gateway nodes with Internet access. We propose to construct, based on measurements of received signal strengths, a virtual coordinate system that is used to determine the sets of paths along which transmissions can take place with the least inter-flow interference. Based on the sets of non-interfering paths, the gateway node then determines the order with which a gateway node schedules frames of different connections to be transmitted. Through extensive simulation (with real-life measurement traces on an operational, city-wide wireless community network), we show that the downstream throughput of a gateway node in a wireless mesh network can be improved by 10-35% under a variety of network topologies and traffic distributions. This, coupled with the fact that the proposed approach requires only minor code change in the gateway nodes and does not require any additional hardware, makes it a viable option to improving network capacity in existing wireless mesh networks.

Enabling distributed throughput maximization in wireless mesh networks: a partitioning approach
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
This paper considers the interaction between channel assignment and distributed scheduling in multi-channel multiradio Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). Recently, a number of distributed scheduling algorithms for wireless networks have emerged. Due to their distributed operation, these algorithms can achieve only a fraction of the maximum possible throughput. As an alternative to increasing the throughput fraction by designing new algorithms, in this paper we present a novel approach that takes advantage of the inherent multi-radio capability of WMNs. We show that this capability can enable partitioning of the network into subnetworks in which simple distributed scheduling algorithms can achieve 100% throughput. The partitioning is based on the recently introduced notion of Local Pooling. Using this notion, we characterize topologies in which 100% throughput can be achieved distributedly. These topologies are used in order to develop a number of channel assignment algorithms that are based on a matroid intersection algorithm. These algorithms partition a network in a manner that not only expands the capacity regions of the subnetworks but also allows distributed algorithms to achieve these capacity regions. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the algorithms via simulation and show that they significantly increase the distributedly achievable capacity region.

On accurate measurement of link quality in multi-hop wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
This paper presents a highly efficient and accurate link-quality measurement framework, called EAR (Efficient and Accurate link-quality monitoR), for multi-hop wireless mesh networks, that has several salient features. First, it exploits three complementary measurement schemes: passive, cooperative, and active monitoring. EAR maximizes the measurement accuracy by (i) dynamically and adaptively adopting one of these schemes and (ii) opportunistically exploiting the  nicast application traffic present in the network, while minimizing the measurement overhead. Second, EAR effectively identifies the existence of wireless link asymmetry by measuring the quality of each link in both directions of the link, thus improving the utilization of network capacity by up to 114%. Finally, its reliance on both the network layer and the IEEE 802.11-based device driver solutions makes EAR easily deployable in existing multi-hop wireless mesh networks without system recompilation or MAC firmware modification. EAR has been evaluated extensively via both ns-2-based simulation and experimentation on our Linux-based implementation. Both simulation and experimentation results have shown EAR to provide highly accurate link-quality measurements with minimum overhead.

A measurement study of vehicular internet access using in situ Wi-Fi networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
The impressive penetration of 802.11-based wireless networks in many metropolitan areas around the world offers, for the first time, the opportunity of a "grassroots" wireless Internet service provided by users who "open up" their 802.11 (Wi-Fi) access points in a controlled manner to mobile clients. While there are many business, legal, and policy issues to be ironed out for this vision to become reality, we are concerned in this paper with an important technical question surrounding such a system: can such an unplanned network service provide reasonable performance to network clients moving in cars at vehicular speeds.To answer this question, we present the results of a measurement study carried out over 290 "drive hours" over a few cars under typical driving conditions, in and around the Boston metropolitan area (some of our data also comes from a car in Seattle). With a simple caching optimization to speed-up IP address acquisition, we find that for our driving patterns the median duration of link-layer connectivity at vehicular speeds is 13 seconds, the median connection upload bandwidth is 30 KBytes/s, and that the mean duration between successful associations to APs is 75 seconds. We also find that connections are equally probable across a range of urban speeds (up to 60 km/hour in our measurements). Our end-to-end TCP upload experiments had a median throughput of about 30 KBytes/s, which is consistent with typical uplink speeds of home broadband links in the US. The median TCP connection is capable of uploading about 216 KBytes of data.Our high-level conclusion is that grassroots Wi-Fi networks are viable for a variety of applications, particularly ones that can tolerate intermittent connectivity. We discuss how our measurement results can improve transport protocols in such networks.

Packet-level diversity - from theory to practice: an 802.11-based experimental investigation
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Packet-level diversity, or distributing packet transmissions over multiple, diverse channels, offers benefits in improving communication performance and robustness to channel variations. Previous works have analyzed and quantified those benefits, and developed transmission policies to realize them. However, translating those benefits into practice still faces numerous challenges from uncertainty in the adequacy of the channel models used to develop policies, to implementation dificulties in realizing the precise transmission schedules they mandate. This work is a first step in assessing what remains of those benefits once confronted with such practical challenges. Our investigation is carried out over an 802.11 testbed, where diversity is realized through the different frequency bands available for transmissions between hosts and access points. We use the testbed to evaluate the impact of transmission policies, channel characteristics, channel correlation, and various end-system constraints that affect our ability to precisely control transmissions timing. Our investigation reveals that in spite of the many gaps that exist between theory and practice, packet-level diversity still provides a simple solution to improve transmission performance and robustness across a broad range of configurations.

Long-distance 802.11b links: performance measurements and experience
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
The use of 802.11 long-distance links is a cost-effective means of providing wireless connectivity to rural areas. Although deployments in this setting are increasing, a systematic study of the performance of 802.11 in these settings is lacking. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: (a)we present a detailed performance study of a set of long-distance 802.11b links at various layers of the network stack, and (b)we document the various non-obvious experiences during our study.Our study includes eight long-distance links, ranging from 1km to 37km in length. Unlike prior studies of outdoor 802.11 links, we find that the error rate as a function of the received signal strength behaves close to theory. Time correlation of any packet errors is negligible across a range of time-scales. We have observed at least one of the link to be robust to rain and fog. But any interference on the long-distance links can be detrimental to performance. Apart from this however, such long-distance links can be planned to work well with predictable performance. During our measurements, we have observed a few hardware/driver quirks as well as system bottlenecks apart from the wireless link itself. We believe that our measurements and the documentation of our experience will help future network planning as well as protocol design for these networks.

Analysis and implications of student contact patterns derived from campus schedules
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Characterizing mobility or contact patterns in a campus environment is of interest for a variety of reasons. Existing studies of these patterns can be classified into two basic approaches - model based and measurement based. The model based approach involves constructing a mathematical model to generate movement patterns while the measurement based approach measures locations and proximity of wireless devices to infer mobility patterns. In this paper, we take a completely different approach. First we obtain the class schedules and class rosters from a university-wide Intranet learning portal, and use this information to infer contacts made between students. The value of our approach is in the population size involved in the study, where contact patterns among 22341 students are analyzed. This paper presents the characteristics of these contact patterns, and explores how these patterns affect three scenarios. We first look at the characteristics from the DTN perspective, where we study inter-contact time and time distance between pairs of students. Next, we present how these characteristics impact the spread of mobile computer viruses, and show that viruses can spread to virtually the entire student population within a day. Finally, we consider aggregation of information from a large number of mobile, distributed sources, and demonstrate that the contact patterns can be exploited to design efficient aggregation algorithms, in which only a small number of nodes (less than 0.5%) is needed to aggregate a large fraction (over 90%) of the data.

Stochastic event capture using mobile sensors subject to a quality metric
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Mobile sensors cover more area over a period of time than the same number of stationary sensors. However, the quality of coverage achieved by mobile sensors depends on the velocity, mobility pattern, number of mobile sensors deployed and the dynamics of the phenomenon being sensed. The gains attained by mobile sensors over static sensors and the optimal motion strategies for mobile sensors are not well understood. In this paper we consider the problem of event capture using mobile sensors. The events of interest arrive at certain points in the sensor field and fade away according to arrival and departure time distributions. An event is said to be captured if it is sensed by one of the mobile sensors before it fades away. For this scenario we analyze how the quality of coverage scales with the velocity, path and number of mobile sensors. We characterize the cases where the deployment of mobile sensors has no advantage over static sensors and find the optimal velocity pattern that a mobile sensor should adopt.We also present algorithms for two motion planning problems: (i) for a single sensor, what is the minimum speed and sensor trajectory required to satisfy a bound on event loss probability and (ii) for sensors with fixed speed, what is the minimum number of sensors required to satisfy a bound on event loss probability. When events occur only along a line or a closed curve our algorithms return optimal velocity for the minimum velocity problem. For the minimum sensor problem, the number of sensors used is within a factor two of the optimal solution. For the case where the events occur at arbitrary points on a plane we present heuristic algorithms for the above motion planning problems and bound their performance with respect to the optimal. The results of this paper have wide range of applications in areas like surveillance, wildlife monitoring, hybrid sensor networks and under-water sensor networks.

Localization in sparse networks using sweeps
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Determining node positions is essential for many next-generation network functionalities. Previous localization algorithms lack correctness guarantees or require network density higher than required for unique localizability. In this paper, we describe a class of algorithms for fine-grained localization called Sweeps. Sweeps correctly finitely localizes all nodes in bilateration networks. Sweeps also handles angle measurements and noisy measurements. We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm through extensive simulations on a large number of networks, upon which it consistently localizes one-thousand-node networks of average degree less than five in less than two minutes on a consumer PC.

Boundary recognition in sensor networks by topological methods
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Wireless sensor networks are tightly associated with the underlying environment in which the sensors are deployed. The global topology of the network is of great importance to both sensor network applications and the implementation of networking functionalities. In this paper we study the problem of topology discovery, in particular, identifying boundaries in a sensor network. Suppose a large number of sensor nodes are scattered in a geometric region, with nearby nodes communicating with each other directly. Our goal is to find the boundary nodes by using only connectivity information. We do not assume any knowledge of the node locations or inter-distances, nor do we enforce that the communication graph follows the unit disk graph model. We propose a simple, distributed algorithm that correctly detects nodes on the boundaries and connects them into meaningful boundary cycles. We obtain as a byproduct the medial axis of the sensor field, which has applications in creating virtual coordinates for routing. We show by extensive simulation that the algorithm gives good results even for networks with low density. We also prove rigorously the correctness of the algorithm for continuous geometric domains.

Practical synchronization techniques for multi-channel MAC
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Researchers have proposed many wireless MAC protocols such as [20], [8], [25], [24], [6], and [17] which exploit frequency-agile radios and multiple available channels to increase network through-put. These protocols usually only require each node to have one radio. By carefully coordinating the frequency hopping of different nodes, different node pairs can use multiple channels simultaneously. In [17], Mo et al classified these protocols into four generalized categories and compared their performances through both analysis and simulation. They found that the Parallel Rendezvous family of protocols has the best overall performance by removing the bottleneck of a single control channel. These protocols show good promise for use with multi-hop networks because these networks suffer from self-interference and traditional MAC protocols using only one channel often fail to provide satisfactory throughput. However, we are not aware of any implemented Parallel Rendezvous multi-channel MAC protocols. We argue one major reason is that existing proposals such as McMAC[17] and SSCH[6] have not thoroughly considered a practical aspect of the design essential for a working implementation, namely: synchronization. Through an exploration including an implementation exercise on hardware, we show that synchronization for multi-channel MAC protocols is a non-trivial problem. We designed and implemented a synchronization mechanism specifically for this purpose and show that it has tackled the problem of synchronizing one-hop neighbor pairs effectively, thereby paving the way for efficient multi-channel MAC protocols.

Robust rate adaptation for 802.11 wireless networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Rate adaptation is a mechanism unspecified by the 802.11 standards, yet critical to the system performance by exploiting the multi-rate capability at the physical layer.I n this paper, we conduct a systematic and experimental study on rate adaptation over 802.11 wireless networks. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we critique five design guidelines adopted by most existing algorithms. Our study reveals that these seemingly correct guidelines can be misleading in practice, thus incur significant performance penalty in certain scenarios. The fundamental challenge is that rate adaptation must accurately estimate the channel condition despite the presence of various dynamics caused by fading, mobility and hidden terminals. Second, we design and implement a new Robust Rate Adaptation Algorithm (RRAA)that addresses the above challenge. RRAA uses short-term loss ratio to opportunistically guide its rate change decisions, and an adaptive RTS filter to prevent collision losses from triggering rate decrease. Our extensive experiments have shown that RRAA outperforms three well-known rate adaptation solutions (ARF, AARF, and SampleRate) in all tested scenarios, with throughput improvement up to 143%.

IQU: practical queue-based user association management for WLANs
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Flash crowds and high concentrations of users in wireless LANs (WLANs) cause significant interference problems and unsustainable load at access points. This leads to poor connectivity for users, severe performance degradation, and possible WLAN collapse. To validate this claim, we present two case studies of large, heavily loaded operational WLANs. These studies provide significant insight into the degraded performance and collapse of a WLAN during heavy use. To address these problems, we propose IQU, a practical queue-based user association management system for heavily loaded WLANs. IQU grants users fair opportunities to access the WLAN while maintaining high overall throughput, even when the WLAN is heavily loaded. The basic premise of IQU is to control user associations with the WLAN through request queues and work period allocations. We implement a prototype of IQU and evaluate it on a wireless testbed. Our evaluation demonstrates that IQU significantly improves network throughput under heavy load; the tradeoff is that users have to wait for network access. We explore the impact of IQU parameters on system performance, and validate the robustness of IQU under heavy load conditions. Through IQU, WLANs can be utilized efficiently and network collapse prevented.

Distributed channel management in uncoordinated wireless environments
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Wireless 802.11 hotspots have grown in an uncoordinated fashion with highly variable deployment densities. Such uncoordinated deployments, coupled with the difficulty of implementing coordination protocols, has often led to conflicting configurations (e.g., in choice of transmission power and channel of operation) among the corresponding Access Points (APs). Overall, such conflicts cause both unpredictable network performance and unfairness among clients of neighboring hotspots. In this paper, we focus on the fairness problem for uncoordinated deployments. We study this problem from the channel assignment perspective. Our solution is based on the notion of channel-hopping, and meets all the important design considerations for control methods in uncoordinated deployments - distributed in nature, minimal to zero coordination among APs belonging to different hotspots, simple to implement, and interoperable with existing standards. In particular, we propose a specific algorithm called MAXchop, which works efficiently when using only non-overlapping wireless channels, but is particularly effective in exploiting partially-overlapped channels that have been proposed in recent literature. We also evaluate how our channel assignment approach complements previously proposed carrier sensing techniques in providing further performance improvements. Through extensive simulations on real hotspot topologies and evaluation of a full implementation of this technique, we demonstrate the efficacy of these techniques for not only fairness, but also the aggregate throughput, metrics.We believe that this is the first work that brings into focus the fairness properties of channel hopping techniques and we hope that the insights from this research will be applied to other domains where a fair division of a system's resources is an important consideration.

Mitigating attacks on open functionality in SMS-capable cellular networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
The transformation of telecommunications networks from homogeneous closed systems providing only voice services to Internet-connected open networks that provide voice and data services presents significant security challenges. For example, recent research illustrated that a carefully crafted DoS attack via text messaging could incapacitate all voice communications in a metropolitan area with little more than a cable modem. This attack highlights a growing threat to these systems; namely, cellular networks are increasingly exposed to adversaries both in and outside the network. In this paper, we use a combination of modeling and simulation to demonstrate the feasibility of targeted text messaging attacks. Under realistic network conditions, we show that adversaries can achieve blocking rates of more than 70% with only limited resources. We then develop and characterize five techniques from within two broad classes of countermeasures - queue management and resource provisioning. Our analysis demonstrates that these techniques can eliminate or extensively mitigate even the most intense targeted text messaging attacks. We conclude by considering the tradeoffs inherent to the application of these techniques in current and next generation telecommunications networks.

A 3 : application-aware acceleration for wireless data networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
A tremendous amount of research has been done toward improving transport layer performance over wireless data networks. The improved transport layer protocols are typically application-unaware. In this paper, we argue that the behavior of applications can and do dominate the actual performance experienced. More importantly, we show that for practical applications, application behavior all but completely negates any improvements achievable through better transport layer protocols. In this context, we motivate an application-aware, but application transparent, solution suite called A 3  (application-aware acceleration) that uses a set of design principles realized in an application specific fashion to overcome the typical behavioral problems of applications. We demonstrate the performance of A3 through emulations using realistic application traffic traces.

Metastability of CDMA cellular systems
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
In this paper, it is shown that the coexistence of a variety of different traffics in third generation cellular networks may lead to a very undesirable behavior of the whole network: a metastability property. When this property holds, the state of the network fluctuates on a very long time scale between different set of states. These long oscillations of the network make impossible to predict the average performances of some of the key characteristics of the connections, such as the handoff blocking rate or the probability of call blocking. As a consequence, the quality of service provided by such a network can be guaranteed only by, sometimes poor, lower bounds. Experiments of a UMTS network with this behavior are presented and the analysis of a corresponding simplified mathematical model is developed. The practical implications in the design of radio resource management for CDMA cellular networks are discussed.

TCP-aware resource allocation in CDMA networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
TCP is the dominant transport protocol over both wired and wireless links. It is however, well known that TCP is not suitable for wireless networks and several solutions have been proposed to rectify this shortcoming. In this work, we explore cross-layer optimization of the rate adaptation feature of cellular networks to optimize throughput of a single long-lived TCP session. Modern cellular networks rate RF technology that allows them to dynamically vary the wireless channel rate in response to user demand and channel conditions. However, the set of data rates as well as the scheduler's rate adaptation policy are typically chosen to optimize throughput for inelastic applications. In order to optimize such a system for TCP, we propose a two state TCP-aware scheduler that switches between two chanrates as a function of the TCP sending rate. We develop a fluid model of the steady-state behavior of a TCP session in such a system and derive analytical expressions for TCP throughput that explicitly account for rate variability as well as the dependency between the scheduler and TCP. Using the model we choose RF layer parameters that, in conjunction with the TCP-aware scheduler, improve term throughput of a single TCP flow by 15.25%. We also compare our analytical results against those obtained from ns-2 simulations and confirm that our model indeed closely approximates TCP behavior in such an environment.

On the complexity of scheduling in wireless networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
We consider the problem of throughput-optimal scheduling in wireless networks subject to interference constraints. We model the interference using a family of K -hop interference models. We define a K-hop interference model as one for which no two links within K hops can successfully transmit at the same time (Note that IEEE 802.11 DCF corresponds to a 2-hop interference model.) .For a given K, a throughput-optimal scheduler needs to solve a maximum weighted matching problem subject to the K-hop interference constraints. For K=1, the resulting problem is the classical Maximum Weighted Matching problem, that can be solved in polynomial time. However, we show that for K&gt;1,the resulting problems are NP-Hard and cannot be approximated within a factor that grows polynomially with the number of nodes. Interestingly, we show that for specific kinds of graphs, that can be used to model the underlying connectivity graph of a wide range of wireless networks, the resulting problems admit polynomial time approximation schemes. We also show that a simple greedy matching algorithm provides a constant factor approximation to the scheduling problem for all K in this case. We then show that under a setting with single-hop traffic and no rate control, the maximal scheduling policy considered in recent related works can achieve a constant fraction of the capacity region for networks whose connectivity graph can be represented using one of the above classes of graphs. These results are encouraging as they suggest that one can develop distributed algorithms to achieve near optimal throughput in case of a wide range of wireless networks.

Broadcast capacity in multihop wireless networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
In this paper we study the broadcast capacity of multihop wireless networks which we define as the maximum rate at which broadcast packets can be generated in the network such that all nodes receive the packets successfully in a limited time. We employ the Protocol Model for successful packet reception usually adopted in network capacity studies and provide novel upper and lower bounds for the broadcast capacity for arbitrary connected networks. In a homogeneous dense network these bounds simplify to &#920;(W/max(1,&#916;d)) where W is the wireless channel capacity, &#916; the interference parameter, and d the number of dimensions of space in which the network lies. Interestingly, we show that the broadcast capacity does not change by more than a constant factor when we vary the number of nodes, the radio range, the area of the network, and even the node mobility. To address the achievability of capacity, we demonstrate that any broadcast scheme based on a backbone of size proportional to the Minimum Connected Dominating Set guarantees a throughput within a constant factor of the broadcast capacity. Finally, we demonstrate that broadcast capacity, in stark contrast to unicast capacity, does not depend on the choice of source nodes or the dimension of the network.

Performance analysis of access selection and transmit diversity in multi-access networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Motivated by the "beyond 3g" vision of radio access network integration and coordinated radio resource management, a purely analytical performance assessment is presented for a single access point integrating multiple radio accesses. Principal focus is placed on the evaluation of multi-user diversity, multi-access diversity and trunking gains. Scenarios with persistent and non-persistent data flows are investigated, concentrating on throughput and transfer time performance, respectively. A number of numerical experiments are included in order to quantify the relative contribution of the distinguished aspects to the performance gain. These experiments indicate that the exploitation of multi-user diversity with a channel-aware access selection scheme attains the most significant gains, while also the trunking gain that is due to an above-proportional performance enhancement when aggregating system-specific capacities, is noted to be significant. The assignment of multiple accesses to a given flow is demonstrated to have limited potential.

Efficient interference-aware TDMA link scheduling for static wireless networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
We study efficient link scheduling for a multihop wireless network to maximize its throughput. Efficient link scheduling can greatly reduce the interference effect of close-by transmissions. Unlike the previous studies that often assume a unit disk graph model, we assume that different terminals could have different transmission ranges and different interference ranges. In our model, it is also possible that a communication link may not exist due to barriers or is not used by a predetermined routing protocol, while the transmission of a node always result interference to all non-intended receivers within its interference range. Using a mathematical formulation, we develop synchronized TDMA link schedulings that optimize the networking throughput. Specifically, by assuming known link capacities and link traffic loads, we study link scheduling under the RTS/CTS interference model and the protocol interference model with fixed transmission power. For both models, we present both efficient centralized and distributed algorithms that use time slots within a constant factor of the optimum. We also present efficient distributed algorithms whose performances are still comparable with optimum, but with much less communications. Our theoretical results are corroborated by extensive simulation studies.

Localized algorithm for aggregate fairness in wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
For data-collection applications in sensor networks, it is important to ensure all data sources have equal (or weighted) access to network bandwidth so that the base stations receive a complete picture about the monitored area. We point out the fairness problem in the current design of sensor networks, which may cause extremely biased bandwidth allocations. It is a challenge to design a fully distributed fairness solution due to the lack of global knowledge about the distribution of data sources and their routing paths. This paper proposes a new aggregate fairness model and a localized algorithm (called AFA) that implements the model. AFA is designed to work with any routing protocol. In particular, it allows the packets from a data source to follow an arbitrary set of forwarding paths to the base stations. This flexibility makes it considerably harder to allocate bandwidth fairly among different data sources. AFA solves the problem with only localized operations at the sensors. It is easy to implement, which is an attractive property for sensor networks. Moreover, the algorithm automatically adjusts a sensor's forwarding rate to avoid packet drops due to downstream congestion, which helps improve energy efficiency. We perform extensive simulations, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve end-to-end fairness.

In-network storage such as geographical hash table (GHTs) has been proposed to store data at rendezvous nodes for consumers to retrieve. In this paper, we propose a double rulings scheme which stores data replica at a curve instead of one or multiple isolated sensors. The consumer travels along another curve which guarantees to intersect with the producer curve. The double rulings is a natural extension of the flat hashing scheme such as GHTs with improved query locality, i.e., consumers close to producers find the data quickly, and structured aggregate queries, i.e., a consumer following a curve is able to retrieve all the data. Further, by the flexibility of retrieval mechanisms we have better routing robustness and data robustness. We show by simulation that the double rulings scheme provide reduced communication costs and more balanced traffic load on the sensors.

Routing algorithms for delay-insensitive and delay-sensitive applications in underwater sensor networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Underwater sensor networks consist of sensors and vehicles deployed to perform collaborative monitoring tasks over a given region. Underwater sensor networks will find applications in oceano-graphic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster prevention, assisted navigation, tactical surveillance, and mine reconnaissance. Underwater acoustic networking is the enabling technology for these applications. In this paper, an architecture for three-dimensional underwater sensor networks is considered, and a model characterizing the acoustic channel utilization efficiency is introduced, which allows investigating some fundamental characteristics of the underwater environment. In particular, the model allows setting the optimal packet size for underwater communications given monitored volume, density of the sensor network, and application requirements. Moreover, the problem of data gathering is investigated at the network layer by considering the cross-layer interactions between the routing functions and the characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel. Two distributed routing algorithms are introduced for delay-insensitive and delay-sensitive applications. The proposed solutions allow each node to select its next hop, with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption taking the varying condition of the underwater channel and the different application requirements into account. The proposed routing solutions are shown to achieve the performance targets by means of simulation.

On optimal communication cost for gathering correlated data through wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
In many energy-constrained wireless sensor networks, nodes cooperatively forward correlated sensed data to data sinks. In order to reduce the communication cost (e.g.overall energy) used for data collection, previous works have focused on specific coding schemes, such as Slepian-Wolf Code or Explicit Entropy Code. However, the minimum communication cost under arbitrary coding/routing schemes has not yet been characterized. In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the total communication cost of a wireless sensor network with a single sink. We prove that the minimum communication cost can be achieved using Slepian-Wolf Code and Commodity Flow Routing when the link communication cost is a convex function of link data rate. Furthermore, we find it useful to introduce a new metric distance entropy, a generalization of entropy, to characterize the data collection limit of networked sources. When the energy consumption is proportional to the link data rate (e.g.normally in 802.11), we show that distance entropy provides a lower bound of the communication cost and can be achieved by using a specific rate SWC and shortest path routing. Theoretically, achieving optimality may require global knowledge of the data correlation structure, which may not be available in practice. Therefore, we propose a simple, hierarchical scheme that primarily exploits data correlation between local neighboring nodes. We show that for several correlation structures and topologies, the communication cost achieved by this scheme is within a constant factor of the distance entropy, i.e., it is asymptotically optimal. Finally, we simulate our algorithm using radar reffectivity data as well as traces from Gaussian Markov Fields (GMF). As the network size goes large, for the radar data, we find our algorithm saves two thirds of the communication cost compared to a non-coding approach; as for the GMF data, our algorithm converges to a constant factor (1 .5_1.8) the distance entropy.

Fast and reliable estimation schemes in RFID systems
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
RFID tags are being used in many diverse applications in increasingly large numbers. These capabilities of these tags span from very dumb passive tags to smart active tags, with the cost of these tags correspondingly ranging from a few pennies to many dollars. One of the common problems that arise in any RFID deployment is the problem of quick estimation of the number of tags in the field up to a desired level of accuracy. Prior work in this area has focused on the identification of tags, which needs more time, and is unsuitable for many situations, especially where the tag set is dense. We take a different, more practical approach, and provide very fast and reliable estimation mechanisms. In particular, we analyze our estimation schemes and show that the time needed to estimate the number of tags in the system for a given accuracy is much better than schemes presented in related work. We show that one can estimate the cardinality of tag-sets of any size in near-constant time, for a given accuracy of estimation.

Low-cost communication for rural internet kiosks using mechanical backhaul
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Rural kiosks in developing countries provide a variety of services such as birth, marriage, and death certificates, electricity bill collection, land records, email services, and consulting on medical and agricultural problems. Fundamental to a kiosk's operation is its connection to the Internet. Network connectivity today is primarily provided by dialup telephone, although Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) or long-distance wireless links are also being deployed. These solutions tend to be both expensive and failure prone. Instead, we propose the use of buses and cars as "mechanical backhaul" devices to carry data to and from a village and an internet gateway. Building on the pioneering lead of Daknet [15], and extending the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group architecture [24], we describe a comprehensive solution, encompassing naming, addressing, forwarding, routing, identity management, application support, and security. We believe that this architecture not only meets the top-level goals of low cost and robustness, but also exposes fundamental architectural principles necessary for any such design. We also describe our experiences in implementing a prototype of this architecture.

Coverage and connectivity in three-dimensional networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
Although most wireless terrestrial networks are based on two-dimensional (2D) design, in reality, such networks operate in three-dimensions (3D). Since most often the size (i.e., the length and the width) of such terrestrial networks is significantly larger than the differences in the third dimension (i.e., the height) of the nodes, the 2D assumption is somewhat justified and usually it does not lead to major inaccuracies. However, in some environments, this is not the case; the underwater, atmospheric, or space communications being such apparent examples. In fact, recent interest in underwater acoustic ad hoc and sensor networks hints at the need to understand how to design networks in 3D. Unfortunately, the design of 3D networks is surprisingly more difficult than the design of 2D networks. For example, proofs of Kelvin's conjecture and Kepler's conjecture required centuries of research to achieve breakthroughs, whereas their 2D counterparts are trivial to solve. In this paper, we consider the coverage and connectivity issues of 3D networks, where the goal is to find a node placement strategy with 100% sensing coverage of a 3D space, while minimizing the number of nodes required for surveillance. Our results indicate that the use of the Voronoi tessellation of 3D space to create truncated octahedral cells results in the best strategy. In this truncated octahedron placement strategy, the transmission range must be at least 1.7889 times the sensing range in order to maintain connectivity among nodes. If the transmission range is between 1.4142 and 1.7889 times the sensing range, then a hexagonal prism placement strategy or a rhombic dodecahedron placement strategy should be used. Although the required number of nodes in the hexagonal prism and the rhombic dodecahedron placement strategies is the same, this number is 43.25% higher than the number of nodes required by the truncated octahedron placement strategy. We verify by simulation that our placement strategies indeed guarantee ubiquitous coverage. We believe that our approach and our results presented in this paper could be used for extending the processes of 2D network design to 3D networks.

Hot topic: physical-layer network coding
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired network is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may reach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other nodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as an interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE 802.11). The goal of this paper is to show how the concept of network coding can be applied at the physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting advantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among nodes. In contrast to "straightforward" network coding which performs coding arithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves for equivalent coding operation. PNC can yield higher capacity than straight-forward network coding when applied to wireless networks. We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based network coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for boosting network capacity. PNC opens up a whole new research area because of its implications and new design requirements for the physical, MAC, and network layers of ad hoc wireless stations. The resolution of the many outstanding but interesting issues in PNC may lead to a revolutionary new paradigm for wireless ad hoc networking.

Improving spatial reuse through tuning transmit power, carrier sense threshold, and data rate in multihop wireless networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
The importance of spatial reuse in wireless ad-hoc networks has been long recognized as a key to improving the network capacity. One can increase the level of spatial reuse by either reducing the transmit power or increasing the carrier sense threshold (thereby reducing the carrier sense range). On the other hand, as the transmit power decreases or the carrier sense threshold increases, the SINR decreases as a result of the smaller received signal or the increased interference level. Consequently, the data rate sustained by each transmission may decrease. This leads naturally to the following questions:(1)How can the trade-off between the increased level of spatial reuse and the decreased data rate each node can sustain be quantified? In other words,is there an optimal range of transmit power/carrier sense threshold in which the network capacity is maximized? (2)What is the relation between the transmit power and the carrier sense threshold.In this paper, we study both problems, and show that (i)in the case that the achievable channel rate follows the Shannon capacity, spatial reuse depends only on the ratio of the transmit power to the carrier sense threshold; and (ii) in the case that only a set of discrete data rates are available, tuning the transmit power offers several advantages that tuning the carrier sense threshold cannot, provided that there is a sufficient number of power levels available. Based on the findings, we then propose a decentralized power and rate control algorithm to enable each node to adjust, based on its signal interference level, its transmit power and data rate. The transmit power is so determined that the transmitter can sustain a high data rate, while keeping the adverse interference effect on the other neighboring concurrent transmissions minimal. Simulation results have shown that, as compared to existing carrier sense threshold tuning algorithms, the proposed power and rate control algorithm yields higher network capacity.

Component based channel assignment in single radio, multi-channel ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
In this paper, we consider the channel assignment problem in single radio multi-channel mobile ad-hoc networks. Specifically, we investigate the granularity of channel assignment decisions that gives the best trade-off in terms of performance and complexity. We present a new granularity for channel assignment that we refer to as component level channel assignment. The strategy is relatively simple, and is characterized by several impressive practical advantages. We also show that the theoretical performance of the component based channel assignment strategy does not lag significantly behind the optimal possible performance, and perhaps more importantly we show that when coupled with its several practical advantages, it significantly outperforms other strategies under most network conditions.

On delivery guarantees of face and combined greedy-face routing in ad hoc and sensor networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
It was recently reported that all known face and combined greedy-face routing variants cannot guarantee message delivery in arbitrary undirected planar graphs. The purpose of this article is to clarify that this is not the truth in general. We show that specifically in relative neighborhood and Gabriel graphs recovery from a greedy routing failure is always possible without changing between any adjacent faces. Guaranteed delivery then follows from guaranteed recovery while traversing the very first face. In arbitrary graphs, however, a proper face selection mechanism is of importance since recovery from a greedy routing failure may require visiting a sequence of faces before greedy routing can be restarted again. A prominent approach is to visit a sequence of faces which are intersected by the line connecting the source and destination node. Whenever encountering an edge which is intersecting with this line, the critical part is to decide if face traversal has to change to the next adjacent one or not. Failures may occur from incorporating face routing procedures that force to change the traversed face at each intersection. Recently observed routing failures which were produced by the GPSR protocol in arbitrary planar graphs result from incorporating such a face routing variant. They cannot be constructed by the well known GFG algorithm which does not force changing the face anytime. Beside methods which visit the faces intersected by the source destination line, we discuss face routing variants which simply restart face routing whenever the next face has to be explored. We give the first complete and formal proofs that several proposed face routing, and combined greedyface routing schemes do guarantee delivery in specific graph classes or even any arbitrary planar graphs. We also discuss the reasons why other methods may fail to deliver a message or even end up in a loop.

OURS: optimal unicast routing systems in non-cooperative wireless networks
Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2006
We propose novel solutions for unicast routing in wireless networks consisted of selfish terminals: in order to alleviate the inevitable over-payment problem (and thus economic inefficiency) of the VCG (Vickrey-Clark-Groves) mechanism, we design a mechanism that results in Nash equilibria rather than the traditional strate-gyproofness (using weakly dominant strategy). In addition, we systematically study the unicast routing system in which both the relay terminals and the service requestor (either the source or the destination nodes or both) could be selfish. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents social efficient unicast routing systems with proved performance guarantee. Thus, we call the proposed systems: Optimal Unicast Routing Systems (OURS).Our main contributions of OURS are as follows. (1) For the principal model where the service requestor is not selfish, we propose a mechanism that provably creates incentives for intermediate terminals to cooperate in forwarding packets for others. Our mechanism substantially reduces the overpayment by using Nash equilibrium solutions as opposed to strategyproof solutions. We then study a more realistic case where the service requestor can act selfishly. (2) We first show that if we insist on the requirement of strategyproofness for the relay terminals, then no system can guarantee that the central authority can retrieve at least 1overn of the total payment. (3) We then present a strategyproof unicast system that collects 1over2n of the total payment, which is thus asymptotically optimum. (4) By only requiring Nash Equilibrium solutions, we propose a system that creates incentives for the service requestor and intermediate terminals to correctly follow the prescribed protocol. More importantly, the central authority can retrieve at least half the total payment. We verify the economic efficiency of our systems through simulations that are based on very realistic terminal distributions.

The geometry of mobility
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Mobility in networks arises both as mobility of packets and mobility of nodes. In a wireless setting, packets move under network control to meet desiderata of low latency, high throughput, load-balancing, energy conservation, etc. Nodes, though, often move under the influence of forces unrelated to the network state, necessitating the continuous adaptation of supporting network structures. In order to understand how to best design such structures, it is important to study the stability of various network mechanisms under node motion, as well as under other kinds of variability in the network, such as wireless link volatility. Since networks are embedded in the physical world (sometimes in order to monitor this very world, as in sensor networks) and node motion happens under physical laws, geometric and topological methods can be useful in understanding global structures that can affect network performance. In this talk we give a number of examples of such methods, such as the use of kinetic data structures in clustering mobile nodes and the use of topological complexes for capturing the global structure of a static network with the goal of designing efficient routing protocols.

Superimposed code based channel assignment in multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Motivated by the observation that channel assignment for multiradio multi-channel mesh networks should support both unicast and local broadcast1, should be interference-aware, and should result in low overall switching delay, high throughput, and low overhead, we propose two flexible localized channel assignment algorithms based on s-disjunct superimposed codes. These algorithms support the local broadcast and unicast effectively, and achieve interference-free channel assignment under certain conditions. In addition, under the primary interference constraints2, the channel assignment algorithm for unicast can achieve 100% throughput with a simple scheduling algorithm such as the maximal weight independent set scheduling, and can completely avoid hidden/exposed terminal problems under certain conditions. Our algorithms make no assumptions on the underlying network and therefore are applicable to a wide range of MR-MC mesh network settings. We conduct extensive theoretical performance analysis to verify our design.

Optimal channel probing and transmission scheduling for opportunistic spectrum access
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
In this study we consider optimal opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) policies for a transmitter in a multichannel wireless system, where a channel can be in one of multiple states. Each channel state is associated with either a probability of transmission success or a transmission rate. In such systems, the transmitter typically has partial information concerning the channel states, but can deduce more by probing individual channels, e.g. by sending control packets in the channels, at the expense of certain resources, e.g., energy and time. The main goal of this work is to derive optimal strategies for determining which channels to probe (in what sequence) and which channel to use for transmission. We consider two problems within this context,allthe constant data time (CDT) and the constant access time (CAT) problems. For both problems, we derive key structural properties of the corresponding optimal strategy. In particular, we show that it has a threshold structure and can be described by an index policy. We further show that the optimal CDT strategy can only take on one of three structural forms. Using these results we present a two-step lookahead CDT (CAT) strategy. This strategy is shown to be optimal for a number of cases of practical interest. We examine its performance under a class of practical channel models via numerical studies.

Trade-offs between mobility and density for coverage in wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
In this paper, we study the coverage problem for hybrid networks which comprise both static and mobile sensors. We consider mobile sensors with limited mobility, i.e., they can move only once over a short distance. Such mobiles are simple and cheap compared to sophisticated mobile robots. In conventional static sensor networks, for a random deployment, the sensor density should increase as O(log L + k log log L) to provide k-coverage in a network with a size of L. As an alternative, an all mobile sensor network can provide k-coverage over the field with a constant density of O(k), independent of network size L. We show that the maximum distance that any mobile sensor will have to move is O(1 over &#8730;k log 3 over 4 (kL)). We then propose a hybrid network structure, comprising static sensors and a small fraction of O(1 over &#8730;(k)) of mobile sensors. For this network structure, we prove that k-coverage is achievable with a constant sensor density of O(k), independent of network size L. Furthermore, for this hybrid structure, we prove that the maximum distance which any mobile sensor has to move is bounded as O(log3 over 4 L). We then propose a distributed relocation algorithm, where each mobile sensor only requires local information in order to optimally relocate itself and characterize the algorithm's computational complexity and message overhead. Finally, we verify our analysis via extensive numerical evaluations.

Rendered path: range-free localization in anisotropic sensor networks with holes
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Sensor positioning is a crucial part of many location-dependent applications that utilize wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Current localization approaches can be divided into two groups: range-based and range-free. Due to the high costs and critical as-sumptions, the range-based schemes are often impractical for WSNs. The existing range-free schemes, on the other hand, suffer from poor accuracy and low scalability. Without the help of a large number of uniformly deployed seed nodes, those schemes fail in anisotropic WSNs with possible holes. To address this issue, we propose the Rendered Path (REP) protocol. To the best of our knowledge, REP is the only range-free protocol for locating sen-sors with constant number of seeds in anisotropic sensor net-works.

Designing localized algorithms for barrier coverage
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Global barrier coverage that requires much fewer sensors than full coverage, is known to be an appropriate model of coverage for movement detection applications such as intrusion detection. However, it has been proved that given a sensor deployment, sensors can not locally determine whether the deployment provides global barrier coverage, making it impossible to develop localized algorithms, thus limiting its use in practice. In this paper, we introduce the concept of local barrier coverage to address this limitation. Motivated by the observation that movements are likely to follow a shorter path in crossing a belt region, local barrier coverage guarantees the detection of all movements whose trajectory is confined to a slice of the belt region of deployment. We prove that it is possible for individual sensors to locally determine the existence of local barrier coverage, even when the region of deployment is arbitrarily curved. Although local barrier coverage does not always guarantee global barrier coverage, we show that for thin belt regions, local barrier coverage almost always provides global barrier coverage. To demonstrate that local barrier coverage can be used to design localized algorithms, we develop a novel sleep-wakeup algorithm for maximizing the network lifetime, called Localized Barrier Coverage Protocol (LBCP). We show that LBCP provides close to optimalenhancement in network lifetime, while providing global barrier coverage most of the time. It outperforms an existing algorithm called Randomized Independent Sleeping (RIS) by up to 6 times.

Reliable density estimates for coverage and connectivity in thin strips of finite length
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Deriving the critical density (which is equivalent to deriving the critical radius or power) to achieve coverage and/or connectivity for random deployments is a fundamental problem in the area of wireless networks. The probabilistic conditions normally derived, however, have limited appeal among practitioners because they areoften asymptotic, i.e., they only make high probability guarantees in the limit of large system sizes. Such conditions are not very useful in practice since deployment regions are always finite. Another major limitation of most existing work on coverage and connectivity is their focus on thick deployment regions (such as a square or a disk). There is no existing work (including traditional percolation theory) that derives critical densities for thin strips (or annuli). In this paper, we address both of these shortcomings by introducing new techniques for deriving reliable density estimates for finite regions (including thin strips). We apply our techniques to solve the open problem of deriving reliable density estimates for achieving barrier coverage and connectivity in thin strips, where sensors are deployed as a barrier to detect moving objects and phenomena. We use simulations to show that our estimates are accurate even for small deployment regions. Our techniques bridge the gap between theory and practice in the area of coverage and connectivity, since the results can now be readily used in real-life deployments.

DARWIN: distributed and adaptive reputation mechanism for wireless ad-hoc networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Mobile ad-hoc networks are deployed under the assumption that participating nodes are willing to forward other nodes' packets. In reputation-based mechanisms cooperation is induced by means of a threat of partial or total disconnection from the network if a node is non-cooperative; however packet collisions and interference may make cooperative nodes appear selfish sometimes. In this paper we use a simple network model to first study the performance of some proposed reputation strategies and then present a new mechanism that we call DARWIN (Distributed and Adaptive Reputation mechanism for WIreless ad-hoc Networks). The idea is to avoid a retaliation situation after a node has been falsely perceived as selfish so cooperation can be restored quickly. We prove that our strategy is robust to imperfect measurements, is collusion-resistant and can achieve full cooperation among nodes.

802.11 user fingerprinting
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
The ubiquity of 802.11 devices and networks enables anyone to track our every move with alarming ease. Each 802.11 device transmits a globally unique and persistent MAC address and thus is trivially identifiable. In response, recent research has proposed replacing such identifiers with pseudonyms (i.e., temporary, unlinkable names). In this paper, we demonstrate that pseudonyms are insufficient to prevent tracking of 802.11 devices because implicit identifiers, or identifying characteristics of 802.11 traffic, can identify many users with high accuracy. For example, even without unique names and addresses, we estimate that an adversary can identify 64% of users with 90% accuracy when they spend a day at a busy hot spot. We present an automated procedure based on four previously unrecognized implicit identifiers that can identify users in three real 802.11 traces even when pseudonyms and encryption are employed. We find that the majority of users can be identified using our techniques, but our ability to identify users is not uniform; some users are not easily identifiable. Nonetheless, we show that even a single implicit identifier is sufficient to distinguish many users. Therefore, we argue that design considerations beyond eliminating explicit identifiers (i.e., unique names and addresses), must be addressed in order to prevent user tracking in wireless networks.

Robust location distinction using temporal link signatures
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
The ability of a receiver to determine when a transmitter has changed location is important for energy conservation in wireless sensor networks, for physical security of radio-tagged objects, and for wireless network security in detection of replication attacks. In this paper, we propose using a measured temporal link signature to uniquely identify the link between a transmitter and a receiver. When the transmitter changes location, or if an attacker at a different location assumes the identity of the transmitter, the proposed link distinction algorithm reliably detects the change in the physical channel. This detection can be performed at a single receiver or collaboratively by multiple receivers. We record over 9,000 link signatures at different locations and over time to demonstrate that our method significantly increases the detection rate and reduces the false alarm rate, in comparison to existing methods.

Mining call and mobility data to improve paging efficiency in cellular networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Locating mobile users and devices efficiently is a critical operation in cellular networks. This is done using a combination of location update(by the mobile) and paging (by the network). The paging scheme determines how and where to search for a mobile user given the latestlocation update information from that user. In this paper, we considerhow to increase the efficiency of the paging scheme. Much previous work has relied on simulation or modeling to design and evaluate the performance of proposed paging schemes. We take a different, data-driven approach in how we design and evaluate our solution. Specifically, we mine more than 300 million call records from a large cellular operator to characterize user mobility and create mobility profiles. We then develop a family ofprofile-based paging techniques, considering both static schemes and dynamic schemes which adapt as user profiles continuously get updated. We find that our paging techniques can dramatically reducesignaling load (up to 80%) with minimal increase in paging delay (usually less than 10%).

Adaptive network coding and scheduling for maximizing throughput in wireless networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Recently, network coding emerged as a promising technology that can provide significant improvements in throughput and energy efficiency of wireless networks, even for unicast communication. Often, network coding schemes are designed as an autonomous layer, independent of the underlying Phy and MAC capabilities and algorithms.Consequently, these schemes are greedy, in the sense that all opportunities of broadcasting combinations of packets are exploited. We demonstrate that this greedy design principle may in fact reduce the network throughput. This begets the need for adaptive network coding schemes. We further show that designing appropriate MAC scheduling algorithms is critical for achieving the throughput gainsexpected from network coding. In this paper, we propose a general framework to develop optimal and adaptive joint network coding and scheduling schemes. Optimality is shown for various Phy and MAC constraints. We apply this framework to two different network coding architectures: COPE, a scheme recently proposed in [7], and XOR-Sym, a new scheme we present here. XOR-Sym is designed to achieve a lower implementation complexity than that of COPE, and yet to provide similar throughput gains.

Beyond the bits: cooperative packet recovery using physical layer information
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Users increasingly depend on WLAN for business and entertainment. However, they occasionally experience dead spots and high loss rates. We show that these problems can be addressed by exposing information readily available at the physical layer. We make the physical layer convey its confidence that a particular bit is "0" or "1" to the higher layers. Access points that hear the same transmission communicate their confidence values over the wired Ethernet and combine their information to correct faulty bits in a corrupted packet. A single receiver may also combine the confidence estimates from multiple faulty retransmissions to obtain a correct packet. We implement our design and evaluate it using GNU software radios. The results show that our approach reduces loss rate by up to 10x in comparison with the current approach, and significantly outperforms prior packet combining proposals.

Crossing over the bounded domain: from exponential to power-law inter-meeting time in MANET
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Inter-meeting time between mobile nodes is one of the key metrics in a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) and central to the end-to-end delay and forwarding algorithms. It is typically assumed to be exponentially distributed in many performance studies of MANET or numerically shown to be exponentially distributed under most existing mobility models in the literature. However, recent empirical results show otherwise: the inter-meeting time distribution in fact follows a power-law. This outright discrepancy potentially undermines our understanding of the performance tradeoffs in MANET obtained under the exponential distribution ofthe inter-meeting time, and thus calls for further study on the power-law inter-meeting time including its fundamental cause, mobility modeling, and its effect. In this paper, we rigorously prove that a finite domain, on which most of the current mobility models are defined, plays an important role in creating the exponential tail of the inter-meeting time. We also prove that by simply removing the boundary in a simple two-dimensional isotropic random walk model, we are able to obtain the empirically observed power-law decay of the inter-meeting time. We then discuss the relationship between the size of the boundary and the relevant time scale of the network scenario under consideration. Our results thus provide guidelines on the design of new mobility models with power-law inter-meeting time distribution, new protocols including packet forwarding algorithms, as well as their performance analysis.

A general model of wireless interference
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
We develop a general model to estimate the throughput and goodput between arbitrary pairs of nodes in the presence of interference from other nodes in a wireless network. Our model is based on measurements from the underlying network itself and is thus more accurate than abstract models of RF propagation such as those based on distance. The seed measurements are easy to gather, requiring only O(N) measurements in an N-node networks. Compared to existing measurement-based models, our model advances the state of the art in three important ways. First, it goes beyond pairwise interference and models interference among an arbitrary number of senders. Second, it goes beyond broadcast transmissions and models the more common case of unicast transmissions. Third, it goes beyond homogeneous nodes and models the general case of heterogeneous nodes with different traffic demands and different radio characteristics. Using simulations and measurements from two different wireless testbeds, we show that the predictions of our model are accurate in a wide range of scenarios.

Power law and exponential decay of inter contact times between mobile devices
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
We examine the fundamental properties that determine the basic performance metrics for opportunistic communications. We first consider the distribution of inter-contact times between mobile devices. Using a diverse set of measured mobility traces, we find as an invariant property that there is a characteristic time, order of half a day, beyond which the distribution decays exponentially. Up to this value, the distribution in many cases follows a power law, as shown in recent work. This powerlaw finding was previously used to support the hypothesis that inter-contact time has a power law tail, and that common mobility models are not adequate. However, we observe that the time scale of interest for opportunistic forwarding may be of the same order as the characteristic time, and thus the exponential tail is important. We further show that already simple models such as random walk and random way point can exhibit the same dichotomy in the distribution of inter-contact time ascin empirical traces. Finally, we perform an extensive analysis of several properties of human mobility patterns across several dimensions, and we present empirical evidence that the return time of a mobile device to its favorite location site may already explain the observed dichotomy. Our findings suggest that existing results on the performance of forwarding schemes basedon power-law tails might be overly pessimistic.

Study of a bus-based disruption-tolerant network: mobility modeling and impact on routing
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
We study traces taken from UMass DieselNet, a Disruption-Tolerant Network consisting of WiFi nodes attached to buses. As buses travel their routes, they encounter other buses and in some cases are able to establish pair-wise connections and transfer data between them. We analyze the bus-to-bus contact traces to characterize the contact process between buses and its impact on DTN routing performance. We find that the all-bus-pairs aggregated inter-contact times show no discernible pattern. However, the inter-contact times aggregated at a route level exhibit periodic behavior.Based on analysis of the deterministic inter-meeting times for bus pairs running on route pairs, and consideration of the variability in bus movement and the random failures to establish connections, we construct generative route-level models that capture the above behavior. Through trace-driven simulations of epidemic routing, we find that the epidemic performance predicted by traces generated with this finer-grained route-level model is much closer to the actual performance that would be realized in the operational system than traces generated using the coarse-grained all-bus-pairs aggregated model. This suggests the importance in choosing the rightlevel of model granularity when modelingmobility-related measures such as inter-contact times in DTNs.

Challenges: towards truly scalable ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
The protocols used in ad hoc networks today are based on the assumption that the best way to approach multiple access interference (MAI) is to avoid it. Unfortunately, as the seminal work by Gupta and Kumar has shown, this approach does not scale. Recently, Ahlswede, Ning, Li, and Yeung showed that network coding (NC) can attain the max-flow min-cut throughput for multicast applications in directed graphs with point-to-point links. Motivated by this result, many researchers have attempted to make ad hoc networks scale using NC. However, the work by Liu, Goeckel, and Towsley has shown that NC does not increase the order capacity of wireless ad hoc networks for multi-pair unicast applications. We demonstrate that protocol architectures that exploit multi-packet reception (MPR) do increase the order capacity of random wireless ad hoc networks by a factor &#920;(log n) under the protocol model. We also show that MPR provides a better capacity improvement for ad hoc networks than NC when the network experiences a single-source multicast and multi-pair unicasts. Based on these results, we introduce design problems for channel access and routing based on MPR, such that nodes communicate with one another on a many-to-many basis, rather than one-to-one as it is done today, in order to make ad hoc networks truly scalable.

Challenge: peers on wheels - a road to new traffic information systems
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
In the context of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), a number of highly promising convenience applications have been proposed. These include collecting and distributing information on the traffic situation, distributed monitoring of road and weather conditions, and finding available parking places in a distributed, cooperative manner. Unfortunately, all of these applications face major problems when a VANET is used as a means to distribute the required information. In particular a large number of vehicles needs to be equipped with dedicated VANET technology before these applications can provide a useful service. Even if customers were willing to purchase a system which is not immediately useful, it would still take quite some time until the required density of equipped cars is reached. In contrast, affordable always-on mobile Internet access is already mainstream. Such Internet connectivity could be used to build the proposed applications in a different fashion: by using peer-to-peer communication, essentially creating a peer-to-peer network of cars sharing traffic information. This allows to overcome the limitations of VANETs, while it preserves their key benefits of decentralization and robustness. In this paper, we describe the technical challenges that arise from such an approach, point out relevant research directions, and outline possible starting points for solutions.

Challenges: device-free passive localization for wireless environments
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Typical location determination systems require the presence of a physical device that is attached to the person that is being tracked. In addition, they usually require the tracked device to participate actively in the localization process. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Device-free Passive (DfP) localization. A DfP system is envisioned to be able to detect, track, and identify entities that do not carry any device, nor participate actively in the localization process. The system works by monitoring and processing changes in the received physical signals at one or more monitoring points to detect changes in the environment. Applications for DfP systems include intrusion detection and tracking, protecting outdoor assets, such as pipelines, railroad tracks, and perimeters. We describe the DfP system's architecture and the challenges that need to be addressed to materialize a DfP system. We show the feasibility of the system by describing algorithms for implementing different functionalities of a DfP system that works with nominal WiFi equipment. We present two techniques for intrusion detection and a technique for tracking a single intruder. Our results show that the system can achieve very high probability of detection and tracking with very few false positives. We also identify different research directions for addressing the challenges of realizing a DfP system.

Adaptive contact probing mechanisms for delay tolerant applications
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
In many delay tolerant applications, information is opportunistically exchanged between mobile devices who encounter each other. In order to effect such information exchange, mobile devices must have knowledge of other devices in their vicinity. We consider scenarios in which there is no infrastructure and devices must probe their environment to discover other devices. This can be an extremely energy consuming process and highlights the need for energy conscious contact probing mechanisms. If devices probe very infrequently, they might miss many of their contacts. On the other hand, frequent contact probing might be energy inefficient. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between the probability of missing a contact and the contact probing frequency. First, via theoretical analysis, we characterize the trade-off between the probability of a missed contact and the contact probing interval for stationary processes. Next, for time varying contact arrival rates, we provide an optimization framework to compute the optimal contact probing interval as a function of the arrival rate. We characterize real world contact patterns via Bluetooth phone contact logging experiments and show that the contact arrival process is self-similar. We design STAR, a contact probing algorithm which adapts to the contact arrival process. Via trace driven simulations on our experimental data, we show that STAR consumes three times less energy when compared to a constant contact probing interval scheme.

A measurement-based approach to modeling link capacity in 802.11-based wireless networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
We present a practical, measurement-based model that captures the effect of interference in 802.11-based wireless LAN or mesh networks. The goal is to model capacity of any given link in the presence of any given number of interferers in a deployed network, carrying any specified amount of offered load. Central to our modeling approach is a MAC-layer model for 802.11 that is fed by PHY-layer models for deferral and packet capture behaviors, which in turn are profiled based on measurements. The target network to be evaluated needs only O(N) measurement steps to gather metrics for individual links that seed the models. We provide two solution approaches - one based on direct simulation (slow, but accurate) and the other based on analytical methods (faster, but approximate). We present elaborate validation results for a 12 node 802.11b mesh network using upto 5 interfering transmissions. We demonstrate, using as comparison points three simpler modeling approaches, that the accuracy of our approach is much better, predicting link capacities with errors within 10% of the base channel datarate for about 90% of the cases.

MDG: measurement-driven guidelines for 802.11 WLAN design
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Dense deployments of WLANs suffer from increased interference and as a result, reduced capacity. There are three main functions used to improve the overall network capacity: a) intelligent frequency allocation across APs, b) load-balancing of user affiliations across APs, and c) adaptive power-control for each AP. Several algorithms have been proposed in each category, but so far, their evaluation has been limited to: (a) each approach in isolation and, (b)simulations or small-scale testbeds. In this paper, we ask the question: what is the best way to combine these different functions? Our focus is to fully explore the interdependencies between the three functions in order to understand when and how to deploy them on a network. We follow a measurement-driven study to quantify the effects of three previously proposed optimization schemes (one for each category) on a relatively large testbed and in many different scenarios. Surprisingly, we find that blindly applying all the three optimization schemes is not always preferable; it can sometimes degrade the performance by as much as 24% compared to using only two of the schemes. We discover that there are explicit conditions that are conducive for applying specific combinations of the optimization schemes. We capture those conditions within a comprehensive framework, which we call MDG (Measurement-Driven Guidelines). While we derive suchguidelines based on measurements on one experimental testbed, we test their applicability and efficacy on a second testbed in a different location. We show that our framework improves network capacity consistently acrossboth testbeds, with improvements ranging from 22% to 142% with 802.11a, and 103% to 274% with 802.11g.

Multicast capacity for large scale wireless ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
In this paper, we study the capacity of a large-scale random wireless network for multicast.Assume that n wireless nodes are randomly deployed in a square region with side-length a and all nodes have the uniform transmission range r and uniform interference range R &#62;r. We further assume that each wireless node can transmit/receive at W bits/second over a common wireless channel. For each node v<sub>i</sub>, we randomly pick k-1 nodes from the other n-1 nodes as the receivers of the multicast session rooted at node v<sub>i</sub>. The aggregated multicast capacity is defined as the total data rate of all multicast sessions in the network. In this paper we derive matching asymptotic upper bounds and lower bounds on multicast capacity of random wireless networks. We show that the total multicast capacity is &#920;(&#8730;n over log n dot W over &#8730; k) when k = &#937;(n over log n); the total multicast capacity is &#920;(W) when k =&#920;(n over log n). Our bounds unify the previous capacity bounds on unicast (when k=2) by Gupta and Kumar [7]and the capacity bounds on broadcast (when k=n) in [11,20]. We also study the capacity of group-multicast for wireless networks where for each source node, we randomly select k-1 groups of nodes as receivers and the nodes in each group are within a constant hops from the group leader. The same asymptotic upper bounds and lower bounds still hold. For arbitrary networks, we provide a constructive lower bound &#937;(&#8730;n over &#8730;k dot W) for aggregated multicast capacity when we can carefully place nodes and schedule node transmissions.

On designing collusion-resistant routing schemes for non-cooperative wireless ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
In wireless ad hoc networks, routing requires cooperation of nodes. Since nodes often belong to different users, it is highly important to provide incentives for them to cooperate. However, most existing studies of the incentive-compatible routing problem focus on individual nodes' incentives, assuming that no subset of them would collude. Clearly, this assumption is not always valid. In this paper, we present a systematic study of collusion resistance in incentive-compatible routing schemes. In particular, we consider two standard solution concepts for collusion resistance in game theory, namely Group Strategyproofness and Strong Nash Equilibrium. We show that achieving Group Strategyproofness is impossible while achieving Strong Nash Equilibrium is possible. More specifically, we design a scheme that is guaranteed to converge to a Strong Nash Equilibrium. In addition, we give a cryptographic method that prevents profit transfer between colluding nodes, as long as they do not fullytrust each other unconditionally. This method makes our scheme widely applicable in practice. Experiments show that our solution is collusion-resistant and has good performance.

Weak state routing for large scale dynamic networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Routing in communication networks involves the indirection from a persistent name (or ID) to a locator and delivering packets based upon the locator. In a large-scale, highly dynamic network, the ID-to-locator mappings are both large in number, and change often. Traditional routing protocols require high overhead to keep these in directions up-to-date. In this paper, we propose Weak State Routing (WSR), a routing mechanism for large-scale highly dynamic networks. WSR's novelty is that it uses random directional walks biased occasionally by weak indirection state information in intermediate nodes. The indirection state information is weak, i.e. interpreted not as absolute truth, but as probabilistic hints. Nodes only have partial information about the region a destination node is likely to be. This method allows us to aggregate information about a number of remote locations in a geographic region. In other words, the state information maps a set-of-IDs to a it geographical region. The intermediate nodes receiving the random walk use a method similar to longest-prefix-match in order to prioritize their mappings to decide how to bias and forward the random walk. WSR can also be viewed as an unstructured distributed hashing technique. WSR displays good rare-object recall with scalability properties similar to structured DHTs, albeit with more tolerance to dynamism and without constraining the degree distribution of the underlying network. Through simulations, we show that WSR offers a high packet delivery ratio, more than 98%. The control packet overhead incurred in the network scales as O(N) for N-node networks. The number of mappings stored in the network appears to scale as &#920;(N(3/2)). We compare WSR with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and geographic forwarding (GPSR) combined with Grid Location Service (GLS). Our results indicate that WSR delivers more packets with less overhead at the cost of increased path length.

Revisiting minimum cost reliable routing in wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
We revisit the problem of computing the path with the minimum cost in terms of the expected number of link layer retransmissions in wireless mesh networks. Unlike previous efforts (such as the popular ETX) we account for the fact that link layer protocols (such as the IEEE 802.11 MAC) incorporate a non-zero but finite number of retransmission attempts per packet. A key observation that motivates this work is that the performance of a path depends not only on the number of links on the path and their qualities, but also on the relative positions of the links on the path. In particular, the closer a lossy link to the destination, the higher is its impact on the performance of that path. We design a new path metricthat captures all of the above factors and we call this metric ETOP. In this paper, we provide a synopsis of the analytical computation of ETOP. We also implement a routing strategy based on ETOP on a 25-node experimental testbed and provide sample results to showcase the performance with ETOP.

Practical network coding in wireless networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Network coding is seen as a promising technique to improve network throughput. In this paper, we study two important problems in localized network coding in wireless networks, which only requires each node to know about and coordinate with one-hop neighbors. In particular, we first establish a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for useful coding to be possible. We show this condition is much weaker than expected, and hence allows a variety of coding schemes to suit different network conditions and application preferences. Based on the understanding we establish, we are able to design a robust coding technique called loop coding that can improve network throughput and TCP throughput simultaneously.

We propose SecNav, a new protocol for securing wireless navigation systems. This protocol secures localization and time synchronization in wireless networks by relying on devices' awareness of presence in the power-range (coverage area) of navigation stations. We perform a detailed security analysis of SecNav and show that, compared to existing secure navigation approaches, it prevents the widest range of attacks on navigation. Our implementation of SecNav, using 802.11b devices, shows that this scheme can be efficiently implemented with existing technologies.

Real-time implications of multiple transmission rates in wireless networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Wireless networks are increasingly being used for latency-sensitive applications that require data delivery to be timely, efficient and reliable. This trend is primarily driven by the proliferation of wireless networks of real-time data-gathering sensor-actuator devices. This has led to a strong need to bring real-time concerns to the forefront of an integrated research thrust into wireless real-time systems. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a specific instance of the rich set of problems in this domain. We consider a wireless network serving real-time flows in which the underlying physical layer provides multiple transmission rates. Higher rates have more stringent SINR requirements and thus represent a trade-off between raw transmission speed and packet error rate. We adopt a first principles approach to the design of optimal real-time scheduling algorithms for such a multi-rate wireless network. We illustrate the inherent complexities of the problem through examples and obtain provably optimal structural results. We then characterize the optimal policy for an approximate model. Our theoretical analysis provides guidelines for heuristic scheduler design. Our initial work indicates that this is a rich problem domain with the potential for a unifying theory that integrates real-time requirements into multi-rate wireless network design.

Towards context-aware wireless spectrum agility

2007
Spectrum agility (SA) is a novel way of improving spectrum utilization efficiency and making greater bandwidth available to network applications. Despite its advantages, the fundamental operations (e.g., periodic spectrum sensing) involved in realizing SA can also adversely affect application performance. We propose Context-Aware Spectrum Agility (CASA), which uses application hints together with the current channel condition to adapt key SA parameters. Our preliminary evaluation shows that CASA improves throughput by 35%, and is also more effective in meeting application demands than conventional SA.

Altruistic cooperation for energy-efficient multi-channel MAC protocols
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Recently, a new notion of cooperation was proposed to solve multi-channel coordination problems. When a transmit-receive pair wishes to initiate communication, neighboring nodes share their knowledge of channel usage. This helps to substantially reduce collisions and increases throughput significantly. However, it comes at the cost of increased energy consumption since idle nodes have to stay awake to overhear and acquire channel usage information. In fact this can be as high as 264% of a power-saving protocol without cooperation. In this paper, we propose a strategy called altruistic cooperation for cooperative multi-channel MAC protocols to conserve energy. The core idea is to introduce specialized nodes called altruists in the network whose only role is to acquire and share channel usage information. All other nodes, termed peers, go in to the sleep mode when idle. This strategy seems naive because it needs additional nodes to be deployed. In fact, it is unclear whether a desirable throughput-energy trade-off can be achieved and whether the cost of additional nodes can offset the performance gain. We perform a close study on this strategy in terms of three aspects: network deployment, cost efficiency, and system performance. Our study indicates that only a few additional nodes need to be deployed and cost efficiency is more than doubled in terms of a new metric called bit-price ratio that we propose. By using the strategy, a cooperative protocol is found to save up to 70% energy while not compromising throughput.

Self-healing multi-radio wireless mesh networks

None
2007
We present novel Localized sElf-reconfiGuration algOrithms (LEGO) for a multi-radio wireless mesh network to autonomously and effectively recover from wireless link failures. First, LEGO locally detects link failures by accurately monitoring the network condition and, upon detection of a failure, triggers network reconfiguration. Second, it dynamically forms/deforms a local group for cooperative network reconfiguration among local mesh routers in a fully-distributed manner. Next, LEGO intelligently generates a local network reconfiguration plan through which a thus-formed group recovers from local failures, while keeping network changes to minimum. Finally, by figuring local channel utilization and reconfiguration cost in its planning, LEGO maximizes the network's ability to meet diverse links' QoS demands. LEGO has been implemented on a Linux-based system and experimented on a reallife testbed, demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering from link failures and its improvement of channel efficiency by up to 92%.

Superposition coding for wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
A major barrier for the adoption of wireless mesh networks is severe limits on throughput. In this paper, we apply superposition coding to substantially improve network capacity of large, dense wireless mesh networks. Superposition coding is a physical layer technique that allows a transmitter to simultaneously send independent packets to multiple receivers. While superposition coding has been studied extensively by the physical layer community, we present the first design of practical and effective MAC protocols to take advantage of superposition coding in wireless mesh networks. Extensive evaluations show that superposition coding can be a practical method to increase the throughput of large, dense wireless mesh networks. Specifically, in a mesh network with 2 to 64 active receivers and one gateway, we show that our system can increase throughput up to 154%, with average gain ranging from 10% to 21%. When there are multiple gateways forming a mesh network, our system gains up to 98%, with average gain ranging from 24% to 46%. These results clearly demonstrate the potential benefits of our system. We also present results from an implementation of superposition coding using GNU Radio.

Authentication on the edge: distributed authentication for a global open wi-fi network

2007
A global-scale low cost outdoor Internet access infrastructure is finally attainable. Emerging projects are leveraging the proliferation of private Wi-Fi networks to build a global-scale ubiquitous access infrastructure from autonomous, independently owned Internet connections at homes and other private properties. To ensure the trace ability and accountability required by the broadband ISPs and private owners of these Wi-Fi networks, reliable authentication and authorization are needed. This paper describes authentication on the edge, a localized and distributed authentication method for open Wi-Fi networks. Three main ideas are used to adapt to the variability and unreliability of these networks: the use of certificate-based authentication, the distribution of a segmented certificate revocation list to all entities and the self organization of access points into a social lookup network. These methods achieve the scalability needed for the overwhelming size and volume of a global network and increase resiliency against temporary failures in the infrastructure.

Mining behavioral groups in large wireless LANs

None
2007
Recent years have witnessed significant growth in the adoption of portable wireless communication and computing devices (e.g., laptops, PDAs, smart phones) and large-scale deployment of wireless networks (e.g., cellular, WLANs). We envision that future usage of mobile devices and services will be highly personalized. Users will incorporate these new technologies into their daily lives, and the way they use new devices and services will reflect their personality and lifestyle. Therefore it is imperative to study and characterize the fundamental structure of wireless user behavior in order to model, manage, leverage and design efficient mobile networks and services. In this study, using our systematic TRACE approach, we analyze wireless users' behavioral patterns by extensively mining wireless network logs from two major university campuses. We represent the data using location-preference vectors, and utilize unsupervised learning (clustering) to classify trends in user behavior using novel similarity metrics. Matrix decomposition techniques are used to identify (and differentiate between) major patterns. We discover multi-modal user behavior and hundreds of distinct groups with unique behavioral patterns in both campuses, and their sizes follow a power-law distribution. Our methods and findings might provide new directions in network management and behavior-aware network protocols and applications, to name a few.

Interference mitigation in enterprise WLANs through speculative scheduling
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Wireless LANs are commonplace installations in enterprise environments. Their ease of use and deployment, however, are accompanied by a difficulty in their management and security. Proposed solutions to these problems are based on centralization; in the control plane through centralized authentication and allocation of channels and power levels, and in the data plane through time slotted medium access using centralized scheduling for interference mitigation. While centralization of some control plane tasks has been shown to be feasible, centralization on the data plane is significantly harder to realize. This is because it needs to take into account the inherent variability of the wireless medium while offering bounds on delay and jitter on the control paths. In this work, we present a study of the various problems that arise in centralization of the data plane in an enterprise WLAN. We believe that a pragmatic solution for data plane centralization is the key approachto provisioning an enterprise WLAN consisting of a dense deployment of APs.

Cross-layer jamming detection and mitigation in wireless broadcast networks
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Mobile communication systems are often susceptible to high level of noise injected by adversaries, known as jamming attack. Jamming is difficult to prevent in broadcast networks because a user that can decode a transmission can also jam the transmission. In this paper, we describe a code tree system that helps the physical layer circumvent jammers. This system works with any spread-spectrum communications system. In our system, the transmitter has more information than any single receiver. Each receiver cooperates with the transmitter to detect any jamming that affects that receiver. Our scheme mitigates the jamming attack while allowing the transmitter to transmit on fewer codes than the number of users. We simulated our system in a theoretical setting using MATLAB. The result shows significant improvement over naively transmitting on a single shared code.

Understanding the effect of access point density on wireless LAN performance
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
In this paper, we present a systematic experimental study of the effect of inter-cell interference on IEEE 802.11 performance. With increasing penetration of WiFi into residential areas and usage in ad hoc conference settings, chaotic unplanned deployments are becoming the norm rather than an exception. These networks often operate many nearby access points and stations on the same channel, either due to lack of coordination or insufficient available channels. Thus, inter-cell interference is common but not well-understood. According to conventional wisdom, the efficiency of an 802.11 network is determined by the number of active clients. Surprisingly, we find that with a typical TCP-dominant workload, cumulative system throughput is characterized by the number of interfering access points rather than the number of clients. We find that due to TCP flow control, the number of backlogged stations in such a network equals twice the number of access points. Thus, a single access point network proved very robust even with over one hundred clients. Multiple interfering access points, however, lead to an increase in collisions that reduces throughput and affects volume of traffic in the network.

Low-overhead channel-aware rate adaptation
Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2007
Current rate selection algorithms are dominated by probe-based approaches that search for the best transmission rate using trial-and-error. When operating over a dynamic channel, probe-based techniques can perform poorly since they inefficiently search for the moving target presented by the constantly changing channel. We have developed a channel-aware rate adaptation algorithm - CHARM - that responds quickly to dynamic channel changes, and significantly outperforms probe-based algorithms in many instances. Unlike previous approaches, CHARM leverages channel reciprocity to obtain channel information without incurring RTS/CTS overhead. Our work shows that channel-aware rate selection is viable, and can significantly outperform probe-based rate adaptation over both static and dynamic channels.

eBay in the Sky: strategy-proof wireless spectrum auctions
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Market-driven dynamic spectrum auctions can drastically improve the spectrum availability for wireless networks struggling to obtain additional spectrum. However, they face significant challenges due to the fear of market manipulation. A truthful or strategy-proof spectrum auction eliminates the fear by enforcing players to bid their true valuations of the spectrum. Hence bidders can avoid the expensive overhead of strategizing over others and the auctioneer can maximize its revenue by assigning spectrum to bidders who value it the most. Conventional truthful designs, however, either fail or become computationally intractable when applied to spectrum auctions. In this paper, we propose VERITAS, a truthful and computationally-efficient spectrum auction to support an eBay-like dynamic spectrum market. VERITAS makes an important contribution of maintaining truthfulness while maximizing spectrum utilization. We show analytically that VERITAS is truthful, efficient, and has a polynomial complexity of O(n3k) when n bidders compete for k spectrum bands. Simulation results show that VERITAS outperforms the extensions of conventional truthful designs by up to 200% in spectrum utilization. Finally, VERITAS supports diverse bidding formats and enables the auctioneer to reconfigure allocations for multiple market objectives.

In-band spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks: energy detection or feature detection?
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
In a cognitive radio network (CRN), in-band spectrum sensing is essential for the protection of legacy spectrum users, with which the presence of primary users (PUs) can be detected promptly, allowing secondary users (SUs) to vacate the channels immediately. For in-band sensing, it is important to meet the detectability requirements, such as the maximum allowed latency of detection (e.g., 2 seconds in IEEE 802.22) and the probability of mis-detection and false-alarm. In this paper, we propose an effcient periodic in-band sensing algorithm that optimizes sensing-frequency and sensing-time by minimizing sensing overhead while meeting the detectability requirements. The proposed scheme determines the better of energy or feature detection that incurs less sensing overhead at each SNR level, and derives the threshold aRSS<sub>threshold</sub> on the average received signal strength (RSS) of a primary signal below which feature detection is preferred. We showed that energy detection under lognormal shadowing could still perform well at the average SNR < SNR<sub>wall</sub> [1] when collaborative sensing is used for its location diversity. Two key factors affecting detection performance are also considered: noise uncertainty and inter-CRN interference. aRSS<sub>threshold</sub> appears to lie between -114.6 dBm and -109.9 dBm with the noise uncertainty ranging from 0.5 dB to 2 dB, and between -112.9 dBm and -110.5 dBm with 1~6 interfering CRNs.

Advancing wireless link signatures for location distinction
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Location distinction is the ability to determine when a device has changed its position. We explore the opportunity to use sophisticated PHY-layer measurements in wireless networking systems for location distinction. We first compare two existing location distinction methods - one based on channel gains of multi-tonal probes, and another on channel impulse response. Next, we combine the benefits of these two methods to develop a new link measurement that we call the complex temporal signature. We use a 2.4 GHz link measurement data set, obtained from CRAWDAD [10], to evaluate the three location distinction methods. We find that the complex temporal signature method performs significantly better compared to the existing methods. We also perform new measurements to understand and model the temporal behavior of link signatures over time. We integrate our model in our location distinction mechanism and significantly reduce the probability of false alarms due to temporal variations of link signatures.

Challenges: wide-area wirelesss NETworks (WANETs)
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
A WANET is a wireless network where the wireless nodes can be located anywhere over the globe. However, the underlying design is such that the nodes believe they are part of a single-hop or multi-hop wireless network at the PHY and MAC layers. This is accomplished by using Software Defined Access Points (SoDA) that are based on the idea of Software Defined Radio (SDR). For the uplink, each SoDA samples the down-converted channel using an ADC (analog-to-digital converter). The sampled data is then multicast to the other SoDAs via the Internet. At each end-point, the received digital signals from the other SoDAs are summed and sent through the DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and transmitted on a designated channel after upconversion. In effect what we have done is to mix the RF environment at geographically separate locations (albeit with a time shift). This simple technique leads to a whole new model for designing and using wireless networks. Indeed, we can think of these networks as following the end-to-end model where only the end nodes understand the PHY/MAC layers and the access points and Internet serve simply as dumb relays. This paper describes a series of network models that are enabled and outlines the open research challenges.

BreadCrumbs: forecasting mobile connectivity
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Mobile devices cannot rely on a single managed network, but must exploit a wide variety of connectivity options as they travel. We argue that such systems must consider the derivative of connectivity--the changes inherent in movement between separately managed networks, with widely varying capabilities. With predictive knowledge of such changes, devices can more intelligently schedule network usage. To exploit the derivative of connectivity, we observe that people are creatures of habit; they take similar paths every day. Our system, BreadCrumbs, tracks the movement of the device's owner, and customizes a predictive mobility model for that specific user. Combined with past observations of wireless network capabilities, BreadCrumbs generates connectivity forecasts. We have built a BreadCrumbs prototype, and demonstrated its potential with several weeks of real-world usage. Our results show that these forecasts are sufficiently accurate, even with as little as one week of training, to provide improved performance with reduced power consumption for several applications.

Media sharing based on colocation prediction in urban transport
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
People living in urban areas spend a considerable amount of time on public transport, for example, commuting to/from work. During these periods, opportunities for inter-personal networking present themselves, as many members of the public now carry electronic devices equipped with Bluetooth or other wireless technology. Using these devices, individuals can share content (e.g., music, news and video clips) with fellow travellers that are on the same train or bus. Transferring media content takes time; in order to maximise the chances of successful downloads, users should identify neighbours that possess desirable content and who will travel with them for long-enough periods. In this paper, we propose a user-centric prediction scheme that collects historical colocation information to determine the best content sources. The scheme works on the assumption that people have a high degree of regularity in their movements. We first validate this assumption on a real dataset, that consists of traces of people moving in a large city's mass transit system. We then demonstrate experimentally on these traces that our prediction scheme significantly improves communication efficiency, when compared to a memory(history)-less source selection scheme.

Enhancing interactive web applications in hybrid networks
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Mobile Internet users have several options today including high bandwidth cellular data services such as 3G, that may be the choice for many. However, the ubiquity and low cost of WiFi suggests an attractive alternative, namely, opportunistic use of open WiFi access points (APs) or planned municipal mesh networks. Unfortunately, for vehicular users, the intermittent nature of WiFi connectivity makes it challenging to support popular interactive applications such as Web search and browsing. Our work is driven by two questions. 1) How can we enable system support for interactive web applications to tolerate disruptions in WiFi connectivity from mobile nodes? 2) Can opportunistic mobile-to-mobile (m2m) transfers enhance application performance over only using APs, and if so, under what conditions and by how much? We present Thedu, a system that enables access to Web search from moving vehicles. The key idea is to use aggressive prefetching to transform the interactive Web search application into a one-shot request/response process. We deployed a prototype of Thedu on the DieselNet testbed in Amherst, MA, consisting of transit buses averaging 21 on the road at a time. Our deployment results show that Thedu can deliver 4 times as many relevant web pages than not using Thedu. A bus receives relevant web pages with a mean delay of 2.3 minutes and within 0.55 minutes in areas with high AP density. Thedu augments AP connectivity with m2m transfers using a utility-driven DTN routing algorithm and uses caching to exploit query locality. Our analytic model and trace-driven simulations suggest that m2m routing yields little benefit over using APs alone even under moderately dense AP deployment such as in Amherst. With sparsely deployed APs as may be the case in rural areas, our conclusions are more mixed: m2m routing with caching improves the number of relevant responses delivered per bus by up to 58%, but the mean delay is significantly high at 6.7 minutes, calling into question its practicality for interactive applications.

Relays, base stations, and meshes: enhancing mobile networks with infrastructure
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Networks composed of mobile nodes inherently suffer from intermittent connections and high delays. Performance can be improved by adding supporting infrastructure, including base stations, meshes, and relays, but the cost-performance trade-offs of different designs is poorly understood. To examine these trade-offs, we have deployed a large-scale vehicular network and three infrastructure enhancement alternatives. The results of these deployments demonstrate some of the advantages of each kind of infrastructure; however, these conclusions can be applied only to other networks of similar characteristics, including size, wireless technologies, and mobility patterns. Thus we complement our deployment with a demonstrably accurate analytical model of large-scale networks in the presence of infrastructure. Based on our deployment and analysis, we make several fundamental observations about infrastructure-enhanced mobile networks. First, if the average packet delivery delay in a vehicular deployment can be reduced by a factor of two by adding x base stations, the same reduction requires 2x mesh nodes or 5x relays. Given the high cost of deploying base stations, relays or mesh nodes can be a more cost-effective enhancement. Second, we observe that adding small amount of infrastructure is vastly superior to even a large number of mobile nodes capable of routing to one another, obviating the need for mobile-to-mobile disruption tolerant routing schemes.

GAnGS: gather, authenticate 'n group securely
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Establishing secure communication among a group of physically collocated people is a challenge. This problem can be reduced to establishing authentic public keys among all the participants - these public keys then serve to establish a shared secret symmetric key for encryption and authentication of messages. Unfortunately, in most real-world settings, public key infrastructures (PKI) are uncommon and distributing a secret in a public space is difficult. Thus, it is a challenge to exchange authentic public keys in a scalable, secure, and easy to use fashion. In this paper, we propose GAnGS, a protocol for the secure exchange of authenticated information among a group of people. In contrast to prior work, GAnGS resists Group-in-the-Middle and Sybil attacks by malicious insiders, as well as infiltration attacks by malicious bystanders. GAnGS is designed to be robust to user errors, such as miscounting the number of participants or incorrectly comparing checksums. We have implemented and evaluated GAnGS on Nokia N70 phones. The GAnGS system is viable and achieves a good balance between scalability, security, and ease of use.

On fast and accurate detection of unauthorized wireless access points using clock skews
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
We explore the use of clock skew of a wireless local area network access point (AP) as its fingerprint to detect unauthorized APs quickly and accurately. The main goal behind using clock skews is to overcome one of the major limitations of existing solutions - the inability to effectively detect Medium Access Control (MAC) address spoofing. We calculate the clock skew of an AP from the IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function (TSF) timestamps sent out in the beacon/probe response frames. We use two different methods for this purpose - one based on linear programming and the other based on least square fit. We supplement these methods with a heuristic for differentiating original packets from those sent by the fake APs. We collect TSF timestamp data from several APs in two different residential settings. Using our measurement data as well as data obtained from a large conference setting, we find that clock skews remain consistent over time for the same AP but vary significantly across APs. Furthermore, we improve the resolution of received timestamp of the frames and show that with this enhancement our methodology can find clock skews very quickly, using 50-100 packets in most of the cases. We also discuss and quantify the impact of various external factors including temperature variation, virtualization, and NTP synchronization on clock skews. Our results indicate that the use of clock skews appears to be an efficient and robust method for detecting fake APs in wireless local area networks.

Wireless device identification with radiometric signatures
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
We design, implement, and evaluate a technique to identify the source network interface card (NIC) of an IEEE 802.11 frame through passive radio-frequency analysis. This technique, called PARADIS, leverages minute imperfections of transmitter hardware that are acquired at manufacture and are present even in otherwise identical NICs. These imperfections are transmitter-specific and manifest themselves as artifacts of the emitted signals. In PARADIS, we measure differentiating artifacts of individual wireless frames in the modulation domain, apply suitable machine-learning classification tools to achieve significantly higher degrees of NIC identification accuracy than prior best known schemes. We experimentally demonstrate effectiveness of PARADIS in differentiating between more than 130 identical 802.11 NICs with accuracy in excess of 99%. Our results also show that the accuracy of PARADIS is resilient against ambient noise and fluctuations of the wireless channel. Although our implementation deals exclusively with IEEE 802.11, the approach itself is general and will work with any digital modulation scheme.

Radio-telepathy: extracting a secret key from an unauthenticated wireless channel
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Securing communications requires the establishment of cryptographic keys, which is challenging in mobile scenarios where a key management infrastructure is not always present. In this paper, we present a protocol that allows two users to establish a common cryptographic key by exploiting special properties of the wireless channel: the underlying channel response between any two parties is unique and decorrelates rapidly in space. The established key can then be used to support security services (such as encryption) between two users. Our algorithm uses level-crossings and quantization to extract bits from correlated stochastic processes. The resulting protocol resists cryptanalysis by an eavesdropping adversary and a spoofing attack by an active adversary without requiring an authenticated channel, as is typically assumed in prior information-theoretic key establishment schemes. We evaluate our algorithm through theoretical and numerical studies, and provide validation through two complementary experimental studies. First, we use an 802.11 development platform with customized logic that extracts raw channel impulse response data from the preamble of a format-compliant 802.11a packet. We show that it is possible to practically achieve key establishment rates of ~ 1 bit/sec in a real, indoor wireless environment. To illustrate the generality of our method, we show that our approach is equally applicable to per-packet coarse signal strength measurements using off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware.

Capacity of large scale wireless networks under Gaussian channel model
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2008
In this paper, we study the multicast capacity of a large scale random wireless network. We simply consider the extended multihop network, where a number of wireless nodes v<sub>i</sub>(1 &#8804; i &#8804; n) are randomly located in a square region with side-length a = &#8730;n, by use of Poisson distribution with density 1. All nodes transmit at constant power P, and the power decays along path, with attenuation exponent &#945; &#62; 2. The data rate of a transmission is determined by the SINR as B log(1 + SINR). There are n<sub>s</sub> randomly and independently chosen multicast sessions. Each multicast has k randomly chosen terminals. We show that, when k &#8804; &#952;<sub>1</sub> n/(log n)2&#945;+6, and n<sub>s</sub> &#8805; &#952;<sub>2</sub>n1/2+&#946;, the capacity that each multicast session can achieve, with high probability, is at least c<sub>8</sub>&#8730;n/n<sub>s</sub>&#8730;k, where &#952;<sub>1</sub>, &#952;<sub>2</sub>, and c<sub>8</sub> are some special constants and &#946; &#62; 0 is any positive real number. Our result generalizes the unicast capacity [3] for random networks using percolation theory.

ACES: adaptive clock estimation and synchronization using Kalman filtering
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Clock synchronization across a network is essential for a large number of applications ranging from wired network measurements to data fusion in sensor networks. Earlier techniques are either limited to undesirable accuracy or rely on specific hardware characteristics that may not be available for certain systems. In this work, we examine the clock synchronization problem in resource-constrained networks such as wireless sensor networks where nodes have limited energy and bandwidth, and also lack the high accuracy oscillators or programmable network interfaces some previous protocols depend on. This paper derives a general model for clock offset and skew and demonstrates its applicability. We design efficient algorithms based on this model to achieve high synchronization accuracy given limited resources. These algorithms apply the Kalman filter to track the clock offset and skew, and adaptively adjust the synchronization interval so that the desired error bounds are achieved. We demonstrate the performance advantages of our schemes through extensive simulations obeying real-world constraints.

WiMAX relay networks: opportunistic scheduling to exploit multiuser diversity and frequency selectivity
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
We study the problem of scheduling in OFDMA-based relay networks with emphasis on IEEE 802.16j based WiMAX relay networks. In such networks, in addition to a base station, multiple relay stations are used for enhancing the throughput, and/or improving the range of the base station. We solve the problem of MAC scheduling in such networks so as to serve the mobiles in a fair manner while exploiting the multiuser diversity, as well as the frequency selectivity of the wireless channel. The scheduling resources consist of tiles in a two-dimensional scheduling frame with time slots along one axis, and frequency bands or sub-channels along the other axis. The resource allocation problem has to be solved once every scheduling frame which is about 5 - 10 ms long. While the original scheduling problem is computationally complex, we provide an easy-to-compute upper bound on the optimum. We also propose three fast heuristic algorithms that perform close to the optimum (within 99.5%), and outperform other algorithms such as OFDM2A proposed in the past. Through extensive simulation results, we demonstrate the benefits of relaying in throughput enhancement (an improvement in the median throughput of about 25%), and feasibility of range extension (for e.g., 7 relays can be used to extend the cell-radius by 60% but mean throughput reduces by 36%). Our algorithms are easy to implement, and have an average running time of less than 0.05 ms making them appropriate for WiMAX relay networks.

On the critical phase transition time of wireless multi-hop networks with random failures
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
In this paper, we study the critical phase transition time of large-scale wireless multi-hop networks when the network topology experiences a partition due to increasing random node failures. We first define two new metrics, namely the last connection time and first partition time. The former is the last time that the network keeps a majority of surviving nodes connected in a single giant component; while the latter is the first time that the remaining surviving nodes are partitioned into multiple small components. Then we analyze the devolution process in a geometric random graph of n nodes based on percolation-theory connectivity and obtain the sufficient condition under which the graph is percolated. Based on the percolation condition, the last connection time and first partition time are found to be on the same order. Particularly, when the survival function of node lifetime is exponential, they are on the order of log(log n); while if the survival function is Pareto, the order is (log n)1/&#961;, where &#961; is the shape parameter of Pareto distribution. Finally, simulation results confirm that the last connection time and first partition time serve as the lower and upper bounds of the critical phase transition time, respectively. Further, an interesting result is that the network with heavy-tailed survival functions is no more resilient to random failures than the network with light-tailed ones, in terms of critical phase transition time, if the expected node lifetimes are identical.

Assessment of urban-scale wireless networks with a small number of measurements
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
In order to evaluate, improve, or expand a deployed, city-wide wireless mesh network, it is necessary to assess the network's spatial performance. In this paper, we present a general framework to accurately predict a network's well-served area, termed the metric region, via a small number of measurements. Assessment of deployed networks must address two key issues: non-uniform physical-layer propagation and high spatial variance in performance. Addressing non-uniformity, our framework estimates a mesh node's metric region via a data-driven sectorization of the region. We find each sector's boundary (radius) with a two-stage process of estimation and then measurement-driven "push-pull" refinement of the estimated boundary. To address high spatial variation, our coverage estimation couples signal strength measurements with terrain information from publicly available digital maps to estimate propagation characteristics between a wireless node and the client's location. To limit measurements and yield connected metric regions, we consider performance metrics (such as signal strength) to be monotonic with distance from the wireless node within each sector. We show that despite measured violations in coverage monotonicity, we obtain high accuracy with this assumption. We validate our estimation and refinement framework with measurements from 30,000 client locations obtained in each of two currently operational mesh networks, GoogleWiFi and TFA. We study three illustrative metrics: coverage, modulation rate, and redundancy, and find that to achieve a given accuracy, our framework requires two to five times fewer measurements than grid sampling strategies. Finally, we use the framework to evaluate the two deployments and study the average size and location of their coverage holes as well as the impact of client association policies on load-balancing.

Cabernet: vehicular content delivery using WiFi
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Cabernet is a system for delivering data to and from moving vehicles using open 802.11 (WiFi) access points encountered opportunistically during travel. Using open WiFi access from the road can be challenging. Network connectivity in Cabernet is both fleeting (access points are typically within range for a few seconds) and intermittent (because the access points do not provide continuous coverage), and suffers from high packet loss rates over the wireless channel. On the positive side, WiFi data transfers, when available, can occur at broadband speeds. In this paper, we introduce two new components for improving openWiFi data delivery to moving vehicles: The first, QuickWiFi, is a streamlined client-side process to establish end-to-end connectivity, reducing mean connection time to less than 400 ms, from over 10 seconds when using standard wireless networking software. The second part, CTP, is a transport protocol that distinguishes congestion on the wired portion of the path from losses over the wireless link, resulting in a 2x throughput improvement over TCP. To characterize the amount of open WiFi capacity available to vehicular users, we deployed Cabernet on a fleet of 10 taxis in the Boston area. The long-term average transfer rate achieved was approximately 38 Mbytes/hour per car (86 kbit/s), making Cabernet a viable system for a number of non-interactive applications.

Experiences in a 3G network: interplay between the wireless channel and applications
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
We present an experimental characterization of the physical and MAC layers in CDMA 1xEV-DO and their impact on transport layer performance. The 1xEV-DO network is currently the fastest mobile broadband cellular network, offering data rates of up to 3.1 Mbps for both stationary and mobile users. These rates are achieved by using novel capacity enhancement techniques at the lower layers. Specifically, 1xEV-DO incorporates rapid channel rate adaptation in response to signal conditions, and opportunistic scheduling to exploit channel fluctuations. Although shown to perform well in isolation, there is no comprehensive literature that examines the impact of these features on transport layer and application performance in real networks. We take the first step in addressing this issue through a large set of experiments conducted on a commercial 1xEV-DO network. Our evaluation includes both stationary and mobile scenarios wherein we transferred data using four popular transport protocols: TCPReno, TCP-Vegas, TCP-Westwood, and TCP-Cubic, and logged detailed measurements about wireless channel level characteristics as well as transport layer performance. We analyzed data from several days of experiments and inferred the properties of the physical, MAC and transport layers, as well as potential interactions between them. We find that the wireless channel data rate shows significant variability over long time scales on the order of hours, but retains high memory and predictability over small time scales on the order of milliseconds. We also find that loss-based TCP variants are largely unaffected by channel variations due to the presence of large buffers, and hence able to achieve in excess of 80% of the system capacity.

An empirical study of UHF RFID performance
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
This paper examines the performance of EPC Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFID reader systems in a realistic setting. Specifically, we identify factors that degrade overall performance and reliability with a focus on the physical layer, and we explore the degree to which reader configuration options can mitigate these factors. We use a custom software-radio based RFID monitoring system and configurable RFID readers to gather fine-grained data and assess the effects of the different factors. We find that physical layer considerations have a significant impact on reader performance, and that this is exacerbated by a lack of integration between the physical and MAC layers. We show that tuning physical layer operating parameters can increase the read rate for a set of tags by more than a third. Additionally, we show that tighter integration of the physical and MAC layers has the potential for even greater improvements.

Can CSMA/CA networks be made fair?
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
We demonstrate that CSMA/CA networks, including IEEE 802.11 networks, exhibit severe fairness problem in many scenarios, where some hosts obtain most of the channel's bandwidth while others starve. Most existing solutions require nodes to overhear transmissions made by contending nodes and, based on the overheard information, adjust local rates to achieve fairness among all contending links. Their underlying assumption is that transmissions made by contending nodes can be overheard. However, this assumption holds only when the transmission range is equal to the carrier sensing range, which is not true in reality. As our study reveals, the overhearing-based solutions, as well as several non-overhearing AIMD solutions, cannot achieve MAC-layer fairness in various settings. We propose a new rate control protocol, called PISD (Proportional Increase Synchronized multiplicative Decrease). Without relying on overhearing, it provides fairness in CSMA/CA networks, particularly IEEE 802.11 networks, by using only local information and performing localized operations. It combines several novel rate control mechanisms, including synchronized multiplicative decrease, proportional increase, and background transmission. We prove that PISD converges and achieves (weighted) fairness.

Horizon: balancing tcp over multiple paths in wireless mesh network
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
There has been extensive work on network architectures that support multi-path routing to improve performance in wireless mesh networks. However, previous work uses ad-hoc design principles that cannot guarantee any network-wide performance objectives such as conjointly maximizing resource utilization and improving fairness. In parallel, numerous theoretical results have addressed the issue of optimizing a combined metric of network utilization and fairness using techniques based on back-pressure scheduling, routing and flow control. However, the proposed theoretical algorithms are extremely difficult to implement in practice, especially in the presence of the 802.11 MAC and TCP. We propose Horizon, a novel system design for multi-path forwarding in wireless meshes, based on the theoretical results on back-pressure. Our design works with an unmodified TCP stack and on top of the existing 802.11 MAC. We modified the back-pressure approach to obtain a simple 802.11-compatible packet-forwarding heuristic and a novel, light-weight path estimator, while maintaining global optimality properties. We propose a delayed reordering algorithm that eliminates TCP timeouts while keeping TCP packet reordering to a minimum. We have evaluated our implementation on a 22-node testbed. We have shown that Horizon effectively utilizes available resources (disjoint paths). In contrast to previous work, our design not only avoids bottlenecks but also optimally load-balances traffic across them when needed, improving fairness among competing flows. To our knowledge, Horizon is the first practical wireless system based on back-pressure.

An adaptive, high performance mac for long-distance multihop wireless networks
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
We consider the problem of efficientMAC design for long-distance WiFi-based mesh networks. In such networks it is common to find long propagation delays, the use of directional antennas, and the presence of inter-link interference. Prior work has shown that these characteristics make traditional CSMA-based MACs a poor choice for long-distance mesh networks and this finding has led to several recent research efforts exploring the use of TDMA-based approaches to media access. In this paper we first identify, and then address, several shortcomings of current TDMA-based proposals. First, because they use fixed-length transmission slots, current TDMA-based solutions do not adapt to dynamic variations in traffic load leading to inefficiencies in both throughput and delay. As we show in this paper, the throughput achieved by existing solutions falls far short of the optimal achievable network throughput. Finally, due to the scheduling constraints imposed by inter-link interference, current TDMA-based solutions only apply to bipartite network topologies. In this paper, we present JazzyMac, a simple, practical and efficient MAC protocol that addresses the above limitations. JazzyMac achieves efficiency by allowing variable-length link transmissions slots and then defining a distributed protocol by which nodes adapt the length of their transmission slots to changing traffic demands. JazzyMac is practical in that the adaptation at each node uses purely local information and that our protocol applies to arbitrary network topologies. Finally, the use of dynamic slot sizes allows JazzyMac to achieve better tradeoffs between throughput and delay. We evaluate JazzyMac using detailed simulation over a range of traffic patterns and realistic topologies. Our results show that JazzyMac improves throughput in all considered scenarios. This improvement is often substantial (e.g.,in 50% of our scenarios, throughput improves by over 40%) and is particularly pronounced for the common case of asymmetric traffic (e.g.,leading to almost 100% improvements). Furthermore, compared to current solutions, JazzyMac can achieve much better average delay for the same throughput.

Challenges: automated design of networking protocols
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
This paper establishes a framework for the automated generation of networking protocols. The need for the rapid design of networking protocols in application-specific contexts has increased dramatically over the past five years. Each new application requires high performance in its own domain, as well as a rapid design cycle. Further, changes in physical layer technology quickly render previously high-performance protocols poor performance. Currently, there are no tools to automate the design of networking protocols. This paper addresses the challenge of building such tools. It proposes a methodology and a design chain for the automated generation of networking protocols, with the following novel ideas: (1) Formulation of the network protocol problem such that the exchange of protocol control information can be specified as part of the optimization program, (2) Optimal waveform generation, which specifies the optimal exchange of both control information and data, (3) Protocol Extraction: The extraction of the optimal protocol as a minimal description of the optimal waveforms. This methodology has the potential to dramatically change the future of networking protocol design by moving protocol design to a more abstract level, finding high-performance protocols not easily discovered by human intuition, and reducing the currently long protocol design cycles.

Ditto: a system for opportunistic caching in multi-hop wireless networks
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Ditto, a system that opportunistically caches overheard data to improve subsequent transfer throughput in wireless mesh networks. While mesh networks have been proposed as a way to provide cheap, easily deployable Internet access, they must maintain high transfer throughput to be able to compete with other last-mile technologies. Unfortunately, doing so is difficult because multi-hop wireless transmissions interfere with each other, reducing the available capacity on the network. This problem is particularly severe in common gateway-based scenarios in which nearly all transmissions go through one or a few gateways from the mesh network to the Internet. Ditto exploits on-path as well as opportunistic caching based on overhearing to improve the throughput of data transfers and to reduce load on the gateways. It uses content-based naming to provide application independent caching at the granularity of small chunks, a feature that is key to being able to cache partially overheard data transfers. Our evaluation of Ditto shows that it can achieve significant performance gains for cached data, increasing throughput by up to 7x over simpler on-path caching schemes, and by up to an order of magnitude over no caching.

Understanding congestion control in multi-hop wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Complex interference in static multi-hop wireless mesh networks can adversely affect transport protocol performance. Since TCP does not explicitly account for this, starvation and unfairness can result from the use of TCP over such networks. In this paper, we explore mechanisms for achieving fair and efficient congestion control for multi-hop wireless mesh networks. First, we design an AIMD-based rate-control protocol called Wireless Control Protocol (WCP) which recognizes that wireless congestion is a neighborhood phenomenon, not a node-local one, and appropriately reacts to such congestion. Second, we design a distributed rate controller that estimates the available capacity within each neighborhood, and divides this capacity to contending flows, a scheme we call Wireless Control Protocol with Capacity estimation (WCPCap). Using analysis, simulations, and real deployments, we find that our designs yield rates that are both fair and efficient, and achieve near optimal goodputs for all the topologies that we study. WCP achieves this level of performance while being extremely easy to implement. Moreover, WCPCap achieves the max-min rates for our topologies, while still being distributed and amenable to real implementation.

Incentive-compatible opportunistic routing for wireless networks
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
User-contributed wireless mesh networks are a disruptive technology that may fundamentally change the economics of edge network access and bring the benefits of a computer network infrastructure to local communities at low cost, anywhere in the world. To achieve high throughput despite highly unpredictable and lossy wireless channels, it is essential that such networks take advantage of transmission opportunities wherever they emerge. However, as opportunistic routing departs from the traditional but less effective deterministic, shortest-path based routing, user nodes in such networks may have less incentive to follow protocols and contribute. In this paper, we present the first routing protocols in which it is incentive-compatible for each user node to honestly participate in the routing despite opportunistic transmissions. We not only rigorously prove the properties of our protocols but also thoroughly evaluate a complete implementation of our protocols. Experiments show that there is a 5.8%-58.0% gain in throughput when compared with an opportunistic routing protocol that does not provide incentives and users can act selfishly.

Modulation rate adaptation in urban and vehicular environments: cross-layer implementation and experimental evaluation
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Accurately selecting modulation rates for time-varying channel conditions is critical for avoiding performance degradations due to rate overselection when channel conditions degrade or underselection when channel conditions improve. In this paper, we design a custom cross-layer framework that enables (i) implementation of multiple and previously unimplemented rate adaptation mechanisms, (ii) experimental evaluation and comparison of rate adaptation protocols on controlled, repeatable channels as well as residential urban and downtown vehicular and non-mobile environments in which we accurately measure channel conditions with 100-&#956;s granularity, and (iii) comparison of performance on a per-packet basis with the ideal modulation rate obtained via exhaustive experimental search. Our evaluation reveals that SNR-triggered protocols are susceptible to overselection from the ideal rate when the coherence time is low (a scenario that we show occurs in practice even in a nonmobile topology), and that "in-situ" training can produce large gains to overcome this sensitivity. Another key finding is that a mechanism effective in differentiating between collision and fading losses for hidden terminals has severely imbalanced throughput sharing when competing links are even slightly heterogeneous. In general, we find trained SNR-based protocols outperform loss-based protocols in terms of the ability to track vehicular clients, accuracy within outdoor environments, and balanced sharing with heterogeneous links (even with physical layer capture).

On link-layer reliability and stability for wireless communication
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
A primary focus of popular wireless link-layer protocols is to achieve some level of reliability using ARQ or Hybrid ARQ mechanisms. However, these and other leading link-layer protocols largely ignore the stability aspect of wireless communication, and rely on higher layers to provide stable traffic flow control. This design strategy has led to a great deal of inefficiency in throughput and to other major issues (such as the well-known TCP over-wireless performance degradation phenomenon and the numerous studies in attempt to fix it). In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift where both reliability and stability are targeted using an Automatic Code Embedding (ACE) wireless link-layer protocol. To the best of our knowledge this is the first effort to develop a theoretical framework for analyzing and designing a wireless link-layer protocol that targets system stability in conjunction with reliable communication. We present two distinct analytical frameworks to determine optimal code embedding rates which ensure system reliability and stability for wide range of traffic demand. An important conclusion of our analysis is that various traffic demand can be met using a packet-by-packet code embedding rate constraint that is independent of traffic type. We demonstrate experimentally that ACE provides both rapid and reliable point-to-point wireless data transmission for realtime and non-realtime traffic over real channel traces collected on 802.11b WLAN. We also have conducted extensive TCP simulations in conjunction with ACE; and we demonstrate the high level of efficiency and stability that can be achieved for TCP over ACE, while not making any changes to TCP. Further, the implementation of ACE for real-time video communication shows performance gains of 5-10dB over IEEE ARQ schemes. More importantly, ACE is layer oblivious and requires no changes to higher or lower PHY layers.

Taking the sting out of carrier sense: interference cancellation for wireless LANs
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
A fundamental problem with unmanaged wireless networks is high packet loss rates and poor spatial reuse, especially with bursty traffic typical of normal use. To address these limitations, we explore the notion of interference cancellation for unmanaged networks - the ability for a single receiver to disambiguate and successfully receive simultaneous overlapping transmissions from multiple unsynchronized sources. We describe a practical algorithm for interference cancellation, and implement it for ZigBee using software radios. In this setting, we find that our techniques can reduce packet loss rate and substantially increase spatial reuse. With carrier sense set to prevent concurrent sends, our approach reduces the packet loss rate during collisions from 14% to 8% due to improved handling of hidden terminals. Conversely, disabling carrier sense reduces performance for only 7% of all pairs of links and increases the delivery rate for the median pair of links in our testbed by a factor of 1.8 due to improved spatial reuse.

ZipTx: Harnessing Partial Packets in 802.11 Networks
Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2008
Current wireless protocols retransmit any packet that fails the checksum test, even when most of the bits are correctly received. Prior work has recognized this inefficiency, however the proposed solutions (e.g., PPR, HARQ and SOFT) require changes to the hardware and physical layer, and hence are not usable in today's WLANs and mesh networks. They are further tested in channels with fixed modulation and coding, whereas production 802.11 networks adapt their modulation and codes to maximize their ability to correct erroneous bits. This paper makes two key contributions: 1) it introduces ZipTx, a software-only solution that harvests the gains from using correct bits in corrupted packets using existing hardware, and 2) it characterizes the true gains of partially correct packets for the entire range of operation of 802.11 networks, and in the presence of adaptive modulation and error correcting codes. We implement ZipTx as a driver extension and evaluate our implementation in both outdoor and indoor environments, showing that ZipTx significantly improves the throughput.

Mining spectrum usage data: a large-scale spectrum measurement study
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Dynamic spectrum access has been a subject of extensive research activity in recent years. The increasing volume of literature calls for a deeper understanding of the characteristics of current spectrum utilization. In this paper we present a detailed spectrum measurement study, with data collected in the 20MHz to 3GHz spectrum band and at four locations concurrently in South China. We examine the first and second order statistics of the collected data, including channel occupancy/vacancy statistics, channel utilization within each individual wireless service, and the temporal, spectral, and spatial correlation of these measures. Main findings include that the channel vacancy durations follow an exponential-like distribution, but are not independently distributed over time, and that significant spectral and spatial correlations are found between channels of the same service. We then exploit such spectrum correlation to develop a 2-dimensional frequent pattern mining algorithm that can accurately predict channel availability based on past observations.

A quorum-based framework for establishing control channels in dynamic spectrum access networks
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Establishing a control channel for medium access control is a challenging problem in multi-channel and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks. In the design of multi-channel MAC protocols, the use of channel (or frequency) hopping techniques (a.k.a. parallel rendezvous) have been proposed to avoid the bottleneck of a single control channel. In DSA networks, the dynamic and opportunistic use of the available spectrum requires that the radios are able to "rendezvous" -- i.e., find each other to establish a link. The use of a dedicated global control channel simplifies the rendezvous process but may not be feasible in many opportunistic spectrum sharing scenarios due to the dynamically changing availability of all the channels, including the control channel. To address this problem, researchers have proposed the use of channel hopping protocols for enabling rendezvous in DSA networks. This paper presents a systematic approach, based on quorum systems, for designing and analyzing channel hopping protocols for the purpose of control channel establishment. The proposed approach, called Quorum-based Channel Hopping (QCH) system, can be used for implementing rendezvous protocols in DSA networks that are robust against link breakage caused by the appearance of incumbent user signals. We describe two optimal QCH systems under the assumption of global clock synchronization: the first system is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the time-to-rendezvous between any two channel hopping sequences; the second system is optimal in the sense that it guarantees the even distribution of the rendezvous points in terms of both time and channel, thus solving the \emph{rendezvous convergence} problem. We also propose an asynchronous QCH system that does not require global clock synchronization. Our analytical and simulation results show that the channel hopping schemes designed using our framework outperform existing schemes under various network conditions.

Throughput-efficient sequential channel sensing and probing in cognitive radio networks under sensing errors
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
In this paper, we exploit channel diversity for opportunistic spectrum access (OSA). Our approach uses channel quality as a second criterion (along with the idle/busy status of the channel) in selecting channels to use for opportunistic transmission. The difficulty of the problem comes from the fact that it is practically infeasible for a CR to first scan all channels and then pick the best among them, due to the potentially large number of channels open to OSA and the limited power/hardware capability of a CR. As a result, the CR can only sense and probe channels sequentially. To avoid collisions with other CRs, after sensing and probing a channel, the CR needs to make a decision on whether to terminate the scan and use the underlying channel or to skip it and scan the next one. The optimal use-or-skip decision strategy that maximizes the CR's average throughput is one of our primary concerns in this study. This problem is further complicated by practical considerations, such as sensing/probing overhead and sensing errors. An optimal decision strategy that addresses all the above considerations is derived by formulating the sequential sensing/probing process as a rate-of-return problem, which we solve using optimal stopping theory. We further explore the special structure of this strategy to conduct a "second-round" optimization over the operational parameters, such as the sensing and probing times. We show through simulations that significant throughput gains (e.g., about 100%) are achieved using our joint sensing/probing scheme over the conventional one that uses sensing alone.

SAM: enabling practical spatial multiple access in wireless LAN
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Spatial multiple access holds the promise to boost the capacity of wireless networks when an access point has multiple antennas. Due to the asynchronous and uncontrolled nature of wireless LANs, conventional MIMO technology does not work efficiently when concurrent transmissions from multiple stations are uncoordinated. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a crosslayer system, called SAM, that addresses the challenges of enabling spatial multiple access for multiple devices in a random access network like WLAN. SAM uses a chain-decoding technique to reliably recover the channel parameters for each device, and iteratively decode concurrent frames with misaligned symbol timings and frequency offsets. We propose a new MAC protocol, called CCMA, to enable concurrent transmissions by different mobile stations while remaining backward compatible with 802.11. Finally, we implement the PHY and MAC layer of SAM using the Sora high-performance software radio platform. Our evaluation results under real wireless conditions show that SAM can improve network uplink throughput by 70% with two antennas over 802.11.

Order matters: transmission reordering in wireless networks
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Modern wireless interfaces support a physical layer capability called Message in Message (MIM). Briefly, MIM allows a receiver to disengage from an ongoing reception, and engage onto a stronger incoming signal. Links that otherwise conflict with each other, can be made concurrent with MIM. However, the concurrency is not immediate, and can be achieved only if conflicting links begin transmission in a specific order. The importance of link order is new in wireless research, motivating MIM-aware revisions to link scheduling protocols. This paper identifies the opportunity in MIM-aware reordering, characterizes the optimal improvement in throughput, and designs a link layer protocol to achieve it. Testbed results confirm the performance gains of the proposed system.

Design, implementation and evaluation of an efficient opportunistic retransmission protocol
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
This paper presents an efficient opportunistic retransmission protocol (PRO, Protocol for Retransmitting Opportunistically) to improve the performance of IEEE 802.11 WLANs. PRO is a link-layer protocol that allows overhearing nodes to function as relays that retransmit on behalf of the source after they learn about a failed transmission. Relays with stronger connectivity to the destination have a higher chance of delivering the packet than the source does, thereby resulting in a more efficient use of the channel. PRO has four main features. First, channel reciprocity coupled with a run-time calibration process is used to estimate the instantaneous link quality to the destination. Second, a local qualification process filters out poor relays early. Third, a distributed relay selection algorithm chooses the best set of eligible relays among all qualified relays and prioritizes them. Finally, 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) is leveraged to make sure high priority relays transmit with high probability. PRO is designed to coexist with legacy 802.11 stations. We have implemented PRO in the driver of a commodity wireless card. Our extensive evaluation on both a controlled testbed and in the real world shows that PRO boosts throughput in diverse wireless environments, and especially in when there is significant contention for the channels, under fading, and with user mobility.

Esense: communication through energy sensing
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
In this paper, we present Esense: a new paradigm of communication between devices that have fundamentally different physical layers. The same communication framework also works between devices that have the same physical layer, which are out of communication range but within carrier-sense range. Esense is based on sensing and interpreting energy profiles. While our ideas are generic enough to be applicable in a variety of contexts, we illustrate the usefulness of our ideas by presenting novel solutions to existing problems in three distinct research domains. As part of these solutions, we demonstrate the ability to communicate between devices that follow two different standards: IEEE 802.11 and 802.15.4. We build an ``alphabet set'': a set of signature packet sizes which can be used for Esense. For this, we take a measurement based approach by considering WiFi traces from actual deployments. We then analyze the channel activity resulting from these traces and build an appropriate alphabet set for Esense communication. Our results show that we could potentially construct an alphabet of size as high as 100; such a large alphabet size promises efficient Esense communication. We also validate this alphabet set via a prototype implementation, and show that effective communication is indeed feasible even when both sides use different physical layers.

Capacity of large-scale CSMA wireless networks
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
In the literature, asymptotic studies of multi-hop wireless network capacity often consider only centralized and deterministic TDMA (time-division multi-access) coordination schemes. There have been fewer studies of the asymptotic capacity of large-scale wireless networks based on CSMA (carrier-sensing multi-access), which schedules transmissions in a distributed and random manner. With the rapid and widespread adoption of CSMA technology, a critical question is that whether CSMA networks can be as scalable as TDMA networks. To answer this question and explore the capacity of CSMA networks, we first formulate the models of CSMA protocols to take into account the unique CSMA characteristics, not captured by existing interference models in the literature. These CSMA models determine the feasible states, and consequently the capacity of CSMA networks. %and are functions of various CSMA parameters. We then study the throughput efficiency of CSMA scheduling as compared to TDMA. Finally, we tune the CSMA parameters so as to maximize the throughput to the optimal order. As a result, we show that CSMA can achieve throughput as &#937;(1/&#8730;n), the same order as optimal centralized TDMA, on uniform random networks. Our CSMA scheme makes use of an efficient backbone-peripheral routing scheme and a careful design of dual carrier-sensing and dual channel scheme. We also address practical implementation issues of our capacity-optimal CSMA scheme.

Scheduling partition for order optimal capacity in large-scale wireless networks
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
The capacity scaling property specifies the changes in network throughput when network size increases and serves as an essential performance evaluation metric for large-scale wireless networks. Existing results have been obtained based on the implicit assumption of negligible overhead in acquiring the network topology and synchronizing the link transmissions. In large networks, however, global topology collection and global link synchronization are infeasible with both the centralized and the distributed link scheduling schemes. This gap between the well-known capacity results and the impractical assumption on link scheduling potentially undermines our understanding of the achievable network capacity. Therefore, the following question remains open: can localized scheduling algorithms achieve the same order of capacity as their global counterpart? In this paper, we propose the scheduling partition methodology by decomposing a large network into many small autonomous scheduling zones, in which localized scheduling algorithms are implemented independently from one another. We prove that any localized scheduling algorithm that satisfies a set of sufficient and necessary conditions can yield the same order of capacity as the widely assumed global scheduling strategy. In comparison to the network dimension &#8730;n, scheduling partition sizes &#920;(&#8730;log n) and &#920;(1) are sufficient for optimal capacity scaling in the random and the arbitrary node placement models respectively. We finally propose an example localized link scheduling algorithm to verify the capacity achieved by scheduling partition. Our results thus provide guidelines on the scheduling algorithm design toward maximum capacity scaling in large-scale wireless networks.

Mobility increases the connectivity of K-hop clustered wireless networks
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
In this paper we investigate the connectivity for large-scale clustered wireless sensor and ad hoc networks. We study the effect of mobility on the critical transmission range for asymptotic connectivity in k-hop clustered networks, and compare to existing results on non-clustered stationary networks. By introducing k-hop clustering, any packet from a cluster member can reach a cluster head within k hops, and thus the transmission delay is bounded as &#920;(1) for any finite k. We first characterize the critical transmission range for connectivity in mobile k-hop clustered networks where all nodes move under either the random walk mobility model with non-trivial velocity or the i.i.d. mobility model. By the term non-trivial velocity, we mean that the velocity of nodes v is &#920;(1). We then compare with the critical transmission range for stationary k-hop clustered networks. We also study the transmission power versus delay trade-off and the average energy consumption per flow among different types of networks. We show that random walk mobility with non-trivial velocity increases connectivity in k-hop clustered networks, and thus significantly decreases the energy consumption and improves the power-delay trade-off. The decrease of energy consumption per flow is shown to be &#920;(logn/nd}) in clustered networks. These results provide insights on network design and fundamental guidelines on building a large-scale wireless network.

Opportunistic flooding in low-duty-cycle wireless sensor networks with unreliable links
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Intended for network-wide dissemination of commands, configurations and code binaries, flooding has been investigated extensively in wireless networks. However, little work has yet been done on low-duty-cycle wireless sensor networks in which nodes stay asleep most of time and wake up asynchronously. In this type of network, a broadcasting packet is rarely received by multiple nodes simultaneously, a unique constraining feature that makes existing solutions unsuitable. Combined with unreliable links, flooding in low-duty-cycle networks is a new challenging issue. In this paper, we introduce Opportunistic Flooding, a novel design tailored for low-duty-cycle networks with unreliable wireless links and predetermined working schedules. The key idea is to make probabilistic forwarding decisions at a sender based on the delay distribution of next-hop nodes. Only opportunistically early packets are forwarded using links outside the energy optimal tree to reduce the flooding delay and redundancy in transmission. To improve performance further, we propose a forwarder selection method to alleviate the hidden terminal problem and a link-quality-based backoff method to resolve simultaneous forwarding operations. We evaluate Opportunistic Flooding with extensive simulation and a test-bed implementation consisting of 30 MicaZ nodes. Evaluation shows our design is close to the optimal performance achievable by oracle flooding designs. Compared with improved traditional flooding, our design achieves significantly shorter flooding delay while consuming only 20% ~ 60% of the transmission energy in various low-duty-cycle network settings.

Compressive data gathering for large-scale wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2009
This paper presents the first complete design to apply compressive sampling theory to sensor data gathering for large-scale wireless sensor networks. The successful scheme developed in this research is expected to offer fresh frame of mind for research in both compressive sampling applications and large-scale wireless sensor networks. We consider the scenario in which a large number of sensor nodes are densely deployed and sensor readings are spatially correlated. The proposed compressive data gathering is able to reduce global scale communication cost without introducing intensive computation or complicated transmission control. The load balancing characteristic is capable of extending the lifetime of the entire sensor network as well as individual sensors. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can cope with abnormal sensor readings gracefully. We also carry out the analysis of the network capacity of the proposed compressive data gathering and validate the analysis through ns-2 simulations. More importantly, this novel compressive data gathering has been tested on real sensor data and the results show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme.

Data fusion improves the coverage of wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been increasingly available for critical applications such as security surveillance and environmental monitoring. An important performance measure of such applications is sensing coverage that characterizes how well a sensing field is monitored by a network. Although advanced collaborative signal processing algorithms have been adopted by many existing WSNs, most previous analytical studies on sensing coverage are conducted based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of sensing. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploring the fundamental limits of coverage based on stochastic data fusion models that fuse noisy measurements of multiple sensors. We derive the scaling laws between coverage, network density, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We show that data fusion can significantly improve sensing coverage by exploiting the collaboration among sensors. In particular, for signal path loss exponent of k (typically between 2.0 and 5.0), rho_f=O(rho_d^(1-1/k)), where rho_f and rho_d are the densities of uniformly deployed sensors that achieve full coverage under the fusion and disc models, respectively. Our results help understand the limitations of the previous analytical results based on the disc model and provide key insights into the design of WSNs that adopt data fusion algorithms. Our analyses are verified through extensive simulations based on both synthetic data sets and data traces collected in a real deployment for vehicle detection.

Lifetime and coverage guarantees through distributed coordinate-free sensor activation
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Wireless Sensor Networks are emerging as a key sensing technology, with diverse military and civilian applications. In these networks, a large number of sensors perform distributed sensing of a target field. Each sensor is a small battery-operated device that can sense events of interest in its sensing range and can communicate with neighboring sensors. A sensor cover is a subset of the set of all sensors such that every point in the target field is in the interior of the sensing ranges of at least $k$ different sensors in the subset, where k is a given positive integer. The lifetime of the network is the time from the point the network starts operation until the set of all sensors with non-zero remaining energy does not constitute a sensor cover. An important goal in sensor networks is to design a schedule, that is, a sequence of sensor covers to activate in every time slot, so as to maximize the lifetime of the network. In this paper, we design a polynomial-time, distributed algorithm for maximizing the lifetime of the network and prove that its lifetime is at most a factor O(log n * log nB) lower than the maximum possible lifetime, where n is the number of sensors and B is an upper bound on the initial energy of each sensor. Our algorithm does not require knowledge of the locations of nodes or directional information, which is difficult to obtain in sensor networks. Each sensor only needs to know the distances between adjacent nodes in its transmission range and their sensing radii. In every slot, the algorithm first assigns a weight to each node that is exponential in the fraction of its initial energy that has been used up so far. Then, in a distributed manner, it finds a O(log n) approximate minimum weight sensor cover which it activates in the slot. Our simulations reveal that our algorithm substantially outperforms several existing lifetime maximization algorithms.

Neighbor discovery in wireless networks and the coupon collector's problem
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Neighbor discovery is one of the first steps in the initialization of a wireless ad hoc network. In this paper, we design and analyze practical algorithms for neighbor discovery in wireless networks. We first consider an ALOHA-like neighbor discovery algorithm in a synchronous system, proposed in an earlier work. When nodes do not have a collision detection mechanism, we show that this algorithm reduces to the classical {\em Coupon Collector's Problem}. Consequently, we show that each node discovers all its $n$ neighbors in an expected time equal to $ne (\ln n + c)$, for some constant $c$. When nodes have a collision detection mechanism, we propose an algorithm based on receiver status feedback which yields a $\ln n$ improvement over the ALOHA-like algorithm. Our algorithms do not require nodes to have any estimate of the number of neighbors. In particular, we show that not knowing $n$ results in no more than a factor of two slowdown in the algorithm performance. In the absence of node synchronization, we develop asynchronous neighbor discovery algorithms that are only a factor of two slower than their synchronous counterparts. We show that our algorithms can achieve neighbor discovery despite allowing nodes to begin execution at different time instants. Furthermore, our algorithms allow each node to detect when to terminate the neighbor discovery phase.

Frequency-aware rate adaptation and MAC protocols
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
There has been burgeoning interest in wireless technologies that can use wider frequency spectrum. Technology advances, such as 802.11n and ultra-wideband (UWB), are pushing toward wider frequency bands. The analog-to-digital TV transition has made 100-250 MHz of digital whitespace bandwidth available for unlicensed access. Also, recent work on WiFi networks has advocated discarding the notion of channelization and allowing all nodes to access the wide 802.11 spectrum in order to improve load balancing. This shift towards wider bands presents an opportunity to exploit frequency diversity. Specifically, frequencies that are far from each other in the spectrum have significantly different SNRs, and good frequencies differ across sender-receiver pairs. This paper presents FARA, a combined frequency-aware rate adaptation and MAC protocol. FARA makes three departures from conventional wireless network design: First, it presents a scheme to robustly compute per-frequency SNRs using normal data transmissions. Second, instead of using one bit rate per link, it enables a sender to adapt the bitrate independently across frequencies based on these per-frequency SNRs. Third, in contrast to traditional frequency-oblivious MAC protocols, it introduces a MAC protocol that allocates to a sender-receiver pair the frequencies that work best for that pair. We have implemented FARA in FPGA on a wideband 802.11-compatible radio platform. Our experiments reveal that FARA provides a 3.1x throughput improvement in comparison to frequency-oblivious systems that occupy the same spectrum.

Optimal beam scheduling for multicasting in wireless networks
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
We consider the problem of efficient link-layer multicasting in wireless networks with switched beamforming antennas. The inherent tradeoff between multicasting and beamforming -- the broadcast advantage of low-gain omni-directional transmissions versus the high-gain but spatially restricted transmissions of beamforming antennas -- makes this problem especially challenging. In this paper, we design and evaluate optimal algorithms, and easy-to-implement greedy algorithms with performance guarantees, that generate and schedule efficient beam patterns for multicast transmissions. These algorithms are built upon the novel usage of composite beams that provide a knob to control the operating point of the tradeoff curve. This is in contrast to the sub-optimal usage of either purely directional or omni-directional beams by existing schemes. We further consider two models for composite beam pattern generation: one in which transmit power is (a) equally split, and (b) asymmetrically split between the constituent main lobes. A systematic evaluation, using real world traces obtained from measurements using an eight element switched beamforming antenna in an indoor office environment, indicates significant gains of about four folds over omni and two folds over prior art schemes.

It makes the case for using a two-tier hybrid wireless/wired architecture to interconnect hundreds to thousands of cores in chip multiprocessors (CMPs), where current interconnect technologies face severe scaling limitations in excessive latency, long wiring, and complex layout. We propose a recursive wireless interconnect structure called the WCube that features a single transmit antenna and multiple receive antennas at each micro wireless router and offers scalable performance in terms of latency and connectivity. We show the feasibility to build miniature on-chip antennas, and simple transmitters and receivers that operate at 100-500 GHz sub-terahertz frequency bands. We also devise new two-tier wormhole based routing algorithms that are deadlock free and ensure a minimum-latency route on a 1000-core on-chip interconnect network. Our simulations show that our protocol suite can reduce the observed latency by 20% to 45%, and consumes power that is comparable to or less than current 2-D wired mesh designs.

Glia: a practical solution for effective high datarate wifi-arrays
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Wi-fi standards have provisions for multiple orthogonal channels where the orthogonality allows them to be used simultaneously both in time and frequency without interference concerns. In this paper, we pose the following question: Can devices use the multiple orthogonal channels in wi-fi networks simultaneously to realize a high data-rate wireless link and hence cater to applications requiring high bandwidths? In other words, given that there are 3 orthogonal wi-fi channels in the 2.4GHz band and 12 orthogonal wi-fi channels in the 5GHz band, can a pair of devices each equipped with 15 wi-fi radios use all the available orthogonal channels to achieve a high data-rate link operating at 600Mbps? Surprisingly, we find through experimental evaluation that the actual observed performance when using all fifteen orthogonal channels between two devices is a mere 91Mbps. We identify the reasons behind the low performance and present Glia, a software only solution that effectively exercises all available radios. We prototype Glia and show using experimental evaluations that Glia helps achieve close to 600Mbps data-rate when using all possible wi-fi channels.

Link layer behavior of body area networks at 2.4 GHz
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Body Area Networks (BANs) can perform the task of continuous, remote monitoring of a patient's physiological signals in diverse environments. Apart from providing healthcare professionals with extensive logs of a patient's physiological history, BANs can be used to identify and react to emergency situations. We identify three important factors that afflict wireless communication in BANs: impermeability of the human body to radio waves at frequencies commonly used in BANs, efficient operation in mobile and time-varying environments, and mission-critical requirements for quick response to emergencies. An understanding of the link layer behavior of wireless sensor nodes placed on the body is crucial to address these and other challenges such as reducing energy consumption and increasing network lifetime. In this paper, we investigate link layer behavior by placing nodes on the body and directly measuring metrics of interest to engineers such as packet delivery ratio (PDR) and RSSI. Emulating a possible real-life BAN operating at the 2.4 GHz band with 12 sensor nodes, we collect over 80 hours of data from 14 volunteers in $3$ different environments that BANs are expected to operate in. We analyze the data to reveal several link layer characteristics to provide insight and guidelines for the designing of BANs. We also evaluate the performance of common routing metrics on our data. Our analysis helps us make the following conclusions. Link PDR is highly affected by the environment and not significantly by the volunteer for the experiment. Routing between nodes on the same side of the body is preferred to routing between nodes on the opposite sides. For links with the same source, failure of packet transmission to a certain node, in some cases, implies the increased probability of reception for other nodes. Most errors occur in bursts of length 1, but a small fraction occur in longer periods ($40$ packets or more).

Challenge: ultra-low-power energy-harvesting active networked tags (EnHANTs)
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
This paper presents the design challenges posed by a new class of ultra-low-power devices referred to as Energy-Harvesting Active Networked Tags (EnHANTs). EnHANTs are small, flexible, and self-reliant (in terms of energy devices that can be attached to objects that are traditionally not networked (e.g., books, clothing, and produce), thereby providing the infrastructure for various novel tracking applications. Examples of these applications include locating misplaced items, continuous monitoring of objects (items in a store, boxes in transit), and determining locations of disaster survivors. Recent advances in ultra-low-power wireless communications, ultra-wideband (UWB) circuit design, and organic electronic harvesting techniques will enable the realization of EnHANTs in the near future. In order for EnHANTs to rely on harvested energy, they have to spend significantly less energy than Bluetooth, Zigbee, and IEEE 802.15.4a devices. Moreover, the harvesting components and the ultra-low-power physical layer have special characteristics whose implications on the higher layers have yet to be studied (e.g., when using ultra-low-power circuits, the energy required to receive a bit is an order of magnitude higher than the energy required to transmit a bit). These special characteristics pose several new cross-layer research problems. In this paper, we describe the design challenges at the layers above the physical layer, point out relevant research directions, and outline possible starting points for solutions.

SurroundSense: mobile phone localization via ambience fingerprinting
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
A growing number of mobile computing applications are centered around the user's location. The notion of location is broad, ranging from physical coordinates (latitude/longitude) to logical labels (like Starbucks, McDonalds). While extensive research has been performed in physical localization, there have been few attempts in recognizing logical locations. This paper argues that the increasing number of sensors on mobile phones presents new opportunities for logical localization. We postulate that ambient sound, light, and color in a place convey a photo-acoustic signature that can be sensed by the phone's camera and microphone. In-built accelerometers in some phones may also be useful in inferring broad classes of user-motion, often dictated by the nature of the place. By combining these optical, acoustic, and motion attributes, it may be feasible to construct an identifiable fingerprint for logical localization. Hence, users in adjacent stores can be separated logically, even when their physical positions are extremely close. We propose SurroundSense, a mobile phone based system that explores logical localization via ambience fingerprinting. Evaluation results from 51 different stores show that SurroundSense can achieve an average accuracy of 87% when all sensing modalities are employed. We believe this is an encouraging result, opening new possibilities in indoor localization.

Fine-grained I/O access control of the mobile devices based on the Xen architecture
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
System virtualization is now available for mobile devices allowing for many advantages. Two of the major benefits from virtualization are system fault isolation and security. The isolated driver domain (IDD) model, a widely adopted architecture, enables strong system fault isolation by limiting the impact of driver faults to the driver domain itself. However, excessive I/O requests from a malicious domain to an IDD can cause CPU overuse of the IDD and performance degradation of applications in the IDD and other domains that share the same I/O device with the malicious do-main. If the IDD model is applied to mobile devices, this failure of performance isolation could also lead to battery drain, and thus it introduces a new severe threat to mobile devices. In order to solve this problem, we propose a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calcula-tion of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer ac-cording to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents malicious guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM. The evaluation shows our approach effectively protects a smart phone against excessive I/O attacks and guarantees availability.

A fundamental scalability criterion for data aggregation in VANETs
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
The distribution of dynamic information from many sources to many destinations is a key challenge for VANET applications such as cooperative traffic information management or decentralized parking guidance systems. In order for these systems to remain scalable it has been proposed to aggregate the information within the network as it travels from the sources to the destinations. However, so far it has remained unclear by what amount the aggregation scheme needs to reduce the original data in order to be considered scalable. In this paper we prove formally that any suitable aggregation scheme must reduce the bandwidth at which information about an area at distance d is provided to the cars asymptotically faster than 1/d2. Furthermore, we constructively show that this bound is tight: for any arbitrary &#949;&gt;0, there exists a scalable aggregation scheme that reduces information asymptotically like 1/d(2+&#949;).

CENTAUR: realizing the full potential of centralized wlans through a hybrid data path
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Enterprise WLANs have made a dramatic shift towards centralized architectures in the recent past. The reasons for such a change have been ease of management and better design of various control and security functions. The data path of WLANs, however, continues to use the distributed, random-access model, as defined by the popular DCF mechanism of the 802.11 standard. While theoretical results indicate that a centrally scheduled data path can achieve higher efficiency than its distributed counterpart, the likely complexity of such a solution has inhibited practical consideration. In this paper, we take a fresh, implementation and deployment oriented, view in understanding data path choices in enterprise WLANs. We perform extensive measurements to characterize the impact of various design choices, like scheduling granularity on the performance of a centralized scheduler, and identify regions where such a centralized scheduler can provide the best gains. Our detailed evaluation with scheduling prototypes deployed on two different wireless testbeds indicates that DCF is quite robust in many scenarios, but centralization can play a unique role in 1) mitigating hidden terminals - scenarios which may occur infrequently, but become pain points when they do and 2) exploiting exposed terminals - scenarios which occur more frequently, and limit the potential of successful concurrent transmissions. Motivated by these results, we design and implement CENTAUR - a hybrid data path for enterprise WLANs, that combines the simplicity and ease of DCF with a limited amount of centralized scheduling from a unique vantage point. Our mechanisms do not require client cooperation and can support legacy 802.11 clients.

OpenLIDS: a lightweight intrusion detection system for wireless mesh networks
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Wireless mesh networks are being used to provide Internet access in a cost efficient manner. Typically, consumer-level wireless access points with modified software are used to route traffic to potentially multiple back-haul points. Malware infected computers generate malicious traffic, which uses valuable network resources and puts other systems at risk. Intrusion detection systems can be used to detect such activity. Cost constraints and the decentralised nature of WMNs make performing intrusion detection on mesh devices desirable. However, these devices are typically resource constrained. This paper describes the results of examining their ability to perform intrusion detection. Our experimental study shows that commonly-used deep packet inspection approaches are unreliable on such hardware. We implement a set of lightweight anomaly detection mechanisms as part of an intrusion detection system, called OpenLIDS. We show that even with the limited hardware resources of a mesh device, it can detect current malware behaviour in an efficient way.

On the effectiveness of secret key extraction from wireless signal strength in real environments
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
We evaluate the effectiveness of secret key extraction, for private communication between two wireless devices, from the received signal strength (RSS) variations on the wireless channel between the two devices. We use real world measurements of RSS in a variety of environments and settings. Our experimental results show that (i) in certain environments, due to lack of variations in the wireless channel, the extracted bits have very low entropy making these bits unsuitable for a secret key, (ii) an adversary can cause predictable key generation in these static environments, and (iii) in dynamic scenarios where the two devices are mobile, and/or where there is a significant movement in the environment, high entropy bits are obtained fairly quickly. Building on the strengths of existing secret key extraction approaches, we develop an environment adaptive secret key generation scheme that uses an adaptive lossy quantizer in conjunction with Cascade-based information reconciliation [7] and privacy amplification [14]. Our measurements show that our scheme, in comparison to the existing ones that we evaluate, performs the best in terms of generating high entropy bits at a high bit rate. The secret key bit streams generated by our scheme also pass the randomness tests of the NIST test suite [21] that we conduct.

Localization with snap-inducing shaped residuals (SISR): coping with errors in measurement
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
We consider the problem of localizing wireless nodes in an outdoor, open-space environment, using ad-hoc radio ranging measurements, e.g., 802.11. We cast these ranging measurements as a set of distance constraints, thus forming an over-determined system of equations suitable for non-linear least squares optimization. However, ranging measurements are often subject to errors, induced by multipath signals and variations in path loss, unreliable hardware or antenna connectors, or imperfection in measurement models. Such potentially large, non-Gaussian errors in the measurement data ultimately produce inaccurate localization solutions. We propose a new error-tolerant localization method, called snap-inducing shaped residuals (SISR), to identify automatically "bad nodes" and "bad links" arising from these errors, so that they receive less weight in the localization process. In particular, SISR snaps "good nodes" to their accurate locations and gives less emphasis to other nodes. While the mathematical techniques used by SISR are similar to robust statistics, SISR's exploitation of the snap-in effect in localization appears to be novel. We provide analysis on the principle of SISR, illustrate errors in real-world measurements, and demonstrate a working SISR implementation in field experiments on a testbed of 37 wireless nodes, as well as show the superior performance of SISR in simulation with a larger number of nodes.

Hiding stars with fireworks: location privacy through camouflage
Proceedings of the 15th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2009
Individuals face privacy risks when providing personal location data to potentially untrusted location based services (LBSs). We develop and demonstrate CacheCloak, a system that enables realtime anonymization of location data. In CacheCloak, a trusted anonymizing server generates mobility predictions from historical data and submits intersecting predicted paths simultaneously to the LBS. Each new predicted path is made to intersect with other users' paths, ensuring that no individual user's path can be reliably tracked over time. Mobile users retrieve cached query responses for successive new locations from the trusted server, triggering new prediction only when no cached response is available for their current locations. A simulated hostile LBS with detailed mobility pattern data attempts to track users of CacheCloak, generating a quantitative measure of location privacy over time. GPS data from a GIS-based traffic simulation in an urban environment shows that CacheCloak can achieve realtime location privacy without loss of location accuracy or availability.

Side channel: bits over interference
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Interference is a critical issue in wireless communications. In a typical multiple-user environment, different users may severely interfere with each other. Coordination among users therefore is an indispensable part for interference management in wireless networks. It is known that, coordination among multiple nodes is a costly operation taking a significant amount of valuable communication resource. In this paper, we have an interesting observation that by generating intended patterns, some simultaneous transmissions, i.e., "interference", can be successfully decoded without degrading the effective throughput in original transmission. As such, an extra and "free" coordination channel can be built. Based on this idea we propose a DC-MAC to leverage this "free" channel for efficient medium access in a multiple-user wireless network. We theoretically analyze the capacity of this channel under different environments with various modulation schemes. USRP2-based implementation experiments show that compared with the widely adopted CSMA, DC-MAC can improve the channel utilization efficiency by up to 250%.

CSMA/CN: carrier sense multiple access with collision notification
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
A wireless transmitter learns of a packet loss, infers collision, only after completing the entire transmission. If the transmitter could detect the collision early (such as with CSMA/CD in wired networks), it could immediately abort its transmission, freeing the channel for useful communication. There are two main hurdles to realize CSMA/CD in wireless networks. First, a wireless transmitter cannot simultaneously transmit and listen for a collision. Second, any channel activity around the transmitter may not be an indicator of collision at the receiver. This paper attempts to approximate CSMA/CD in wireless networks with a scheme called CSMA/CN (collision notification). Under CSMA/CN, the receiver uses PHY layer information to detect a collision and immediately notifies the transmitter. The collision notification consists of a unique signature, sent on the same channel as the data. The transmitter employs a listener antenna and performs signature correlation to discern this notification. Once discerned, the transmitter immediately aborts transmission. We show that the notification signature can be reliably detected at the listener antenna, even in the presence of a strong self-interference from the transmit antenna. A prototype testbed of 10 USRP/GNURadios demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of CSMA/CN

The spaces between us: setting and maintaining boundaries in wireless spectrum access
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Guardbands are designed to insulate transmissions on adjacent frequencies from mutual interference. As more devices in a given area are packed into orthogonal wireless channels, choosing the right guardband size to minimize cross-channel interference becomes critical to network performance. Using both WiFi and GNU radio experiments, we show that the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach to guardband assignment is ineffective, and can produce throughput degradation up to 80%. We find that ideal guardband values vary across different network configurations, and across different links in the same network. We argue that guardband values should be set based on network conditions and adapt to changes over time. We propose Ganache, an intelligent guardband configuration system that dynamically sets and adapts guardbands based on local topology and propagation conditions. Ganache includes three key mechanisms: an empirical model of guardband sizes based on power heterogeneity of adjacent links, network-wide frequency and guardband assignment, and local guardband adaptation triggered by real-time detection of cross-band interference. We deploy a Ganache prototype on a local 8-node GNU radio testbed. Detailed experiments on different topologies show that to minimize interference, traditional fixed-size configurations allocate more than 40% of available spectrum to guardbands, while Ganache does the same using only 10% of the spectrum, leading to a 150% gain in throughput.

ZiFi: wireless LAN discovery via ZigBee interference signatures
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
WiFi networks have enjoyed an unprecedent penetration rate in recent years. However, due to the limited coverage, existing WiFi infrastructure only provides intermittent connectivity for mobile users. Once leaving the current network coverage, WiFi clients must actively discover new WiFi access points (APs), which wastes the precious energy of mobile devices. Although several solutions have been proposed to address this issue, they either require significant modifications to existing network infrastructures or rely on context information that is not available in unknown environments. In this work, we develop a system called ZiFi that utilizes ZigBee radios to identify the existence of WiFi networks through unique interference signatures generated by WiFi beacons. We develop a new digital signal processing algorithm called Common Multiple Folding (CMF) that accurately amplifies periodic beacons in WiFi interference signals. ZiFi also adopts a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector that can minimize the false negative (FN) rate of WiFi beacon detection while satisfying the user-specified upper bound on false positive (FP) rate. We have implemented ZiFi on two platforms, a Linux netbook integrating a TelosB mote through the USB interface, and a Nokia N73 smartphone integrating a ZigBee card through the miniSD interface. Our experiments show that, under typical settings, ZiFi can detect WiFi APs with high accuracy (<5% total FP and FN rate), short delay (~780 ms), and little computation overhead

CTRL: a self-organizing femtocell management architecture for co-channel deployment
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Femtocell technology has been drawing considerable attention as a cost-effective means of improving cellular coverage and capacity. However, under co-channel deployment, femtocells may incur high uplink interference to existing macrocells, and vice versa. To alleviate this interference, we propose a distributed and self-organizing femtocell management architecture, called CTRL Complementary TRi-control Loops), that consists of three control loops. First, for protection of macrocell users' uplink communications, CTRL controls the maximum TX power of femtocell users based on the fedback macrocell's load margin so as to keep, on average, the macrocell load below a certain threshold. Second, CTRL determines the target SINRs of femtocell users, conditioned on the maximum TX power, to reach a Nash equilibrium based on their utility functions, thus achieving efficient coordination of uplink usage among femtocells. Third, for protection of femtocell users' uplink communications, the instantaneous TX power of each femtocell user is controlled to achieve the target SINR against bursty interference from nearby macrocell or femtocell users. Our in-depth evaluation has shown CTRL to successfully preserve the macrocell users' service quality from femtocells' interference and converge to an optimal point under highly dynamic user TX conditions. CTRL is also shown to limit the effects of the estimation errors of channel gains and feedback delay.

Intentional networking: opportunistic exploitation of mobile network diversity
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Mobile devices face a diverse and dynamic set of networking options. Using those options to the fullest requires knowledge of application intent. This paper describes Intentional Networking, a simple but powerful mechanism for handling network diversity. Applications supply a declarative label for network transmissions, and the system matches transmissions to the most appropriate network. The system may also defer and re-order opportunistic transmissions subject to application-supplied mutual exclusion and ordering constraints. We have modified three applications to use Intentional Networking: BlueFS, a distributed file system for pervasive computing, Mozilla's Thunderbird e-mail client, and a vehicular participatory sensing application. We evaluated the performance of these applications using measurements obtained by driving a vehicle through WiFi and cellular 3G network coverage. Compared to an idealized solution that makes optimal use of all aggregated available networks but that lacks knowledge of application intent, Intentional Networking improves the latency of interactive messages from 48% to 13x, while adding no more than 7% throughput overhead.

Bartendr: a practical approach to energy-aware cellular data scheduling
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Cellular radios consume more power and suffer reduced data rate when the signal is weak. According to our measurements, the communication energy per bit can be as much as 6x higher when the signal is weak than when it is strong. To realize energy savings, applications must preferentially communicate when the signal is strong, either by deferring non-urgent communication or by advancing anticipated communication to coincide with periods of strong signal. Allowing applications to perform such scheduling requires predicting signal strength, so that opportunities for energy-efficient communication can be anticipated. Furthermore, such prediction must be performed at little energy cost. In this paper, we make several contributions towards a practical system for energy-aware cellular data scheduling called Bartendr. First, we establish, via measurements, the relationship between signal strength and power consumption. Second, we show that location alone is not sufficient to predict signal strength and motivate the use of tracks to enable effective prediction. Finally, we develop energy-aware scheduling algorithms for different workloads - syncing and streaming - and evaluate these via simulation driven by traces obtained during actual drives, demonstrating energy savings of up to 60%. Our experiments have been performed on four cellular networks across two large metropolitan areas, one in India and the other in the U.S.

Challenge: towards distributed RFID sensing with software-defined radio
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Current Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology involves two types of physical devices: tags and reader. The reader combines in a single physical device transmission (to the tags) and reception (from the tags) functions. In this paper we discuss an alternative approach, where receive functions are performed by a separate device called "RFID listener". This allows distributed tag-sensing schemes where one transmitter coexists with multiple listeners. We discuss pros and cons of both approaches and present our implementation of a passive RFID listener on GNU Radio. Our implementation is a basis for experimenting with future distributed listener-based systems, but it can be also used as a cheap and flexible protocol analyzer for currently available commercial RFID readers.

Challenge: mobile optical networks through visual MIMO
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Mobile optical communications has so far largely been limited to short ranges of about ten meters, since the highly directional nature of optical transmissions would require costly mechanical steering mechanisms. Advances in CCD and CMOS imaging technology along with the advent of visible and infrared (IR) light sources such as (light emitting diode) LED arrays presents an exciting and challenging concept which we call as visual-MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) where optical transmissions by multiple transmitter elements are received by an array of photodiode elements (e.g. pixels in a camera). Visual-MIMO opens a new vista of research challenges in PHY, MAC and Network layer research and this paper brings together the networking, communications and computer vision fields to discuss the feasibility of this as well as the underlying opportunities and challenges. Example applications range from household/factory robotic to tactical to vehicular networks as well pervasive computing, where RF communications can be interference-limited and prone to eavesdropping and security lapses while the less observable nature of highly directional optical transmissions can be beneficial. The impact of the characteristics of such technologies on the medium access and network layers has so far received little consideration. Example characteristics are a strong reliance on computer vision algorithms for tracking, a form of interference cancellation that allows successfully receiving packets from multiple transmitters simultaneously, and the absence of fast fading but a high susceptibility to outages due to line-of-sight interruptions. These characteristics lead to significant challenges and opportunities for mobile networking research

Hermes: data transmission over unknown voice channels
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
While the cellular revolution has made voice connectivity ubiquitous in the developing world, data services are largely absent or are prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we present Hermes1, a point-to-point data connectivity solution that works by modulating data onto acoustic signals that are sent over a cellular voice call. The main challenge is that most voice codecs greatly distort signals that are not voice-like; furthermore, the backhaul can be highly heterogeneous and of low quality, thereby introducing unpredictable distortions. Hermes modulates data over the extremely narrow-band approximately 3kHz bandwidth) acoustic carrier, while being severely constrained by the requirement that the resulting sound signals are voice-like, as far as the voice codecs are concerned. Hermes uses a robust data transcoding and modulation scheme to detect and correct errors in the face of bit flips, insertions and deletions; it also adapts the modulation parameters to the observed bit error rate on the actual voice channel. Through real-world experiments, we show that Hermes achieves approximately 1.2 kbps goodput which when compared to SMS, improves throughput by a factor of 5&#215; and reduces the cost-per-byte by over a factor of 50x

SMS-based web search for low-end mobile devices
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2010
Short Messaging Service (SMS) based mobile information services have become increasingly common around the world, especially in emerging regions among users with low-end mobile devices. This paper presents the design and implementation of SMSFind, an SMS-based search system that enables users to obtain extremely concise (one SMS) message of 140 bytes) and appropriate search responses for queries across arbitrary topics in one round of interaction. SMSFind is designed to complement existing SMS-based search services that are either limited in the topics they recognize or involve a human in the loop. Given an unstructured search query, SMSFind, uses a conventional search engine as a back-end to elicit several search responses and uses a combination of information retrieval techniques to extract the most appropriate 140-byte snippet as the final SMS search response. We show that SMSFind returns appropriate responses for 57.3% of ChaCha search queries in our test set; this accuracy rate is high given that ChaCha employs a human to answer the same questions. We have also deployed a pilot version of SMSFind for use with a small focus group in Kenya to explore the interaction issues of such a system and share our experience.

PixNet: interference-free wireless links using LCD-camera pairs
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Given the abundance of cameras and LCDs in today's environment, there exists an untapped opportunity for using these devices for communication. Specifically, cameras can tune to nearby LCDs and use them for network access. The key feature of these LCD-camera links is that they are highly directional and hence enable a form of interference-free wireless communication. This makes them an attractive technology for dense, high contention scenarios. The main challenge however, to enable such LCD-camera links is to maximize coverage, that is to deliver multiple Mb/s over multi-meter distances, independent of the view angle. To do so, these links need to address unique types of channel distortions, such as perspective distortion and blur. This paper explores this novel communication medium and presents PixNet, a system for transmitting information over LCD-camera links. PixNet generalizes the popular OFDM transmission algorithms to address the unique characteristics of the LCD-camera link which include perspective distortion, blur, and sensitivity to ambient light. We have built a prototype of PixNet using off-the-shelf LCDs and cameras. An extensive evaluation shows that a single PixNet link delivers data rates of up to 12 Mb/s at a distance of 10 meters, and works with view angles as wide as 120 degree&#176;.

Did you see Bob?: human localization using mobile phones
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Finding a person in a public place, such as in a library, conference hotel, or shopping mall, can be difficult. The difficulty arises from not knowing where the person may be at that time; even if known, navigating through an unfamiliar place may be frustrating. Maps and floor plans help in some occasions, but such maps may not be always handy. In a small scale poll, 80% of users responded that the ideal solution would be "to have an escort walk me to the desired person". This paper identifies the possibility of using mobile phone sensors and opportunistic user-intersections to develop an electronic escort service. By periodically learning the walking trails of different individuals, as well as how they encounter each other in space-time, a route can be computed between any pair of persons. The problem bears resemblance to routing packets in delay tolerant networks, however, its application in the context of human localization raises distinct research challenges. We design and implement Escort, a system that guides a user to the vicinity of a desired person in a public place. We only use an audio beacon, randomly placed in the building, to enable a reference frame. We do not rely on GPS, WiFi, or war-driving to locate a person - the Escort user only needs to follow an arrow displayed on the phone. Evaluation results from experiments in parking lots and university buildings show that, on average, the user is brought to within 8m of the destination. We believe this is an encouraging result, opening new possibilities in mobile, social localization.

Exploiting temporal stability and low-rank structure for localization in mobile networks
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Localization is a fundamental operation for many wireless networks. While GPS is widely used for location determination, it is unavailable in many environments either due to its high cost or the lack of line of sight to the satellites (e.g., indoors, under the ground, or in a downtown canyon). The limitations of GPS have motivated researchers to develop many localization schemes to infer locations based on measured wireless signals. However, most of these existing schemes focus on localization in static wireless networks. As many wireless networks are mobile (e.g., mobile sensor networks, disaster recovery networks, and vehicular networks), we focus on localization in mobile networks in this paper. We analyze real mobility traces and find that they exhibit temporal stability and low-rank structure. Motivated by this observation, we develop three novel localization schemes to accurately determine locations in mobile networks: (i) Low Rank based Localization (LRL), which exploits the low-rank structure in mobility, (ii) Temporal Stability based Localization (TSL), which leverages the temporal stability, and (iii) Temporal Stability and Low Rank based Localization (TSLRL), which incorporates both the temporal stability and the low-rank structure. These localization schemes are general and can leverage either mere connectivity (i.e., range-free localization) or distance estimation between neighbors (i.e., range-based localization). Using extensive simulations and testbed experiments, we show that our new schemes significantly outperform state-of-the-art localization schemes under a wide range of scenarios and are robust to measurement errors.

Indoor localization without the pain
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
While WiFi-based indoor localization is attractive, the need for a significant degree of pre-deployment effort is a key challenge. In this paper, we ask the question: can we perform indoor localization with no pre-deployment effort? Our setting is an indoor space, such as an office building or a mall, with WiFi coverage but where we do not assume knowledge of the physical layout, including the placement of the APs. Users carrying WiFi-enabled devices such as smartphones traverse this space in normal course. The mobile devices record Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements corresponding to APs in their view at various (unknown) locations and report these to a localization server. Occasionally, a mobile device will also obtain and report a location fix, say by obtaining a GPS lock at the entrance or near a window. The centerpiece of our work is the EZ Localization algorithm, which runs on the localization server. The key intuition is that all of the observations reported to the server, even the many from unknown locations, are constrained by the physics of wireless propagation. EZ models these constraints and then uses a genetic algorithm to solve them. The results from our deployment in two different buildings are promising. Despite the absence of any explicit pre-deployment calibration, EZ yields a median localization error of 2m and 7m, respectively, in a small building and a large building, which is only somewhat worse than the 0.7m and 4m yielded by the best-performing but calibration-intensive Horus scheme [29] from prior work.

Privacy vulnerability of published anonymous mobility traces
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Mobility traces of people and vehicles have been collected and published to assist the design and evaluation of mobilee networks, such as large-scale urban sensing networks. Although the published traces are often made anonymous in that the true identities of nodes are replaced by random identifiers, the privacy concern remains. This is because in real life, nodes are open to observations in public spaces, or they may voluntarily or inadvertently disclose partial knowledge of their whereabouts. Thus, snapshots of nodes' location information can be learned by interested third parties, e.g., directly through chance/engineered meetings between the nodes and their observers, or indirectly through casual conversations or other information sources about people. In this paper, we investigate how an adversary, when equipped with a small amount of the snapshot information termed as side information, can infer an extended view of the whereabouts of a victim node appearing in an anonymous trace. Our results quantify the loss of victim nodes' privacy as a function of the nodal mobility (captured in both real and synthetic traces), the inference strategies of adversaries, and any noise that may appear in the trace or the side information. Generally, our results indicate that the privacy concern is significant in that a relatively small amount of side information is sufficient for the adversary to infer the true identity (either uniquely or with high probability) of a victim in a set of anonymous traces.

Design and experimental evaluation of multi-user beamforming in wireless LANs
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Multi-User MIMO promises to increase the spectral efficiency of next generation wireless systems and is currently being incorporated in future industry standards. Although a significant amount of research has focused on theoretical capacity analysis, little is known about the performance of such systems in practice. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the first multi-user beamforming system and experimental framework for wireless LANs. Using extensive measurements in an indoor environment, we evaluate the impact of receiver separation distance, outdated channel information due to mobility and environmental variation, and the potential for increasing spatial reuse. For the measured indoor environment, our results reveal that two receivers achieve close to maximum performance with a minimum separation distance of a quarter of a wavelength. We also show that the required channel information update rate is dependent on environmental variation and user mobility as well as a per-link SNR requirement. Assuming that a link can tolerate an SNR decrease of 3 dB, the required channel update rate is equal to 100 and 10 ms for non-mobile receivers and mobile receivers with a pedestrian speed of 3 mph respectively. Our results also show that spatial reuse can be increased by efficiently eliminating interference at any desired location; however, this may come at the expense of a significant drop in the quality of the served users.

Pushing the envelope of indoor wireless spatial reuse using directional access points and clients
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Recent work demonstrates that directional antennas have significant potential to improve wireless network capacity in indoor environments. This paper provides a broader exploration of the design space of indoor directional antenna systems along two main dimensions: antenna configuration and antenna control. Studying a number of alternative configurations, we find that directionality on APs and clients can significantly improve performance, even over other configurations with stronger directionality. Moreover, it is sufficient to have a small number of narrow beam antennas to achieve such gains, thus making such a solution practical for actual deployment. Designing systems with directional APs and clients for increased spatial reuse comes, however, with a number of challenges in the way the directional antennas are controlled. Antenna control needs to encompass antenna orientation algorithms, an appropriate MAC layer protocol, and novel client-AP association solutions. To overcome these challenges, we propose Speed, a distributed directional antenna control system that is easy to deploy and significantly improves network capacity over existing solutions.

Directional antenna diversity for mobile devices: characterizations and solutions
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
We report a first-of-its-kind realization of directional transmission for smartphone-like mobile devices using multiple passive directional antennas, supported by only one RF chain. The key is a multi-antenna system (MiDAS) and its antenna selection methods that judiciously select the right antenna for transmission. It is grounded by two measurement-driven studies regarding 1) how smartphones rotate during wireless usage in the field and 2) how orientation and rotation impact the performance of directional antennas under various propagation environments. We implement MiDAS and its antenna selection methods using the WARP platform. We evaluate the implementation using a computerized motor to rotate the prototype according to traces collected from smartphone users in the field. Our evaluation shows that MiDAS achieves a median of 3dB increase in link gain. We demonstrate that rate adaptation and power control can be combined with MiDAS to further improve goodput and power saving. Real-time experiments with the prototype show that the link gain translates to 85% goodput improvement for a low SNR scenario. The same gain translates to 51% transmit power reduction for a high SNR scenario. Compared to other methods in realizing directional communication, MiDAS does not require any changes to the network infrastructure, and is therefore suitable for immediate or near-future deployment.

NVS: a virtualization substrate for WiMAX networks
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
This paper describes the design and implementation of a network virtualization substrate NVS) for effective virtualization of wireless resources in WiMAX networks. Virtualization fosters the realization of several interesting deployment scenarios such as customized virtual networks, virtual services and wide-area corporate networks, with diverse performance objectives. In virtualizing a basestation's uplink and downlink resources into slices, NVS meets three key requirements - isolation, customization, and efficient resource utilization - using two novel features: (1) NVS introduces a provably-optimal slice scheduler that allows existence of slices with bandwidth-based and resource-based reservations simultaneously, and (2) NVS includes a generic framework for efficiently enabling customized flow scheduling within the basestation on a per-slice basis. Through a prototype implementation and detailed evaluation on a WiMAX testbed, we demonstrate the efficacy of NVS. For instance, we show for both downlink and uplink directions that NVS can run different flow schedulers in different slices, run different slices simultaneously with different types of reservations, and perform slice-specific application optimizations for providing customized services.

Stix: a goal-oriented distributed management system for large-scale broadband wireless access networks
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Stix is a platform managing emerging large-scale broadband wireless access (BWA) networks. It has been developed to make it easy to manage such networks for community deployments and wireless Internet service providers while keeping the network management infrastructure scalable and flexible. Stix is based on the notions of goal-oriented and in-network management. With Stix, administrators graphically specify network management activities as workflows, which are deployed at a distributed set of agents within the network that cooperate in executing those workflows and storing management information. We implement the Stix system on embedded boards and show that the implementation has a low memory footprint. Using real topology and logging data from a large-scale BWA network operator, we show that Stix is significantly more scalable (via reduction in management traffic) compared to the commonly employed centralized management approach. Finally we use two case studies to demonstrate the ease with which Stix platform can be used for carrying out network reconfiguration and performance management tasks, thereby also showing its potential as a flexible platform to realize self-management mechanisms.

MIMO rate adaptation in 802.11n wireless networks
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
This paper studies MIMO based rate adaptation (RA) in 802.11n wireless networks. Our case study shows that existing RA algorithms offer much lower throughput than even a fixed-rate scheme. The fundamental problem is that, all such algorithms are MIMO oblivious; they do not consider the characteristics of diversity-oriented, single-stream mode and the spatial multiplexing driven, double-stream mode. We propose MiRA, a novel MIMO RA scheme that zigzags between intra- and inter-mode rate options. Our experiments show that MiRA consistently outperforms three representative RA algorithms, SampleRate, RRAA and Atheros MIMO RA, in static, mobility and collision settings.

Fair WLAN backhaul aggregation
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Aggregating multiple 802.11 Access Point (AP) backhauls using a single-radio WLAN card has been considered as a way of bypassing the backhaul capacity limit. However, current AP aggregation solutions greedily maximize the individual station throughput without taking fairness into account. This can lead to grossly unfair throughput distributions, which can discourage user participation and severely limit commercial deployability. Motivated by this problem, we present THEMIS, a single-radio station that performs multi-AP backhaul aggregation in a fair and distributed way, without requiring any change in the network. We implement THEMIS on commodity hardware, evaluate it extensively through controlled experimental tests, and validate it in a deployment spanning 3 floors of a multistory building. THEMIS is being used in a commercial trial by a major broadband provider to its customers.

Retransmission &#8800; repeat: simple retransmission permutation can resolve overlapping channel collisions
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Collisions in overlapping channels can be a major problem in the deployment of high-speed OFDM networks. In this paper, we present Remap, a simple, novel paradigm for handling collisions in overlapping OFDM channels. Remap introduces a novel concept of retransmission permutation that permutes the bit-to-subcarrier assignment after each transmission, departing from the traditional, simply-repeat paradigm. Remap is simple to implement and able to exploit collision-free subcarriers to decode frames despite successive collisions in overlapping channels. We apply Remap to 802.11g to demonstrate that the diversity created by remapped frames can substantially improve decoding efficiency and improve wireless throughput. We implement our technique in software radio and demonstrate that it has potential to be deployed with simple software and firmware updates.

Sybot: an adaptive and mobile spectrum survey system for wifi networks
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Information on site-specific spectrum characteristics is essential to evaluate and improve the performance of wireless networks. However, it is usually very costly to obtain accurate spectrum-condition information in heterogeneous wireless environments. This paper presents a novel spectrum-survey system, called Sybot (Spectrum survey robot), that guides network engineers to efficiently monitor the spectrum condition (e.g., RSS) of WiFi networks. Sybot effectively controls mobility and employs three disparate monitoring techniques - complete, selective, and diagnostic - that help produce and maintain an accurate spectrum-condition map for challenging indoor WiFi networks. By adaptively triggering the most suitable of the three techniques, Sybot captures spatio-temporal changes in spectrum condition. Moreover, based on the monitoring results, Sybot automatically determines several key survey parameters, such as site-specific measurement time and space granularities. Sybot has been prototyped with a commodity IEEE 802.11 router and Linux OS, and experimentally evaluated, demonstrating its ability to generate accurate spectrum-condition maps while reducing the measurement effort (space, time) by more than 56%.

Inferring and mitigating a link's hindering transmissions in managed 802.11 wireless networks
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
In 802.11 managed wireless networks, the manager can address under-served links by rate-limiting the conflicting nodes. In order to determine to what extent each conflicting node is responsible for the poor performance, the manager needs to understand the coordination among conflicting nodes' transmissions. In this paper, we present a management framework called MIDAS (Management, Inference, and Diagnostics using Activity Share). We introduce the concept of Activity Share which characterizes the coordination among any set of network nodes in terms of the time they spend transmitting simultaneously. Unfortunately, the Activity Share cannot be locally measured by the nodes. Thus, MIDAS comprises an inference tool which, based on a combined physical, protocol, and statistical approach, infers the Activity Share by using a small set of passively collected, time-aggregate local channel measurements reported by the nodes. MIDAS uses the estimated Activity Share as the input of a simple model that predicts how limiting the transmission rate of any conflicting node would benefit the throughput of the under-served link. The model is based on the current network conditions, thus representing the first throughput model using online measurements. We implemented our tool on real hardware and deployed it on an indoor testbed. Our extensive validation combines testbed experiments and simulations. The results show that MIDAS infers the Activity Share with an average normalized relative error below 12% in all testbed experiments.

The &#954; factor: inferring protocol performance using inter-link reception correlation
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2010
This paper explores metrics that capture to what degree packet reception on different links is correlated. Specifically, it explores metrics that shed light on when and why opportunistic routing and network coding protocols perform well (or badly). It presents a new metric, &#954; that, unlike existing widely used metrics, has no bias based on the packet reception ratios of links. This lack of bias makes &#954; a better predictor of performance of opportunistic routing and network coding protocols. Comparing Deluge and Rateless Deluge, Deluge's network coding counterpart, we find that &#954; can predict which of the two is best suited for a given environment. For example, irrespective of the packet reception ratios of the links, if the average &#954; of the link pairs is very high (close to 1.0), then using a protocol that does not code works better than using a network coding protocol. Measuring &#954; on several 802.15.4 and 802.11 testbeds, we find that it varies significantly across network topologies and link layers. &#954; can be a metric for quantifying what kind of a network is present and help decide which protocols to use for that network.

Toward understanding characteristics of dedicated short range communications (DSRC) from a perspective of vehicular network engineers
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

IEEE 802.11p-based Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) is considered a promising wireless technology for enhancing transportation safety and improving highway efficiency. Here, using a large set of empirical measurement data taken in a rich variety of realistic driving environments, we attempt to characterize communication properties of DSRC as well as to analyze the causes of communication loss. Specifically, from a perspective of vehicular network engineers, the fundamental characteristic of DSRC communications is Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). We investigate the impact of both uncontrollable environmental factors and controllable radio parameters on DSRC characteristics. Moreover, we also examine temporal correlation, spatial correlation and symmetric correlation of DSRC characteristics under realistic vehicular environments.

Profiling users in a 3g network using hourglass co-clustering
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
With widespread popularity of smart phones, more and more users are accessing the Internet on the go. Understanding mobile user browsing behavior is of great significance for several reasons. For example, it can help cellular (data) service providers (CSPs) to improve service performance, thus increasing user satisfaction. It can also provide valuable insights about how to enhance mobile user experience by providing dynamic content personalization and recommendation, or location-aware services. In this paper, we try to understand mobile user browsing behavior by investigating whether there exists distinct "behavior patterns" among mobile users. Our study is based on real mobile network data collected from a large 3G CSP in North America. We formulate this user behavior profiling problem as a "co-clustering" problem, i.e., we group both users (who share similar browsing behavior), and browsing profiles (of like-minded users) simultaneously. We propose and develop a scalable co-clustering methodology, Phantom, using a novel hourglass model. The proposed hourglass model first reduces the dimensions of the input data and performs divisive hierarchical co-clustering on the lower dimensional data; it then carries out an expansion step that restores the original dimensions. Applying Phantom to the mobile network data, we find that there exists a number of prevalent and distinct behavior patterns that persist over time, suggesting that user browsing behavior in 3G cellular networks can be captured using a small number of co-clusters. For instance, behavior of most users can be classified as either homogeneous (users with very limited set of browsing interests) or heterogeneous (users with very diverse browsing interests), and such behavior profiles do not change significantly at either short (30-min) or long (6 hour) time scales.

2010
In this work, we study physical-layer identification of passive UHF RFID tags. We collect signals from a population of 70 tags using a purpose-built reader and we analyze time domain and spectral features of the collected signals. We show that, based on timing features of the signals, UHF RFID tags can be classified, independently of the location and distance to the reader (evaluated up to 6 meters), with an accuracy of approx. 71% (within our population). Additionally, we show that is possible to uniquely identify a maximum of approx. 26 UHF RFID tags independently of the population size. We analyze the implications of these results on tag holder privacy. We further show that, in controlled environments, UHF RFID tags can be uniquely identified based on their signal spectral features with an Equal Error Rate of 0% (within our population); we discuss the application of those techniques to cloning detection in RFID-enabled supply chains.

Back-pressure routing and rate control for ICNs
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
We study a network composed of multiple clusters of wireless nodes. Within each cluster, nodes can communicate directly using the wireless links; however, these clusters are far away such that direct communication between the clusters is impossible except through "mobile" contact nodes. These mobile contact nodes are data carriers that shuffle between clusters and transport data from source to destination clusters. There are several applications of our network model (e.g., clusters of mobile soldiers connected via unmanned aerial vehicles). At the same time, much interest has been garnered by cross-layer design for wireless networks in order to improve efficiency and better allocate resources. In this paper, we focus on queue based cross-layer technique known as back-pressure algorithm. The algorithm is known to be throughput optimal, as well as resilient to disruptions in the network, making it an ideal place to start when designing communication protocols for our intermittently connected network. In this paper, we design a back-pressure routing/rate control algorithm for intermittently connected networks (ICNs). We implement a modified back-pressure routing algorithm on a 16-node experimental test bed, discuss some of the issues regarding design and implementation, and present our experimental results.

Differential forms for target tracking and aggregate queries in distributed networks
Proceedings of the sixteenth annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2010
Consider mobile targets moving in a plane and their movements being monitored by a network such as a field of sensors. We develop distributed algorithms for in-network tracking and range queries for aggregated data (for example returning the number of targets within any user given region). Our scheme stores the target detection information locally in the network, and answers a query by examining the perimeter of the given range. The cost of updating data about mobile targets is proportional to the target displacement. The key insight is to maintain in the sensor network a function with respect to the target detection data on the graph edges that is a differential one-form such that the integral of this one-form along any closed curve C gives the integral within the region bounded by C. The differential one-form has great flexibility making it appropriate for tracking mobile targets. The basic range query can be used to find a nearby target or any given identifiable target with cost O(d) where d is the distance to the target in question. Dynamic insertion, deletion, coverage holes and mobility of sensor nodes can be handled with only local operations, making the scheme suitable for a highly dynamic network. It is extremely robust and capable of tolerating errors in sensing and target localization. Due to limited space, we only elaborate the advantages of differential forms in tracking of mobile targets. The same routine can be applied for organizing many other types of informations, for example streaming scalar sensor data (such as temperature data field), to support efficient range queries. We demonstrate through analysis and simulations that this scheme compares favorably with existing schemes that use location services for answering aggregated range queries of target detection data.

Using smart-macros we design and prototype SmartVNC, a remote computing solution for smartphones. We show using experimental studies and a trace based analysis of real user activity, that SmartVNC can improve user experience considerably.

FERMI: a femtocell resource management system forinterference mitigation in OFDMA networks
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
The demand for increased spectral efficiencies is driving the next generation broadband access networks towards deploying smaller cells (femtocells) with sophisticated air interface technologies (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access or OFDMA). The projected dense deployment of femtocells however, makes interference and hence resource management both critical and extremely challenging. In this paper, we design and implement one of the first resource management systems, FERMI, for OFDMA-based femtocell networks. As part of its design, FERMI (i) provides resource isolation in the frequency domain (as opposed to time) to leverage power pooling across cells to improve capacity; (ii) uses measurement-driven triggers to intelligently distinguish clients that require just link adaptation from those that require resource isolation; (iii) incorporates mechanisms that enable the joint scheduling of both types of clients in the same frame; and (iv) employs efficient, scalable algorithms to determine a fair resource allocation across the entire network with high utilization and low overhead. We implement FERMI on a prototype four-cell WiMAX femtocell testbed and show that it yields significant gains over conventional approaches.

WiFi-Nano: reclaiming WiFi efficiency through 800 ns slots
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
The increase in WiFi physical layer transmission speeds from 1~Mbps to 1 Gbps has reduced transmission times for a 1500 byte packet from 12 ms to 12 us. However, WiFi MAC overheads such as channel access and acks have not seen similar reductions and cumulatively contribute about 150 us on average per packet. Thus, the efficiency of WiFi has deteriorated from over 80% at 1 Mbps to under 10% at 1 Gbps. In this paper, we propose WiFi-Nano, a system that uses 800 ns slots} to significantly improve WiFi efficiency. Reducing slot time from 9 us to 800 ns makes backoffs efficient, but clear channel assessment can no longer be completed in one slot since preamble detection can now take multiple slots. Instead of waiting for multiple slots for detecting preambles, nodes speculatively transmit preambles as their backoff counters expire, while continuing to detect premables using self-interference cancellation. Upon detection of preambles from other transmitters, nodes simply abort their own preamble transmissions, thereby allowing the earliest transmitter to succeed. Further, receivers speculatively transmit their ack preambles at the end of packet reception, thereby reducing ack overhead. We validate the effectiveness of WiFi-Nano through implementation on an FPGA-based software defined radio platform, and through extensive simulations, demonstrate efficiency gains of up to 100%.

XPRESS: a cross-layer backpressure architecture for wireless multi-hop networks
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Contemporary wireless multi-hop networks operate much below their capacity due to the poor coordination among transmitting nodes. In this paper we present XPRESS, a cross-layer backpressure architecture designed to reach the full capacity of wireless multi-hop networks. Instead of a collection of poorly coordinated wireless routers, XPRESS turns a mesh network into a wireless switch. Transmissions over the network are scheduled using a throughput-optimal backpressure algorithm. Realizing this theoretical concept entails several challenges, which we identify and address with a cross-layer design and implementation on top of our wireless hardware platform. In contrast to previous work, we implement and evaluate backpressure scheduling over a TDMA MAC protocol, as it was originally proposed in theory. Our experiments in an indoor testbed show that XPRESS can yield up to 128% throughput gains over 802.11.

CRMA: collision-resistant multiple access
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Efficiently sharing spectrum among multiple users is critical to wireless network performance. In this paper, we propose a novel spectrum sharing protocol called Collision-Resistant Multiple Access (CRMA) to achieve high efficiency. In CRMA, each transmitter views the OFDM physical layer as multiple orthogonal but sharable channels, and independently selects a few channels for transmission. The transmissions that share the same channel naturally add up in the air. The receiver extracts the received signals from all the channels and efficiently decodes the transmissions by solving a simple linear system. We implement our approach in the Qualnet simulator and show that it yields significant improvement over existing spectrum sharing schemes. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using implementation and experiments on GNU Radios.

SociableSense: exploring the trade-offs of adaptive sampling and computation offloading for social sensing
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
The interactions and social relations among users in workplaces have been studied by many generations of social psychologists. There is evidence that groups of users that interact more in workplaces are more productive. However, it is still hard for social scientists to capture fine-grained data about phenomena of this kind and to find the right means to facilitate interaction. It is also difficult for users to keep track of their level of sociability with colleagues. While mobile phones offer a fantastic platform for harvesting long term and fine grained data, they also pose challenges: battery power is limited and needs to be traded-off for sensor reading accuracy and data transmission, while energy costs in processing computationally intensive tasks are high. In this paper, we propose SociableSense, a smart phones based platform that captures user behavior in office environments, while providing the users with a quantitative measure of their sociability and that of colleagues. We tackle the technical challenges of building such a tool: the system provides an adaptive sampling mechanism as well as models to decide whether to perform computation of tasks, such as the execution of classification and inference algorithms, locally or remotely. We perform several micro-benchmark tests to fine-tune and evaluate the performance of these mechanisms and we show that the adaptive sampling and computation distribution schemes balance trade-offs among accuracy, energy, latency, and data traffic. Finally, by means of a social psychological study with ten participants for two working weeks, we demonstrate that SociableSense fosters interactions among the participants and helps in enhancing their sociability.

Overlapping communities in dynamic networks: their detection and mobile applications
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Many practical problems on Mobile networking, such as routing strategies in MANETs, sensor reprogramming in WSNs and worm containment in online social networks (OSNs) share an ubiquitous, yet interesting feature in their organizations: community structure. Knowledge of this structure provides us not only crucial information about the network principles, but also key insights into designing more effective algorithms for practical problems enabled by Mobile networking. However, understanding this interesting feature is extremely challenging on dynamic networks where changes to their topologies are frequently introduced, and especially when network communities in reality usually overlap with each other. We focus on the following questions (1) Can we effectively detect the overlapping community structure in a dynamic network? (2) Can we quickly and adaptively update the network structure only based on its history without recomputing from scratch? (3) How does the detection of network communities help mobile applications? We propose AFOCS, a two-phase framework for not only detecting quickly but also tracing effectively the evolution of overlapped network communities in dynamic mobile networks. With the great advantages of the overlapping community structure, AFOCS significantly helps in reducing up to 7 times the infection rates in worm containment on OSNs, and up to 11 times overhead while maintaining good delivery time and ratio in forwarding strategies in MANETs.

The beeps are spaced in time across the left, right, and if available, front and rear speakers. After sampling the beeps, we use a sequential change-point detection scheme to time their arrival, and then use a differential approach to estimate the phone's distance from the car's center. From these differences a passenger or driver classification can be made. To validate our approach, we experimented with two kinds of phones and in two different cars. We found that our customized beeps were imperceptible to most users, yet still playable and recordable in both cars. Our customized beeps were also robust to background sounds such as music and wind, and we found the signal processing did not require excessive computational resources. In spite of the cars' heavy multi-path environment, our approach had a classification accuracy of over 90%, and around 95% with some calibrations. We also found we have a low false positive rate, on the order of a few percent.

I am the antenna: accurate outdoor AP location using smartphones
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Today's WiFi access points (APs) are ubiquitous, and provide critical connectivity for a wide range of mobile networking devices. Many management tasks, e.g. optimizing AP placement and detecting rogue APs, require a user to efficiently determine the location of wireless APs. Unlike prior localization techniques that require either specialized equipment or extensive outdoor measurements, we propose a way to locate APs in real-time using commodity smartphones. Our insight is that by rotating a wireless receiver (smartphone) around a signal-blocking obstacle (the user's body), we can effectively emulate the sensitivity and functionality of a directional antenna. Our measurements show that we can detect these signal strength artifacts on multiple smartphone platforms for a variety of outdoor environments. We develop a model for detecting signal dips caused by blocking obstacles, and use it to produce a directional analysis technique that accurately predicts the direction of the AP, along with an associated confidence value. The result is Borealis, a system that provides accurate directional guidance and leads users to a desired AP after a few measurements. Detailed measurements show that Borealis is significantly more accurate than other real-time localization systems, and is nearly as accurate as offline approaches using extensive wireless measurements.

Traffic-driven power saving in operational 3G cellular networks
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Base stations (BSes) in the 3G cellular network are not energy proportional with respect to their carried traffic load. Our mea- surements show that 3G traffic exhibits high fluctuations both in time and over space, thus incurring energy waste. In this paper, we propose a profile-based approach to green cellular infrastruc- ture. We profile BS traffic and approximate network-wide energy proportionality using non-load-adaptive BSes. The instrument is to leverage temporal-spatial traffic diversity and node deployment heterogeneity, and power off under-utilized BSes under light traf- fic. Our evaluation on four regional 3G networks shows that this simple scheme yields up to 53% energy savings in a dense large city and 23% in a sparse, mid-sized city.

MOTA: engineering an operator agnostic mobile service
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
There are two emerging trends in the mobile data world. First, mobile data is exploding at a rapid rate with analysts predicting 25-50X growth by the year 2015. The second trend is that users are demanding greater degree of flexibility in selecting their operators at fine timescales. Across Asia, dual-SIM phones have become popular, while Apple is rumored to be designing a Universal SIM that will allow iPhone users to toggle between different operators. This latter trend points towards an impending disruption in wireless service models which could also be the need of the hour from the spectrum shortage perspective. This points towards a new service model where users can choose an operator based on application needs. However, if users make this choice greedily without network assistance, it can exacerbate spectrum scarcity and degrade user experience. In this work, we consider user devices with multiple network interfaces (3G, LTE etc.) that can be simultaneously active and each running multiple applications. We propose the MOTA service model to enable users to associate each interface with the operator of choice at fine time scales. Under the MOTA service model, through concise signalling information, operators provide information about their own network, so that each user can (i) choose a suitable operator for each interface, and (ii) choose an interface for each active application. We make the following contributions in this paper. First, we propose concise network signalling that assists users to make informed choices even under mobility. Second, we develop user-choice algorithms that maximize a suitable notion of user satisfaction while using spectrum resources efficiently. Third, we perform extensive evaluation over actual base station deployment in a city coupled with real signal propagation maps. Our results with two operators show that, MOTA service model provides capacity gain in the range 2.5-4X over the current existing service model. Finally, we argue that our solution is practically implementable by combining appropriate IEEE standards and IETF proposals.

Anonymization of location data does not work: a large-scale measurement study
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
We examine a very large-scale data set of more than 30 billion call records made by 25 million cell phone users across all 50 states of the US and attempt to determine to what extent anonymized location data can reveal private user information. Our approach is to infer, from the call records, the "top N" locations for each user and correlate this information with publicly-available side information such as census data. For example, the measured "top 2" locations likely correspond to home and work locations, the "top 3" to home, work, and shopping/school/commute path locations. We consider the cases where those "top N" locations are measured with different levels of granularity, ranging from a cell sector to whole cell, zip code, city, county and state. We then compute the anonymity set, namely the number of users uniquely identified by a given set of "top N" locations at different granularity levels. We find that the "top 1" location does not typically yield small anonymity sets. However, the top 2 and top 3 locations do, certainly at the sector or cell-level granularity. We consider a variety of different factors that might impact the size of the anonymity set, for example the distance between the "top N" locations or the geographic environment (rural vs urban). We also examine to what extent specific side information, in particular the size of the user's social network, decrease the anonymity set and therefore increase risks to privacy. Our study shows that sharing anonymized location data will likely lead to privacy risks and that, at a minimum, the data needs to be coarse in either the time domain (meaning the data is collected over short periods of time, in which case inferring the top N locations reliably is difficult) or the space domain (meaning the data granularity is strictly higher than the cell level). In both cases, the utility of the anonymized location data will be decreased, potentially by a significant amount.

Enhance & explore: an adaptive algorithm to maximize the utility of wireless networks
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
The goal of jointly providing efficiency and fairness in wireless networks can be seen as the problem of maximizing a given utility function. In contrast with wired networks, the capacity of wireless networks is typically time-varying and not known explicitly. Hence, as the capacity region is impossible to know or measure exactly, existing scheduling schemes either under-estimate it and are too conservative, or they over-estimate it and suffer from congestion collapse. We propose a new adaptive algorithm, called Enhance & Explore (E&E). It maximizes the utility of the network without requiring any explicit characterization of the capacity region. E&E works above the MAC layer and it does not demand any modification to the existing networking stack. We first evaluate our algorithm theoretically and we prove that it converges to a state of optimal utility. We then evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a WLAN setting, using both simulations and real measurements on a testbed composed of IEEE 802.11 wireless routers. Finally, we investigate a wireless mesh network setting and we find that, when coupled with an efficientmechanismfor congestioncontrol, the E&E algorithm greatly increases the utility achieved by multi-hop networks as well.

Scoop: decentralized and opportunistic multicasting of information streams
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
We consider the problem of delivering information streams to interested mobile users, leveraging both access to the infrastructure and device-to-device data transfers. The goal is to design practical relaying algorithms that aim at optimizing a global system objective that accounts for two important aspects: first, the user interest in content with respect to its type and delivery time; and, second, resource constraints such as storage and transmission costs. We first examine a set of real-world datasets reporting contacts between users moving in relatively restricted geographic areas (e.g. a city). These datasets provide evidence that significant performance gains can be achieved by extending the information dissemination from one to two hops, and that using longer paths only brings marginal benefits. We also show that correlation of delays through different paths is typically significant, thus asking for system design that would allow for general user mobility. We then propose a class of relaying strategies (referred to as SCOOP) that aim at optimizing a global system objective, are fully decentralized, require only locally observable states by individual devices, and allow for general user mobility. These properties characterize a practical scheme whose efficiency is evaluated using real-world mobility traces.

R3: robust replication routing in wireless networks with diverse connectivity characteristics
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Our work is motivated by a simple question: can we design a simple routing protocol that ensures robust performance across networks with diverse connectivity characteristics such as meshes, MANETs, and DTNs? We identify packet replication as a key structural difference between protocols designed for opposite ends of the connectivity spectrum---DTNs and meshes. We develop a model to quantify under what conditions and by how much replication improves packet delays, and use these insights to drive the design of R3, a routing protocol that self-adapts replication to the extent of uncertainty in network path delays. We implement and deploy R3 on a mesh testbed and a DTN testbed. To the best of our knowledge, R3 is the first routing protocol to be deployed and evaluated on both a DTN testbed and a mesh testbed. We evaluate its performance through deployment, trace-driven simulations, and emulation experiments. Our results show that R3 achieves significantly better delay and goodput over existing protocols in a variety of network connectivity and load conditions.

Flooding-resilient broadcast authentication for VANETs
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Digital signatures are one of the fundamental security primitives in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) because they provide authenticity and non-repudiation in broadcast communication. However, the current broadcast authentication standard in VANETs is vulnerable to signature flooding: excessive signature verification requests that exhaust the computational resources of victims. In this paper, we propose two efficient broadcast authentication schemes, Fast Authentication (FastAuth) and Selective Authentication (SelAuth), as two countermeasures to signature flooding. FastAuth secures periodic single-hop beacon messages. By exploiting the sender's ability to predict its own future beacons, FastAuth enables 50 times faster verification than previous mechanisms using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. SelAuth secures multi-hop applications in which a bogus signature may spread out quickly and impact a significant number of vehicles. SelAuth pro- vides fast isolation of malicious senders, even under a dynamic topology, while consuming only 15%--30% of the computational resources compared to other schemes. We provide both analytical and experimental evaluations based on real traffic traces and NS-2 simulations. With the near-term deployment plans of VANET on all vehicles, our approaches can make VANETs practical.

E-MiLi: energy-minimizing idle listening in wireless networks
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
WiFi interface is known to be a primary energy consumer in mobile devices, and idle listening (IL) is the dominant source of energy consumption in WiFi. Most existing protocols, such as the 802.11 power-saving mode (PSM), attempt to reduce the time spent in IL by sleep scheduling. However, through an extensive analysis of real-world traffic, we found more than 60% of energy is consumed in IL, even with PSM enabled. To remedy this problem, we propose E-MiLi (Energy-Minimizing idle Listening) that reduces the power consumption in IL, given that the time spent in IL has already been optimized by sleep scheduling. Observing that radio power consumption decreases proportionally to its clock-rate, E-MiLi adaptively downclocks the radio during IL, and reverts to full clock-rate when an incoming packet is detected or a packet has to be transmitted. E-MiLi incorporates sampling rate invariant detection, ensuring accurate packet detection and address filtering even when the receiver's sampling clock-rate is much lower than the signal bandwidth. Further, it employs an opportunistic downclocking mechanism to optimize the efficiency of switching clock-rate, based on a simple interface to existing MAC-layer scheduling protocols. We have implemented E-MiLi on the USRP software radio platform. Our experimental evaluation shows that E-MiLi can detect packets with close to 100% accuracy even with downclocking by a factor of 16. When integrated with 802.11, E-MiLi can reduce energy consumption by around 44% for 92% of users in real-world wireless networks.

REfactor-ing content overhearing to improve wireless performance
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Many systems have leveraged the broadcast nature of wireless radios to improve wireless capacity and performance. While conventional approaches have focused on overhearing entire packets, recent designs have argued that focusing on overheard content may be more effective. Unfortunately, key design choices in these approaches limit them from fully leveraging the benefits of overhearing content. We propose a cleaner refactoring of functionality where-in overhearing is realized at the sub-packet payload level through the use of IP-layer redundancy elimination. We show that this dramatically improves the effectiveness of prior overhearing based approaches and enables new designs, e.g., enhanced network coding, where content overhearing can be more effectively integrated to improve performance. Realizing the benefits of IP-layer content overhearing requires us to overcome challenges arising from the probabilistic nature of wireless reception (which could lead to inconsistent state) and the limited resources on wireless devices. We overcome these challenges through careful data structure and wireless redundancy elimination designs. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system using experimentation on real traces. We find that our design is highly effective: e.g., it can improve goodput by nearly 25% and air time utilization by nearly 20%.

Distributed spectrum management and relay selection in interference-limited cooperative wireless networks
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
It is well known that the data transport capacity of a wireless network can be increased by leveraging the spatial and frequency diversity of the wireless transmission medium. This has motivated the recent surge of research in cooperative and  dynamic-spectrum-access networks. Still, as of today, a key open research challenge is to design distributed control strategies to dynamically jointly assign (i) portions of the spectrum and (ii) cooperative relays to different traffic sessions to maximize the resulting network-wide data rate. In this article, we make a significant contribution in this direction. First, we mathematically formulate the problem of joint spectrum management and relay selection for a set of sessions concurrently utilizing an interference-limited infrastructure-less wireless network. We then study distributed solutions to this (nonlinear and nonconvex) problem. The overall problem is separated into two subproblems, (i) spectrum management through power allocation with given relay selection strategy, and (ii) relay selection for a given spectral profile. Distributed solutions for each of the two subproblems are proposed, which are then analyzed based on notions from variational inequality (VI) theory. The distributed algorithms can be proven to converge, under certain conditions, to VI solutions, which are also Nash equilibrium (NE) solutions of the equivalent NE problems. A distributed algorithm based on iterative solution of the two subproblems is then designed. Performance and price of anarchy of the distributed algorithm are then studied by comparing it to the globally optimal solution obtained with a centralized algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed algorithm achieves performance that is within a few percentage points of the optimal solution.

No time to countdown: migrating backoff to the frequency domain
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Conventional WiFi networks perform channel contention in time domain. This is known to be wasteful because the channel is forced to remain idle while all contending nodes are backing off for multiple time slots. This paper proposes to break away from convention and recreate the backing off operation in the frequency domain. Our basic idea leverages the observation that OFDM subcarriers can be treated as integer numbers. Thus, instead of picking a random backoff duration in time, a contending node can signal on a randomly chosen subcarrier. By employing a second antenna to listen to all the subcarriers, each node can determine whether its chosen integer (or subcarrier) is the smallest among all others. In fact, each node can even determine the rank of its chosen subcarrier, enabling the feasibility of scheduled transmissions after every round of contention. We develop these ideas into a Back2F protocol that migrates WiFi backoff to the frequency domain. Experiments on a prototype of 10 USRPs confirm feasibility, along with consistent throughput gains over 802.11. at high bit rates. Trace based simulations affirm scalability to larger, real-world network topologies.

Harnessing frequency diversity in wi-fi networks
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Wireless multicarrier communication systems transmit data by spreading it over multiple subcarriers and are widely used today owing to their robustness to multipath fading, high spectrum efficiency, and ease of implementation. In this paper, we use real measurements to show there is significant frequency diversity in Wi-Fi channels, and propose a series of techniques to explicitly harness such frequency diversity. In particular, we leverage the Channel State Information (CSI), which captures the SNR on each subcarrier to (i) map symbols to subcarriers according to their importance, (ii) effectively recover partially corrupted FEC groups and facilitate FEC decoding, and (iii) develop MAC-layer FEC to offer different degrees of protection to the symbols according to their error rates at the PHY layer. We further develop a rate adaptation approach that works together with these optimization schemes. Our trace-driven simulation and testbed experiments based on USRP clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

Beamforming on mobile devices: a first study
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
In this work, we report the first study of an important realization of directional communication, beamforming, on mobile devices. We first demonstrate that beamforming is already feasible on mobile devices in terms of form factor, device mobility and power efficiency. Surprisingly, we show that by making an increasingly profitable tradeoff between transmit and circuit power, beamforming with state-of-the-art integrated CMOS implementations can be more power-efficient than its single antenna counterpart. We then investigate the optimal way of using beamforming in terms of device power efficiency, by allowing a dynamic number of active antennas. We propose a simple yet effective solution, BeamAdapt, which allows each mobile client in a network to individually identify the optimal number of active antennas with guaranteed convergence and close-to-optimal performance. We finally report a WARP-based prototype of BeamAdapt and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness in realistic environments, and then complement the prototype-based experiments with Qualnet-based simulation of a large-scale network. Our results show that BeamAdapt with four antennas can reduce the power consumption of mobile clients by more than half compared to a single antenna, while maintaining a required network throughput.

FlexCast: graceful wireless video streaming
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Video streaming performance on wireless networks is choppy. The culprit is the unpredictable wireless medium, whose fluctuations results in fluctuating throughput and bit errors. Current video codecs are not equipped to handle such variations since they exhibit an all or nothing behavior. If the channel is strong and above a threshold, the video stream gets decoded perfectly. If not, typically nothing gets decoded. Thus, there is no graceful degradation with wireless conditions. In this paper, we present a new technique FlexCast, that delivers a video reconstruction whose quality automatically varies with the channel conditions. The key idea is a novel joint-source channel code, that allows the sender to continuously transmit video bits, and the receiver to decode a video quality corresponding to the number of bits it receives and the instantaneous wireless channel quality. We show via experimental evaluation that name performs almost as well as the optimal scheme, and outperforms the state of the art graceful video delivery systems by nearly 6dB PSNR.

A cross-layer design for scalable mobile video
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Today's mobile video suffers from two limitations: 1) it cannot reduce bandwidth consumption by leveraging wireless broadcast to multicast popular content to interested receivers, and 2) it lacks robustness to wireless interference and errors. This paper presents SoftCast, a cross-layer design for mobile video that addresses both limitations. To do so, SoftCast changes the network stack to act like a linear transform. As a result, the transmitted video signal becomes linearly related to the pixels' luminance. Thus, when noise perturbs the transmitted signal samples, the perturbation naturally translates into approximation in the original video pixels. This enables a video source to multicast a single stream that each receiver decodes to a video quality commensurate with its channel quality. It also increases robustness to interference and errors which now reduce the sharpness of the received pixels but do not cause the video to glitch or stall. We have implemented SoftCast and evaluated it in a testbed of software radios. Our results show that it improves the average video quality for multicast users by 5.5dB, eliminates video glitches caused by mobility, and increases robustness to packet loss by an order of magnitude.

Practical, real-time, full duplex wireless
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
This paper presents a full duplex radio design using signal inversion and adaptive cancellation. Signal inversion uses a simple design based on a balanced/unbalanced (Balun) transformer. This new design, unlike prior work, supports wideband and high power systems. In theory, this new design has no limitation on bandwidth or power. In practice, we find that the signal inversion technique alone can cancel at least 45dB across a 40MHz bandwidth. Further, combining signal inversion cancellation with cancellation in the digital domain can reduce self-interference by up to 73dB for a 10MHz OFDM signal. This paper also presents a full duplex medium access control (MAC) design and evaluates it using a testbed of 5 prototype full duplex nodes. Full duplex reduces packet losses due to hidden terminals by up to 88%. Full duplex also mitigates unfair channel allocation in AP-based networks, increasing fairness from 0.85 to 0.98 while improving downlink throughput by 110% and uplink throughput by 15%. These experimental results show that a re- design of the wireless network stack to exploit full duplex capability can result in significant improvements in network performance.

Understanding stateful vs stateless communication strategies for ad hoc networks
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
Structural change and uncertainty are fundamental properties of an ad hoc network, making it difficult to develop communication strategies, i.e., network-level approaches to transport data from sender to receiver. At a basic level, change and uncertainty affect how long any state maintained by a communication strategy remains useful, and so influence the trade-offs made to collect that state. In this paper, we introduce a framework for organizing the decision space for deciding when a communication strategy should maintain state, and what type of state should be maintained, in an ad hoc network. The framework is based on our observation that three network properties (connectivity, unpredictability, and resource contention) determine when state is useful. Using the framework, we make three contributions. First, we illustrate the framework by showing an instantiation in terms of specific measures that can be used to describe a network setting. Second, we validate the framework by showing it correctly and consistently organizes the decision space for different communication strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the analytic power of the framework by using it to (1) uncover surprising aspects of well-known traces, and (2) identify the need for, and value of, a new strategy for network communication.

Optimal gateway selection in multi-domain wireless networks: a potential game perspective
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2011
We consider a coalition network where multiple groups are interconnected via wireless links. Gateway nodes are designated by each domain to achieve a network-wide interoperability. Due to the inter-domain communication cost, the optimal gateway selection for one single domain depends on the gateway selections of other domains and vice versa. In this paper, we investigate the interactions of gateway selections by multiple domains from a potential game perspective. The equilibrium inefficiency in terms of price of stability is characterized under various conditions. In addition, we examine the well-established equilibrium selective learning algorithm B-logit and show that B-logit is a special case of a general family of algorithms, denoted by &#915; collectively. A novel learning algorithm named MAX-logit is proposed, which retains the favorable equilibrium selection property with the provably fastest convergence speed than any other algorithms in &#915;, and can be applied to many other applications of potential games. Simulation results show that MAX-logit can improve the convergence speed of B-logit by up to 33.85%.

Fundamental relationship between NodeDensity and delay in wireless ad hoc networks with unreliable links
Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2011
We investigate the fundamental relationship between node density and transmission delay in large-scale wireless ad hoc networks with unreliable links from percolation perspective. Previous works[11][2][10] have already showed the relationship between transmission delay and distance from source to destination. However, it still remains as an open question how transmission delay varies in accordance with node density. Answering this question can provide guidance for determining the number of nodes to meet the delay requirement when designing ad hoc networks. In this paper, we study the impact of node density &#955; on the ratio of delay and distance, denoted by &#947;(&#955;). We analytically characterize the properties of &#947;(&#955;) as a function of &#955;. And then we present upper and lower bounds to &#947;(&#955;). Next, we take propagation delay into consideration and obtain further results on the upper and lower bounds of &#947;(&#955;). Finally, we make simulations to verify our theoretical analysis.

Three theories for delays, clocks and security in wireless networks
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
We propose three theories, which can be regarded as attempts to characterize and establish guaranteed properties of wireless networks: (i) How and to what extent can we deliver packets with hard delay bounds? (ii) How and to what extent can we synchronize clocks in wireless networks? (iii) Can we develop provably secure protocols for the entire life-cycle of wireless networks that also optimize a utility measure while operating in a hostile environment? For the first problem, consider an access point serving several clients over unreliable wireless links. Suppose packets arrive for/from the clients, with each packet having a hard deadline, after which it is dropped. We characterize precisely the mix of delivery ratios, channel unreliabilities and hard deadline that the access point can guarantee, under some models. For the second problem, consider a wireless network where clocks at the nodes are linear, though with different rates (skews) and offsets. Nodes can exchange packets with their neighbors, with direction dependent delays. We characterize precisely to what extent clocks can and cannot be synchronized and delays determined. Under a random model the end-to-end error can be kept bounded irrespective of network size. Concerning the third problem, traditionally, wireless protocols have been developed to provide performance. As attacks are identified, the protocols are fortified against the identified vulnerabilities. However, holistic guarantees are not provided against other attacks. We seek to reverse this paradigm. We propose a provable approach that guarantees the protocol suite is secure when the nodes are subject to certain assumptions. The protocols take a set of good nodes mingled with unknown malicious nodes from primordial birth to an operating network, while attaining min-max of a utility function. The maximization is over protocols announced and followed by the good nodes, and the minimization is over all behaviors of the malicious nodes. Further, the malicious nodes are reduced to either cooperating or jamming. [Joint work with Vivek Borkar, Nikolaos Freris, Scott Graham, I-Hong Hou, Yih-Chun Hu, Jonathan Ponniah and Roberto Solis].

AutoMAC: rateless wireless concurrent medium access
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Current wireless network design is built on the ethos of avoiding interference. In this paper we question this long-held design principle. We show that with appropriate design, successful concurrent transmissions can be enabled and exploited on both the uplink and downlink. We show that this counter-intuitive approach of encouraging interference can be exploited to increase network capacity significantly and simplify network design. We design and implement name, a novel MAC and PHY protocol that exploits recently proposed rateless coding techniques to provide such concurrency. We show via a prototype implementation and experimental evaluation that name can provide a 60% increase in network capacity on the uplink compared to traditional Wifi that does omniscient rate adaptation and a $35\%$ median throughput gain on the downlink PHY layer as compared to an omniscient scheme that picks the best conventional bitrate.

No symbol left behind: a link-layer protocol for rateless codes
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Recently, rateless codes have introduced a promising approach to obtaining wireless throughput higher than what is achieved by fixed-rate codes, especially over time-varying channels. Rateless codes like Raptor, Strider, and spinal codes naturally process all the information available at the receiver corresponding to a packet, whether from one or many frame transmissions. However, a profitable deployment of rateless codes in a wireless network requires a link-layer protocol to coordinate between sender and receiver. This protocol needs to determine how much coded data should be sent before the sender pauses for feedback from the receiver. Without such feedback, an open-loop sender would not know when the packet has been decoded, but sending this feedback is not free and consumes a significant fraction of the packet transmission time. This paper develops RateMore, a protocol that learns the probability distribution of the number of symbols required to decode a packet (the decoding CDF), and uses the learned distribution in a dynamic programming strategy to produce an optimal transmission schedule. Our experiments show that RateMore reduces overhead by between 2.6x and 3.9x compared to 802.11-style ARQ and between 2.8x and 5.4x compared to 3GPP-style "Try-after-n" HARQ.

Rate adaptation for 802.11 multiuser mimo networks
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
In multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) networks, the optimal bit rate of a user is highly dynamic and changes from one packet to the next. This breaks traditional bit rate adaptation algorithms, which rely on recent history to predict the best bit rate for the next packet. To address this problem, we introduce TurboRate, a rate adaptation scheme for MU-MIMO LANs. TurboRate shows that clients in a MU-MIMO LAN can adapt their bit rate on a per-packet basis if each client learns two variables: its SNR when it transmits alone to the access point, and the direction along which its signal is received at the AP. TurboRate also shows that each client can compute these two variables passively without exchanging control frames with the access point. A TurboRate client then annotates its packets with these variables to enable other clients to pick the optimal bit rate and transmit concurrently to the AP. A prototype implementation in USRP-N200 shows that traditional rate adaptation does not deliver the gains of MU-MIMO WLANs, and can interact negatively with MU-MIMO, leading to low throughput. In contrast, enabling MU-MIMO with TurboRate provides a mean throughput gain of 1.7x and 2.3x, for 2-antenna and 3-antenna APs respectively.

A distributed MIMO system consists of several access points connected to a central server and operating as a large distributed multi-antenna access point. In theory, such a system enjoys all the significant performance gains of a traditional MIMO system, and it may be deployed in an enterprise WiFi like setup. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of such a system in practice. Specifically, we build upon our prior work on developing a distributed MIMO testbed, and study the performance of such a system when both full channel state information is available to the transmitters and when no channel state information is available. In the full channel state information scenario, we implement Zero-Forcing Beamforming (ZFBF) and Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP) which is provably near-optimal in high SNR conditions. In the scenario where no channel information is available, we implement Blind Interference Alignment (BIA), which achieves a higher multiplexing gain (degrees of freedom) than conventional TDMA. Our experimental results show that the performance of our implementation is very close to the theoretically predicted performance and offers significant gains over optimal TDMA. We also discuss medium access layer issues in detail for both scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the theoretical high data rates of multiuser MIMO systems have been showcased in a real world distributed MIMO testbed.

Argos: practical many-antenna base stations
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Multi-user multiple-input multiple-output theory predicts manyfold capacity gains by leveraging many antennas on wireless base stations to serve multiple clients simultaneously through multi-user beamforming (MUBF). However, realizing a base station with a large number antennas is non-trivial, and has yet to be achieved in the real-world. We present the design, realization, and evaluation of Argos, the first reported base station architecture that is capable of serving many terminals simultaneously through MUBF with a large number of antennas (M &#62;&#62; 10). Designed for extreme flexibility and scalability, Argos exploits hierarchical and modular design principles, properly partitions baseband processing, and holistically considers real-time requirements of MUBF. Argos employs a novel, completely distributed, beamforming technique, as well as an internal calibration procedure to enable implicit beamforming with channel estimation cost independent of the number of base station antennas. We report an Argos prototype with 64 antennas and capable of serving 15 clients simultaneously. We experimentally demonstrate that by scaling from 1 to 64 antennas the prototype can achieve up to 6.7 fold capacity gains while using a mere 1/64th of the transmission power.

802.11ec: collision avoidance without control messages
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate 802.11ec (Encoded Control), an 802.11-based protocol without control messages: instead, 802.11ec employs correlatable symbol sequences, which together with the timing the codes are transmitted, encode all control information and change the fundamental design properties of the MAC. The use of correlatable symbol sequences provides two key advantages: (i) efficiency, as it permits a near order of magnitude reduction of the control time; (ii) robustness, because codes are short and easily detectable even at low SINR and even while a neighbor is transmitting data. We implement 802.11ec on an FPGA-based software defined radio. We perform a large number of experiments and show that, compared to 802.11 (with and without RTS/CTS), 802.11ec achieves a vast efficiency gain in conveying control information and resolves key throughput and fairness problems in the presence of hidden terminals, asymmetric topologies, and general multi-hop topologies.

SimpleMAC: a jamming-resilient MAC-layer protocol for wireless channel coordination
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
In wireless networks, users share a transmission medium. To increase the efficiency of channel usage, wireless systems often use a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to perform channel coordination by having each node announce its usage intentions; other nodes avoid making conflicting transmissions minimizing interference both to the node that has announced its intentions and to a node that cooperates by avoiding transmissions during the reserved slot. Traditionally, in a multi-channel environment, such announcements are made on a common control channel. However, this control channel is vulnerable to jamming because its location is pre-assigned and known to attackers. Furthermore, the announcements themselves provide information useful for jamming. In this paper, we focus on a situation where multiple wireless transmitters share spectrum in the presence of intelligent and possibly insider jammers capable of dynamically and adaptively changing their jamming patterns. We develop a framework for effectively countering MAC-aware jamming attacks and then propose SimpleMAC, a protocol resilient to these attacks. SimpleMAC consists of two schemes (the Simple Transmitter Strategy and the Simple Signaling Scheme) that are easily analyzed using game theory, and show the optimal adversarial behavior under these protocols. We evaluate our schemes mathematically, through Monte Carlo simulations, and by implementation on the WARP software-defined radio platform. SimpleMAC provides very rapid improvement over the alternative of not using any MAC protocol, and eventually converges to optimal performance (over six-fold improvement in SINR, 50% gains in Shannon capacity in a realistic mobile scenario).

Frame retransmissions considered harmful: improving spectrum efficiency using Micro-ACKs
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Retransmissions reduce the efficiency of data communication in wireless networks because of: (i) per-retransmission packet headers, (ii) contention overhead on every retransmission, and (iii) redundant bits in every retransmission. In fact, every retransmission nearly doubles the time to successfully deliver the packet. To improve spectrum efficiency in a lossy environment, we propose a new in-frame retransmission scheme using uACKs. Instead of waiting for the entire transmission to end before sending the ACK, the receiver sends smaller uACKs for every few symbols, on a separate narrow feedback channel. Based on these uACKs, the sender only retransmits the lost symbols after the last data symbol in the frame, thereby adaptively changing the frame size to ensure it is successfully delivered. We have implemented uACK on the Sora platform. Experiments with our prototype validate the feasibility of symbol-level uACK . By significantly reducing the retransmistion overhead, the sender is able to aggressively use higher data rate for a lossy link. Both improve the overall network efficiency. Our experimental results from a controlled environment and an 9-node software radio testbed show that uACK can have up to 140% throughput gain over 802.11g and up to 60% gain over the best known retransmission scheme.

RadioJockey: mining program execution to optimize cellular radio usage
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Many networked applications that run in the background on a mobile device incur significant energy drains when using the cellular radio interface for communication. This is mainly due to the radio-tail, where the cellular radio remaining in a high energy state for up to 20s after each communication spurt. In order to cut down energy consumption, many recent devices employ fast dormancy, a feature that forces the client radio to quickly go into a low energy state after a fixed short idle period. However, aggressive idle timer values for fast dormancy can increase signaling overhead due to frequent state transitions, which negatively impacts the network. In this work, we have designed and implemented RadioJockey, a system that uses program execution traces to predict the end of communication spurts, thereby accurately invoking fast dormancy without increasing network signaling load. We evaluate RadioJockey on a broad range of background applications and show that it achieves 20-40\% energy savings with negligible increase in signaling overhead compared to fixed idle timer-based approaches.

Can we pay for what we get in 3G data access?
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Data-plan subscribers are charged based on the used traffic volume in 3G/4G cellular networks. This usage-based charging system has been operational and received general success. In this work, we conduct experiments to critically assess both this usage-based accounting architecture and application-specific charging policies by operators. Our evaluation compares the network-recorded volume with the delivered traffic at the end device. We have found that, both generally work in common scenarios but may go wrong in the extreme cases: We are charged for what we never get, and we can get what we want for free. In one extreme case, we are charged for at least three hours and 450MB or more data despite receiving no single bit. In another extreme case, we are able to transfer 200MB or any amount we specify for free. The root causes lie in lack of both coordination between the charging system and the end device, and prudent policy enforcement by certain operators. We propose immediate fixes and discuss possible future directions.

CloudIQ: a framework for processing base stations in a data center
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
The cellular industry is evaluating architectures to distribute the signal processing in radio access networks. One of the options is to process the signals of all base stations on a shared pool of compute resources in a central location. In this centralized architecture, the existing base stations will be replaced with just the antennas and a few other active RF components, and the remainder of the digital processing including the physical layer will be carried out in a central location. This model has potential benefits that include a reduction in the cost of operating the network due to fewer site visits, easy upgrades, and lower site lease costs, and an improvement in the network performance with joint signal processing techniques that span multiple base stations. Further there is a potential to exploit variations in the processing load across base stations, to pool the base stations into fewer compute resources, thereby allowing the operator to either reduce energy consumption by turning the remaining processors off or reducing costs by provisioning fewer compute resources. We focus on this aspect in this paper. Specifically, we make the following contributions in the paper. Based on real-world data, we characterise the potential savings if shared homogeneous compute resources are used to process the signals from multiple base stations in the centralized architecture. We show that the centralized architecture can potentially result in savings of at least 22 % in compute resources by exploiting the variations in the processing load across base stations. These savings are achievable with statistical guarantees on successfully processing the base station's signals. We also design a framework that has two objectives: (i) partitioning the set of base stations into groups that are simultaneously processed on a shared homogeneous compute platform for a given statistical guarantee, and (ii) scheduling the set of base stations allocated to a platform in order to meet their real-time processing requirements. This partitioning and scheduling framework saves up to 19 % of the compute resources for a probability of failure of one in 100 million. We refer to this solution as CloudIQ. Finally we implement and extensively evaluate the CloudIQ framework with a 3GPP compliant implementation of 5 MHz LTE.

ProfileDroid: multi-layer profiling of android applications
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
The Android platform lacks tools for assessing and monitoring apps in a systematic way. This lack of tools is particularly problematic when combined with the open nature of Google Play, the main app distribution channel. As our key contribution, we design and implement ProfileDroid, a comprehensive, multi-layer system for monitoring and profiling apps. Our approach is arguably the first to profile apps at four layers: (a) static, or app specification, (b) user interaction, (c) operating system, and (d) network. We evaluate 27 free and paid Android apps and make several observations: (a) we identify discrepancies between the app specification and app execution, (b) free versions of apps could end up costing more than their paid counterparts, due to an order of magnitude increase in traffic, (c) most network traffic is not encrypted, (d) apps communicate with many more sources than users might expect---as many as 13, and (e) we find that 22 out of 27 apps communicate with Google during execution. ProfileDroid is the first step towards a systematic approach for (a) generating cost-effective but comprehensive app profiles, and (b) identifying inconsistencies and surprising behaviors.

Building efficient spectrum-agile devices for dummies
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Spectrum management and device coordination for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) networks have received significant research attention. However, current wireless devices have yet to fully embrace DSA networks due to the difficulties in realizing spectrum-agile communications. We address the practical hurdles and present solutions towards implementing DSA devices, answering an important question "what is a simple practical extension to current wireless devices that makes them spectrum-agile?" To this end, we propose RODIN, a general per-frame spectrum-shaping protocol that has the following features to support DSA in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless devices: (a) direct manipulation of passband signals from COTS devices, (b) fast FPGA-based spectrum shaping, and (c) a novel preamble design for spectrum agreement. RODIN uses an FPGA-based spectrum shaper together with a preamble I-FOP to achieve per-frame spectrum shaping with a delay of under 10 &#956; s.

Asymmetric caching: improved network deduplication for mobile devices
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Network deduplication (dedup) is an attractive approach to improve network performance for mobile devices. With traditional deduplication, the dedup~source uses only the portion of the cache at the dedup~destination that it is aware of. We argue in this work that in a mobile environment, the dedup~destination (say the mobile) could have accumulated a much larger cache than what the current dedup~source is aware of. This can occur because of several reasons ranging from the mobile consuming content through heterogeneous wireless technologies, to the mobile moving across different wireless networks. In this context, we propose asymmetric caching, a solution that is overlaid on baseline network deduplication, but which allows the dedup~destination to selectively feedback appropriate portions of its cache to the dedup~source with the intent of improving the redundancy elimination efficiency. We show using traffic traces collected from 30 mobile users, that with asymmetric caching, over 89% of the achievable redundancy can be identified and eliminated even when the dedup~source has less than one hundredth of the cache size as the dedup~destination. Further, we show that the ratio of bytes saved from transmission at the dedup~source because of asymmetric caching is over 6x that of the number of bytes sent as feedback. Finally, with a prototype implementation of asymmetric caching on both a Linux laptop and an Android smartphone, we demonstrate that the solution is deployable with reasonable CPU and memory overheads.

Crowdsourcing to smartphones: incentive mechanism design for mobile phone sensing
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Mobile phone sensing is a new paradigm which takes advantage of the pervasive smartphones to collect and analyze data beyond the scale of what was previously possible. In a mobile phone sensing system, the platform recruits smartphone users to provide sensing service. Existing mobile phone sensing applications and systems lack good incentive mechanisms that can attract more user participation. To address this issue, we design incentive mechanisms for mobile phone sensing. We consider two system models: the platform-centric model where the platform provides a reward shared by participating users, and the user-centric model where users have more control over the payment they will receive. For the platform-centric model, we design an incentive mechanism using a Stackelberg game, where the platform is the leader while the users are the followers. We show how to compute the unique Stackelberg Equilibrium, at which the utility of the platform is maximized, and none of the users can improve its utility by unilaterally deviating from its current strategy. For the user-centric model, we design an auction-based incentive mechanism, which is computationally efficient, individually rational, profitable, and truthful. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance and validate the theoretical properties of our incentive mechanisms.

Searchlight: won't you be my neighbor?
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
The rapid deployment of millions of mobile sensors and smartphones has resulted in a demand for opportunistic encounter-based networking to support mobile social networking applications and proximity-based gaming. However, the success of these emerging networks is limited by the lack of effective and energy efficient neighbor discovery protocols. While probabilistic approaches perform well for the average case, they exhibit long tails resulting in high upper bounds on neighbor discovery time. Recent deterministic protocols, which allow nodes to wake up at specific timeslots according to a particular pattern, improve on the worst case bound, but do so by sacrificing average case performance. In response to these limitations, we have designed Searchlight, a highly effective asynchronous discovery protocol that is built on three basic ideas. First, it leverages the constant offset between periodic awake slots to design a simple probing-based approach to ensure discovery. Second, it allows awake slots to cover larger sections of time, which ultimately reduces total awake time drastically. Finally, Searchlight has the option to employ probabilistic techniques with its deterministic approach that can considerably improve its performance in the average case when all nodes have the same duty cycle. We validate Searchlight through analysis and real-world experiments on smartphones that show considerable improvement (up to 50%) in worst-case discovery latency over existing approaches in almost all cases, irrespective of duty cycle symmetry.

Distinguishing users with capacitive touch communication
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
As we are surrounded by an ever-larger variety of post-PC devices, the traditional methods for identifying and authenticating users have become cumbersome and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a capacitive communication method through which a device can recognize who is interacting with it. This method exploits the capacitive touchscreens, which are now used in laptops, phones, and tablets, as a signal receiver. The signal that identifies the user can be generated by a small transmitter embedded into a ring, watch, or other artifact carried on the human body. We explore two example system designs with a low-power continuous transmitter that communicates through the skin and a signet ring that needs to be touched to the screen. Experiments with our prototype transmitter and tablet receiver show that capacitive communication through a touchscreen is possible, even without hardware or firmware modifications on a receiver. This latter approach imposes severe limits on the data rate, but the rate is sufficient for differentiating users in multiplayer tablet games or parental control applications. Controlled experiments with a signal generator also indicate that future designs may be able to achieve datarates that are useful for providing less obtrusive authentication with similar assurance as PIN codes or swipe patterns commonly used on smartphones today.

MuVi: a multicast video delivery scheme for 4g cellular networks
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Although wireless broadband technologies have evolved significantly over the past decade, they are still insufficient to support the fast-growing mobile traffic, especially due to the increasing popularity of mobile video applications. Wireless multicast, aiming to exploit the wireless broadcast advantage, is a viable approach to bridge the gap between the limited wireless networking capacity and the ever-increasing mobile video traffic demand. In this work, we propose MuVi, a Multicast Video delivery scheme in OFDMA-based 4G wireless networks, to optimize multicast video traffic. MuVi differentiates video frames based on their importance in reconstructing the video and incorporates an efficient radio resource allocation algorithm to optimize the overall video quality across all users in the multicast group. MuVi is a lightweight solution with most of the implementation in the gateway, slight modification in the base-station, and no modification at the clients. We implement MuVi on a WiMAX testbed and compare its performance to a Naive wireless multicast scheme that employs the most robust MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme), and an Adaptive scheme that employs the highest MCS supportable by all clients. Experimental results show that MuVi improves the average video PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) by up to 13 and 7 dB compared to the Naive and the Adaptive schemes, respectively. MuVi does not require modification to the video encoding scheme or the air interface. Thus it allows speedy deployment in existing systems.

Temporal quality assessment for mobile videos
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Video quality assessment in mobile devices, for instances smart phones and tablets, raises unique challenges such as unavailability of original videos, the limited computation power of mobile devices and inherent characteristics of wireless networks (packet loss and delay). In this paper, we present a metric, Temporal Variation Metric (TVM), to measure the temporal information of videos. Despite its simplicity, it shows a high correlation coefficient of 0.875 to optical flow which captures all motion information in a video. We use the TVM values to derive a reduced-reference temporal quality assessment metric, Temporal Variation Index (TVI), which quantifies the quality degradation incurred in network transmission. Subjective assessments demonstrate that TVI is a very good predictor of users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Its prediction shows a 92.5% of correlation to subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings. Through video streaming experiments, we show that TVI can also estimate the network conditions such as packet loss and delay. It depicts an accuracy of almost 95% in extensive tests on 183 video traces.

ParCast: soft video delivery in MIMO-OFDM WLANs
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
We observe two trends, growing wireless capability at the physical layer powered by MIMO-OFDM, and growing video traffic as the dominant application traffic. Both the source and MIMO-OFDM channel components exhibit non-uniform energy distribution. This motivates us to leverage the source data redundancy at the channel to achieve high video recovery performance. We propose ParCast that first separates the source and channel into independent components, matches the more important source components with higher-gain channel components, allocates power weights with joint consideration to the source and the channel, and uses analog modulation for transmission. Such a scheme achieves fine-grained unequal error protection across source components. We implemented ParCast in Matlab and on Sora. Extensive evaluation shows that our scheme outperforms competitive schemes by notable margins, sometimes up to 5~dB in PSNR for challenging scenarios.

MARVEL: multiple antenna based relative vehicle localizer
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Access to relative location of nearby vehicles on the local roads or on the freeways is useful for providing critical alerts to the drivers, thereby enhancing their driving experience as well as reducing the chances of accidents. The problem of determining the relative location of two vehicles can be broken into two smaller subproblems: (i) Relative lane localization, where a vehicle determines if the other vehicle is in left lane, same lane or right lane with respect to it, and (ii) Relative front-rear localization where it needs to be determined which of the two vehicles is ahead of the other on the road. In this paper, we propose a novel antenna diversity based solution, MARVEL, that solves the two problems of determining the relative location of two vehicles. MARVEL has two components: (i) a smartphone; and (ii) four wireless radios. Unlike exisiting technologies, MARVEL can also determine relative location of vehicles that are not in the immediate neighborhood, thereby providing the driver with more time to react. Further, due to minimal hardware requirements, the deployment cost of MARVEL is low and it can be easily installed on newer as well as existing vehicles. Using results from our real driving tests, we show that MARVEL is able to determine the relative lane location of two vehicles with 96.8% accuracy. Through trace-driven simulations, we also show that by aggregating information across different vehicles, MARVEL is able to increase the localization accuracy to 98%.

MIDU: enabling MIMO full duplex
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Given that full duplex (FD) and MIMO both employ multiple antenna resources, an important question that arises is how to make the choice between MIMO and FD? We show that optimal performance requires a combination of both to be used. Hence, we present the design and implementation of MIDU, the first MIMO full duplex system for wireless networks. MIDU employs antenna cancellation with symmetric placement of transmit and receive antennas as its primary RF cancellation technique. We show that MIDU's design provides large amounts of self-interference cancellation with several key advantages: (i) It allows for two stages of additive antenna cancellation in tandem, to yield as high as 45 dB self-interference suppression; (ii) It can potentially eliminate the need for other forms of analog cancellation, thereby avoiding the need for variable attenuator and delays; (iii) It easily scales to MIMO systems, therefore enabling the coexistence of MIMO and full duplex. We implemented MIDU on the WARP FPGA platform, and evaluated its performance against half duplex (HD)-MIMO. Our results reveal that, with the same number of RF chains, MIDU can potentially double the throughput achieved by half duplex MIMO in a single link; and provide median gains of at least 20% even in single cell scenarios, where full duplex encounters inter-client interference. Based on key insights from our results, we also highlight how to efficiently enable scheduling for a MIDU node.

Locating in fingerprint space: wireless indoor localization with little human intervention
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Indoor localization is of great importance for a range of pervasive applications, attracting many research efforts in the past decades. Most radio-based solutions require a process of site survey, in which radio signatures of an interested area are annotated with their real recorded locations. Site survey involves intensive costs on manpower and time, limiting the applicable buildings of wireless localization worldwide. In this study, we investigate novel sensors integrated in modern mobile phones and leverage user motions to construct the radio map of a floor plan, which is previously obtained only by site survey. On this basis, we design LiFS, an indoor localization system based on off-the-shelf WiFi infrastructure and mobile phones. LiFS is deployed in an office building covering over 1600m2, and its deployment is easy and rapid since little human intervention is needed. In LiFS, the calibration of fingerprints is crowdsourced and automatic. Experiment results show that LiFS achieves comparable location accuracy to previous approaches even without site survey.

Centaur: locating devices in an office environment
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
We consider the problem of locating devices such as laptops, desktops, smartphones etc. within an office environment, without requiring any special hardware or infrastructure. We consider two widely-studied approaches to indoor localization: (a) those based on Radio Frequency (RF) measurements made by devices with WiFi or cellular interfaces, and (b) those based on Acoustic Ranging (AR) measurements made by devices equipped with a speaker and a microphone. A typical office environment today comprises devices that are amenable to either one or both these approaches to localization. In this paper we ask the question, "How can we combine RF and AR based approaches in synergy to locate a wide range of devices, leveraging the benefits of both approaches?" The key contribution of this paper is Centaur, a system that fuses RF and AR based localization techniques into a single systematic framework that is based on Bayesian inference. Centaur is agnostic to the specific RF or AR technique used, giving users the flexibility of choosing their preferred RF or AR schemes. We also make two additional contributions: making AR more robust in non-line-of-sight settings (EchoBeep) and adapting AR to localize speaker-only devices (DeafBeep). We evaluate the performance of our AR enhancements and that of the Centaur framework through microbenchmarks and deployment in an office environment.

Zee: zero-effort crowdsourcing for indoor localization
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting, based onWiFi or cellular signals, has been a popular approach to indoor localization. However, its adoption in the real world has been stymied by the need for sitespecific calibration, i.e., the creation of a training data set comprising WiFi measurements at known locations in the space of interest. While efforts have been made to reduce this calibration effort using modeling, the need for measurements from known locations still remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we present Zee -- a system that makes the calibration zero-effort, by enabling training data to be crowdsourced without any explicit effort on the part of users. Zee leverages the inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, compass, gyroscope) present in the mobile devices such as smartphones carried by users, to track them as they traverse an indoor environment, while simultaneously performing WiFi scans. Zee is designed to run in the background on a device without requiring any explicit user participation. The only site-specific input that Zee depends on is a map showing the pathways (e.g., hallways) and barriers (e.g., walls). A significant challenge that Zee surmounts is to track users without any a priori, user-specific knowledge such as the user's initial location, stride-length, or phone placement. Zee employs a suite of novel techniques to infer location over time: (a) placement-independent step counting and orientation estimation, (b) augmented particle filtering to simultaneously estimate location and user-specific walk characteristics such as the stride length,(c) back propagation to go back and improve the accuracy of ocalization in the past, and (d) WiFi-based particle initialization to enable faster convergence. We present an evaluation of Zee in a large office building.

Push the limit of WiFi based localization for smartphones
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Highly accurate indoor localization of smartphones is critical to enable novel location based features for users and businesses. In this paper, we first conduct an empirical investigation of the suitability of WiFi localization for this purpose. We find that although reasonable accuracy can be achieved, significant errors (e.g., $6\sim8m$) always exist. The root cause is the existence of distinct locations with similar signatures, which is a fundamental limit of pure WiFi-based methods. Inspired by high densities of smartphones in public spaces, we propose a peer assisted localization approach to eliminate such large errors. It obtains accurate acoustic ranging estimates among peer phones, then maps their locations jointly against WiFi signature map subjecting to ranging constraints. We devise techniques for fast acoustic ranging among multiple phones and build a prototype. Experiments show that it can reduce the maximum and 80-percentile errors to as small as $2m$ and $1m$, in time no longer than the original WiFi scanning, with negligible impact on battery lifetime.

Empowering developers to estimate app energy consumption
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Battery life is a critical performance and user experience metric on mobile devices. However, it is difficult for app developers to measure the energy used by their apps, and to explore how energy use might change with conditions that vary outside of the developer's control such as network congestion, choice of mobile operator, and user settings for screen brightness. We present an energy emulation tool that allows developers to estimate the energy use for their mobile apps on their development workstation itself. The proposed techniques scale the emulated resources including the processing speed and network characteristics to match the app behavior to that on a real mobile device. We also enable exploring multiple operating conditions that the developers cannot easily reproduce in their lab. The estimation of energy relies on power models for various components, and we also add new power models for components not modeled in prior works such as AMOLED displays. We also present a prototype implementation of this tool and evaluate it through comparisons with real device energy measurements.

FLIGHT: clock calibration using fluorescent lighting

None
2012
In this paper, we propose a novel clock calibration approach called FLIGHT, which leverages the fact that the fluorescent light intensity changes with a stable period that equals half of the alternating current's. By tuning to the light emitted from indoor fluorescent lamps, FLIGHT can intelligently extract the light period information and achieve network wide time calibration by referring to such a common time reference. We address a series of practical challenges and implement FLIGHT in TelosB motes. We conduct comprehensive experiments using a 12-node test-bed in both static and mobile environments. Over one-week measurement suggests that compared with existing technologies, FLIGHT can achieve tightly synchronized time with low energy consumption.

Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Rate adaptation (RA) has been used to achieve high goodput. In this work, we explore to use RA for energy efficiency in 802.11n NICs. We show that current MIMO RA algorithms are not energy efficient for NICs despite ensuring high throughput. The fundamental problem is that, the high-throughput setting is not equivalent to the energy-efficient one. Marginal throughput gain may be realized at high energy cost. We propose EERA, an energy-based RA solution that trades off goodput for energy savings at NICs. Our experiments have confirmed its energy savings at NICs while keeping the cost at the device level and across clients acceptable.

Faster GPS via the sparse fourier transform
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
GPS is one of the most widely used wireless systems. A GPS receiver has to lock on the satellite signals to calculate its position. The process of locking on the satellites is quite costly and requires hundreds of millions of hardware multiplications, leading to high power consumption. The fastest known algorithm for this problem is based on the Fourier transform and has a complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of signal samples. This paper presents the fastest GPS locking algorithm to date. The algorithm reduces the locking complexity to O(n&#8730;(log n)). Further, if the SNR is above a threshold, the algorithm becomes linear, i.e., O(n). Our algorithm builds on recent developments in the growing area of sparse recovery. It exploits the sparse nature of the synchronization problem, where only the correct alignment between the received GPS signal and the satellite code causes their cross-correlation to spike. We further show that the theoretical gain translates into empirical gains for GPS receivers. Specifically, we built a prototype of the design using software radios and tested it on two GPS data sets collected in the US and Europe. The results show that the new algorithm reduces the median number of multiplications by 2.2x in comparison to the state of the art design, for real GPS signals.

Every bit counts: fast and scalable RFID estimation
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems have been widely deployed for various applications such as object tracking, 3D positioning, supply chain management, inventory control, and access control. This paper concerns the fundamental problem of estimating RFID tag population size, which is needed in many applications such as tag identification, warehouse monitoring, and privacy sensitive RFID systems. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for estimating tag population size called Average Run based Tag estimation (ART). The technique is based on the average run-length of ones in the bit string received using the standardized framed slotted Aloha protocol. ART is significantly faster than prior schemes because its estimator has smaller variance compared to the variances of estimators of prior schemes. For example, given a required confidence interval of 0.1% and a required reliability of 99.9%, ART is consistently 7 times faster than the fastest existing schemes (UPE and EZB) for any tag population size. Furthermore, ART's estimation time is observably independent of the tag population sizes. ART is easy to deploy because it neither requires modification to tags nor to the communication protocol between tags and readers. ART only needs to be implemented on readers as a software module. ART works with multiple readers with overlapping regions.

Temporal reachability graphs
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
While a natural fit for modeling and understanding mobile networks, time-varying graphs remain poorly understood. Indeed, many of the usual concepts of static graphs have no obvious counterpart in time-varying ones. In this paper, we introduce the notion of temporal reachability graphs. A (tau,delta)-reachability graph is a time-varying directed graph derived from an existing connectivity graph. An edge exists from one node to another in the reachability graph at time t if there exists a journey (i.e., a spatiotemporal path) in the connectivity graph from the first node to the second, leaving after t, with a positive edge traversal time tau, and arriving within a maximum delay delta. We make three contributions. First, we develop the theoretical framework around temporal reachability graphs. Second, we harness our theoretical findings to propose an algorithm for their efficient computation. Finally, we demonstrate the analytic power of the temporal reachability graph concept by applying it to synthetic and real-life datasets. On top of defining clear upper bounds on communication capabilities, reachability graphs highlight asymmetric communication opportunities and offloading potential.

A simulation tool for automated platooning in mixed highway scenarios
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Automated platooning is one of the most challenging fields in the domain of ITS. Conceptually, platooning means creating clusters of vehicles which closely follow each other autonomously without action of the driver, neither for accelerating, nor for braking. This leads to several important benefits from substantially improved road throughput to increased safety. The control of such platoons depends on two components: First, radar is typically to be used to control the distance between the vehicles, and secondly, IVC helps managing the entire platoon allowing cars to join or to leave the group whenever necessary. Platooning systems have been mostly investigated in controlled environments such as dedicated highways with centralized management. However, platooning-enabled cars will be deployed gradually and might have to travel on highways together with other non-automated vehicles. We developed a combined traffic and network simulator for studying strategies and protocols needed for managing platoons in such mixed scenarios. We show the models needed and present first results using a simple IVC-based platoon management as a proof of concept.

A unified approach to identifying and healing vulnerabilities in x86 machine code
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
The security of software systems is threatened by a wide range of attack vectors, such as buffer overflows, insecure information flow, and side channels, which can leak private information, e.g., by monitoring a program's execution time. Even if programmers manage to avoid such vulnerabilities in a program's source code or bytecode, new vulnerabilities can arise as compilers generate machine code from those representations. We propose a virtual execution environment for x86 machine code that combines information from compositional, static, and dynamic program analysis to identify vulnerabilities and timing channels, and uses code transformations to prevent those from being exploited. To achieve an appropriate level of performance as well as combine analysis results, our approach stores summary information in the form of conditional rules that can be shared among analyses.

An energy-efficient architecture for multi-hop communication between rovers and satellites in extra-terrestrial surfaces
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Over the past three decades, several man-made vehicles have being sent into space to explore the extra-terrestrial bodies. As the search for water and other useful substances in the extra-terrestrial surfaces increases, this exploration activity is set to dramatically increase over the next decade (2020); with NASA planning to explore the surface of Mars, Moon and other planets and satellites. In this regard, it is imperative to build an extremely energy-efficient communication system that will cover a large area in the range of hundreds of kilometers which unfortunately is absolutely not possible today. A two-hop communication mechanism that has been well researched in the literature is insufficient to cover the extremely large distance of extra-terrestrial surface. In this paper, a novel three-hop cluster-based hierarchical communication architecture is proposed which could be easily extended to higher number of hops. In particular, it allows the individual rovers to move large distances for collecting data and at the same time provide an extremely energy-efficient mechanism for continuously exploring the surfaces. The simulation results show that in a Martian surface, the proposed three-hop design results in a higher capacity as compared to a single-hop or a cluster-based two-hop design even when the rovers move 100 km.

Low-cost interferer detection and classification using TelosB sensor motes
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Inter-protocol interference is one of the most critical issues in wireless communication. For example, this becomes extremely problematic in environments where robustness and real-time communication need to be considered, e.g., in industrial automation or health care applications. Recently, possible approaches for interference mitigation have been described in the literature assuming that the interferer is known in advance. We contribute to this line of research with a framework for interferer detection and classification. Essentially, we use a simple IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver as for example used on the TelosB sensor motes to scan the 2.4 GHz ISM band. This band is used by different technologies including Bluetooth, WiFi, and cordless phones. The key challenge is the accurate timing of the scanning of the frequency band. The presented framework supports flexible descriptions of such scan jobs allowing to adapt to the detectors requirements, depending on the interfering protocols.

Autonomous and distributed recruitment and data collection framework for opportunistic sensing
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
People-centric sensing is a novel apporach that exploits the sensing capabilities offered by smartphones and the mobility of users to sense large scale areas without requiring the deployment of sensors in-situ. Given the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, people-centric sensing is a viable and efficient solution for crowdsourcing data. In this work, we propose a fully distributed, opportunistic sensing framework that involves two main components which both work in an ad hoc fashion: Recruitment and Data Collection. We analyzed the feasibility of our distributed approach for both components through preliminary simulations. The results show that our recruitment method is able to select 66% of the nodes that are appropriate for the sensing activity and 88% of the messages sent by these selected nodes reach the sink by using our data collection method.

Protocols for highly-dynamic airborne networks
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
End-to-end communication in highly-dynamic airborne networks is challenging due to the presence of highly mobile nodes and the inherent nature of wireless communication channels. Domain-specific protocols are required that can address these challenges and enable reliable transmission of data in this environment. We develop the ANTP (airborne network and transport protocols) suite that operates in this highly-dynamic environment while utilising cross-layer optimisations between the physical, MAC, network, and transport layers. We show how each component in the ANTP suite outperforms the traditional TCP/IP and MANET protocols through simulation using ns-3. Having verified these protocols through simulation and analysis, the next step towards deployment of the ANTP suite is developing a cross-platform implementation of the protocols. Towards this end we present an architecture for the protocol stack to be implemented in the Python programming language.

More importantly, our proposed physarum optimization algorithm can be also applied to the general Steiner tree problem.

Modelling wireless challenges

2012
A thorough understanding of the network behaviour when exposed to challenges is of paramount importance to construct a resilient MANET (mobile ad hoc network). However, modelling mobile and wireless networks as well as challenges against them is non-trivial due to dynamic and intermittent connectivity caused by channel fading and mobility of the nodes. We treat MANETs as time-varying graphs (TVGs) represented as a weighted adjacency matrix, in which the weights denote the link availability. We present how centrality-based attacks could affect network performance for different routing protocols. Furthermore, we model propagation loss models that represent realistic area-based challenges in wireless networks.

Proximity enhanced mobile D2D video streaming
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Mobile video consumption establishes as a massively growing market. To guarantee an acceptable quality of experience to the end user, current studies try to improve data transmissions on air interfaces. However, the bottleneck in cellular mobile networks is the traversal of the infrastructure. A paradigm to circumvent this fact and to increase the system's capacity is given by device-to-device communication in combination with proximity detection. Those networks promise scalability and performance improvements in utilizing scarce resources. This principle is easy to integrate into an existing mobile peer-to-peer video streaming system. In this study, we present measurements on application level to determine the performance that a smart device contributes to different wireless networks. The results outline that content uploading from smart devices is negligible in cellular networks, but shows acceptable performance in WiFi networks. This evaluation is the foundation to build a proximity enhanced video streaming system for mobile devices.

An efficient way to track peers in mobile P2P network
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
In this paper, we propose a new class of message routing scheme for a distributed network which can scale up to the needs of a very large number of mobile users. We leverage the work in the GeoKad paper which uses the Distributed Geographic Table, allowing node retrieval from resources that are close to any given region. The paper addresses the problem regarding efficient message passing and peer misses. We propose a new routing scheme that addresses this kind of limitation. In fact, the problem can be solved in two ways, either by preserving the state of peer and further use a prediction algorithm or by better message routing. The proposed scheme is based on swarm intelligence (SI) and its attribute of exploit and explore. We leverage the statistical properties of time-varying network connectivity for opportunistic message forwarding. Considering the present 3G or Wi-Fi environment this approach can also help in optimizing energy as it can prevent query over flooding which is mostly encountered in such network scenarios.

We conducted long distance radio propagation experiments at 1-10mW/145MHz, to realize a low-power long-distance communication for wildlife research and disaster prevention telemetry. In this paper, we describe that we succeeded in long distance communications, from a ferryboat to the top of Mt. Asugiyama (elevation: 501m, distance: 15km) in Kure, Hiroshima, Japan, in the verification test of our method using 3W radio power. We found out that our method has sufficient capability to achieve such a long distance communication at 10BPS/10mW in battery cell operation on a marine, if we use SSB mode and the SNR in SSB bandwidth is better than -10dB.

Vehicular networking has significant potential to enable diverse range of applications, including safety and convenience.

In the demonstration, we will introduce field tests of a multi-hop inter-vehicle communication system with distributed and autonomous TV white space channel selection, performed in Japan from January to February 2012. Furthermore, in addition to the field test videos, we will show an indoor emulation of the entire system used during the field tests in the vehicles.

On-demand content-centric wireless networking
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
Typical scenarios in the city or on campus, show a high proliferation of wireless communication devices such as smartphones, laptops or netbooks. Wireless 802.11 networks between these devices allow for a spontaneous exchange of content or provision of services without the need for infrastructure-based services. However, the above mentioned proliferation of devices and therefore large number of networks hinders users in identifying and selecting the network that serves a specific request. We propose an approach to client-driven content-centric wireless networking in which the user specifically signals his request for a user, content item or service via 802.11 management frames. Upon reception of these frames, wireless devices that serve this request establish a dedicated wireless network on-demand. Our approach seamlessly integrates into the 802.11 association process and therefore provides support for unmodified wireless devices. Furthermore, by leveraging the wireless broadcast medium, we achieve pervasive service and peer discovery without the overhead of iterating through existing networks or running a traditional service discovery protocol.

Using SOS message propagation to estimate the location of immobilized persons
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2012
This demonstration presents SOSCast, an application that will assist the search for immobilized persons in a disaster area. When a catastrophic disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami occurs, people may be immobilized because of an injury or become trapped in buildings and debris. However, in such a situation, since conventional communication services are likely to be severely damaged, it would be difficult for immobilized persons to ask for rescue using their mobile phones. As a solution, we present SOSCast, which propagates SOS messages through direct communication between smartphones most especially inside the disaster area. By collecting these SOS messages, rescuers can estimate the locations of people who need help using the application. In this demonstration, we will show our prototype implementation of the SOSCast for SOS message processing and its map function to estimate the location of immobilized persons.

Access to relative location of nearby vehicles on the local roads or on the freeways is useful for providing critical alerts to the drivers, thereby enhancing their driving experience as well as reducing the chances of accidents. The problem of determining the relative location of two vehicles can be broken into two smaller subproblems: (i) Relative lane localization, where a vehicle determines if the other vehicle is in left lane, same lane or right lane with respect to it, and (ii) Relative front-rear localization where it needs to be determined which of the two vehicles is ahead of the other on the road. In this demo, we show a novel antenna diversity based solution, MARVEL, that solves the problem of relative lane localization.

Clock calibration using fluorescent lighting
Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2012
In this demo, we propose a novel clock calibration approach called FLIGHT, which leverages the fact that the fluorescent light intensity changes with a stable period that equals half of the alternating current's. By tuning to the light emitted from indoor fluorescent lamps, FLIGHT can intelligently extract the light period information and achieve network wide time calibration by referring to such a common time reference. We address a series of practical challenges and implement FLIGHT in TelosB motes. In this demonstration, we will show that by taking advantage of the stability of the AC frequency, the detected light intensity, even from different lamps, exhibits a consistent and stable period. FLIGHT can achieve tightly synchronized time with low energy consumption. In addition, since FLIGHT is independent to the network message exchange, time synchronization can be retained even when the network is temporarily disconnected. Such characteristics particularly suit various mobility-enabled scenarios.

RF-compass: robot object manipulation using RFIDs
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Modern robots have to interact with their environment, search for objects, and move them around. Yet, for a robot to pick up an object, it needs to identify the object's orientation and locate it to within centimeter-scale accuracy. Existing systems that provide such information are either very expensive (e.g., the VICON motion capture system valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars) and/or suffer from occlusion and narrow field of view (e.g., computer vision approaches). This paper presents RF-Compass, an RFID-based system for robot navigation and object manipulation. RFIDs are low-cost and work in non-line-of-sight scenarios, allowing them to address the limitations of existing solutions. Given an RFID-tagged object, RF-Compass accurately navigates a robot equipped with RFIDs toward the object. Further, it locates the center of the object to within a few centimeters and identifies its orientation so that the robot may pick it up. RF-Compass's key innovation is an iterative algorithm formulated as a convex optimization problem. The algorithm uses the RFID signals to partition the space and keeps refining the partitions based on the robot's consecutive moves.We have implemented RF-Compass using USRP software radios and evaluated it with commercial RFIDs and a KUKA youBot robot. For the task of furniture assembly, RF-Compass can locate furniture parts to a median of 1.28 cm, and identify their orientation to a median of 3.3 degrees.

LightSync: unsynchronized visual communication over screen-camera links
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
A key challenge for smartphone based visual communication over screen-camera links is imperfect frame synchronization. The difficulty arises from frame rate diversity and variability due to camera capability, lighting conditions, and system factors. On the 4 smartphone cameras we tested, the frame rate varies between 8 and 30 frames per second. If the transmit frame rate is too high, the receiver might lose original frames or capture mixed frames, which are normally not decodable. Previous systems simply reduce the effective screen frame rate to be half the camera frame capture rate, to guarantee receiving a decodable frame every other frame. This under-utilizes the transmitter side capacity and is inefficient. We achieve frame synchronization with LightSync, which features in-frame color tracking to decode imperfect frames and a linear erasure code across frames to recover lost frames. LightSync allows smooth communication between the screen and the camera at any combination of the transmit and receive frame rates, as long as the receive rate is at least half the transmit rate. This means that each receiver can scale the decoding performance with its own camera capability. Across several phones, our system can more than double the average throughput compared to previous approaches.

This paper presents WiSee, a novel gesture recognition system that leverages wireless signals (e.g., Wi-Fi) to enable whole-home sensing and recognition of human gestures. Since wireless signals do not require line-of-sight and can traverse through walls, WiSee can enable whole-home gesture recognition using few wireless sources. Further, it achieves this goal without requiring instrumentation of the human body with sensing devices. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of WiSee using USRP-N210s and evaluate it in both an office environment and a two- bedroom apartment. Our results show that WiSee can identify and classify a set of nine gestures with an average accuracy of 94%.

Secure unlocking of mobile touch screen devices by simple gestures: you can see it but you can not do it
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
With the rich functionalities and enhanced computing capabilities available on mobile computing devices with touch screens, users not only store sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) but also use privacy sensitive applications (such as online banking) on these devices, which make them hot targets for hackers and thieves. To protect private information, such devices typically lock themselves after a few minutes of inactivity and prompt a password/PIN/pattern screen when reactivated. Passwords/PINs/patterns based schemes are inherently vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks and smudge attacks. Furthermore, passwords/PINs/patterns are inconvenient for users to enter frequently. In this paper, we propose GEAT, a gesture based user authentication scheme for the secure unlocking of touch screen devices. Unlike existing authentication schemes for touch screen devices, which use what user inputs as the authentication secret, GEAT authenticates users mainly based on how they input, using distinguishing features such as finger velocity, device acceleration, and stroke time. Even if attackers see what gesture a user performs, they cannot reproduce the behavior of the user doing gestures through shoulder surfing or smudge attacks. We implemented GEAT on Samsung Focus running Windows, collected 15009 gesture samples from 50 volunteers, and conducted real-world experiments to evaluate GEAT's performance. Experimental results show that our scheme achieves an average equal error rate of 0.5% with 3 gestures using only 25 training samples.

CorLayer: a transparent link correlation layer for energy efficient broadcast
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Wireless communication essentially occurs in a broadcast medium with concurrent receptions. Recent works [34, 41] have shown clear evidence that wireless links are not independent and that transmissions from a transmitter to multiple receivers are correlated, a phenomenon that has profound implications for the performance of network protocols such as broadcast, multi-cast, opportunistic forwarding and network coding. In this paper, we show how link correlation can significantly impact broadcast. We present the design and implementation of CorLayer, a general supporting layer for energy efficient reliable broadcast that carefully blacklists certain poorly correlated wireless links. This method uses only one-hop information, which makes it work in a fully distributed manner and introduces minimal communication overhead. The highlight of our work is CorLayer's broad applicability and effectiveness. Our system effort is indeed significant. We integrate CorLayer transparently with sixteen state-of-the-art broadcast protocols specified in thirteen publications [1, 3, 18, 19, 23, 25--27, 32, 36, 38--40] on three physical testbeds running TelosB, MICAz, and GreenOrbs nodes, respectively. The experimental results show that CorLayer remarkably improves energy efficiency across a wide spectrum of broadcast protocols and that the total number of packet transmissions can be reduced consistently by 47% on average.

Coordinating cellular background transfers using loadsense
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
To minimize battery drain due to background communication in cellular-connected devices such as smartphones, the duration for which the cellular radio is kept active should be minimized. This, in turn, calls for scheduling the background communication so as to maximize the throughput. It has been recognized in prior work that a key determinant of throughput is the wireless link quality. However, as we show here, another key factor is the load in the cell, arising from the communication of other nodes. Unlike link quality, the only way, thus far, for a cellular client to obtain a measure of load has been to perform active probing, which defeats the goal of minimizing the active duration of the radio. In this paper, we address the above dilemma by making the following contributions. First, we show experimentally that to obtain good throughput, considering link quality alone is insufficient, and that cellular load must also be factored in. Second, we present a novel technique called LoadSense for a cellular client to obtain a measure of the cellular load, locally and passively, that allows the client to determine the ideal times for communication when available throughput to the client is likely to be high. Finally, we present the Peek-n-Sneak protocol, which enables a cellular client to "peek" into the channel and "sneak" in with its background communication when the conditions are suitable. When multiple clients in a cell perform Peen-n-Sneak, it enables them to coordinate their communications, implicitly and in an entirely distributed manner, akin to CSMA in wireless LANs, helping improve throughput (and reduce energy drain) for all. Our experimental evaluation shows overall device energy savings of 20-60% even when Peek-n-Sneak is deployed incrementally.

ParkSense: a smartphone based sensing system for on-street parking
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Studies of automotive traffic have shown that on average 30% of traffic in congested urban areas is due to cruising drivers looking for parking. While we have witnessed a push towards sensing technologies to monitor real-time parking availability, instrumenting on-street parking throughout a city is a considerable investment. In this paper, we present ParkSense, a smartphone based sensing system that detects if a driver has vacated a parking spot. ParkSense leverages the ubiquitous Wi-Fi beacons in urban areas for sensing unparking events. It utilizes a robust Wi-Fi signature matching approach to detect driver's return to the parked vehicle. Moreover, it uses a novel approach based on the rate of change of Wi-Fi beacons to sense if the user has started driving. We show that the rate of change of the observed beacons is highly correlated with actual user speed and is a good indicator of whether a user is in a vehicle. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach has a significantly smaller energy footprint than traditional location sensors like GPS and Wi-Fi based positioning while still maintaining sufficient accuracy.

How voice calls affect data in operational LTE networks
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Both voice and data are indispensable services in current cellular networks. In this work, we study the inter-play of voice and data in operational LTE networks. We assess how the popular CSFB-based voice service affects the IP-based data sessions in 4G LTE networks, and visa versa. Our findings reveal that the interference between them is mutual. On one hand, voice calls may incur throughput drop, lost 4G connectivity, and application aborts for data sessions. One the other hand, users may miss incoming voice calls when turning on data access. The fundamental problem is that, signaling and control for circuit-switched voice and packet-switched data have dependency and coupling effect via the LTE phone client. We further propose fixes to the identified issues.

FluidNet: a flexible cloud-based radio access network for small cells
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Cloud-based radio access networks (C-RAN) have been proposed as a cost-efficient way of deploying small cells. Unlike conventional RANs, a C-RAN decouples the baseband processing unit (BBU) from the remote radio head (RRH), allowing for centralized operation of BBUs and scalable deployment of light-weight RRHs as small cells. In this work, we argue that the intelligent configuration of the front-haul network between the BBUs and RRHs, is essential in delivering the performance and energy benefits to the RAN and the BBU pool, respectively. We then propose FluidNet - a scalable, light-weight framework for realizing the full potential of C-RAN. FluidNet deploys a logically re-configurable front-haul to apply appropriate transmission strategies in different parts of the network and hence cater effectively to both heterogeneous user profiles and dynamic traffic load patterns. FluidNet's algorithms determine configurations that maximize the traffic demand satisfied on the RAN, while simultaneously optimizing the compute resource usage in the BBU pool. We prototype FluidNet on a 6 BBU, 6 RRH WiMAX C-RAN testbed. Prototype evaluations and large-scale simulations reveal that FluidNet's ability to re-configure its front-haul and tailor transmission strategies provides a 50% improvement in satisfying traffic demands, while reducing the compute resource usage in the BBU pool by 50% compared to baseline transmission schemes.

Last call for the buffet: economics of cellular networks
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Voice and data traffic growth over the last several years has become a major challenge for cellular operators with a direct impact on revenues, infrastructure investments, and end-user performance. The economics of these operators depend on various incentives used to attract users in the form of unlimited, buffet-like voice/sms/data packages. However, our understanding of the effects of user behavior under these offerings on operator revenues/costs remains poor. Using two years of detailed usage information of ~1 million users across three services, voice, sms and data, combined with payment and cost information, we study how user behavior affects the economics of cellular operators. We discover that around 20% of the users consume more resources than what they pay for and hence are non-profitable. In addition to the individual user behavior, we study how the user interactions in the call graph affect the operator's revenues and cost, drawing on tools from social network analysis. We develop a framework that incorporates both the individual and social user behavior for studying how volume caps influence the revenues and the traffic costs. Using this framework we empirically show that volume caps can increase the difference between the revenues and the traffic costs of the studied operator by a factor of 2, while affecting only 16% of the existing user base.

2013
First responders at the edge of the network rely on situation awareness updates to arrive in a timely matter, even when the fixed infrastructure is unavailable. The technical advancements of the commercial mobile phones make them capable of supporting such requirements under very disruptive network conditions. In this demo, we present a network architecture that exploits partial caches by utilizing network coding to deliver large files (e.g. images) to first responders. The architecture is based on a content centric network platform called ICEMAN(Information CEntric Mobile Ad-hoc Networking) and runs on Android phones. We demonstrate our system in a file dissemination scenario in a CORE/EMANE network emulation. We measure file delivery ratio, latency, and network overhead and report significant improvements that network coding achieves over fragmentation.

A lane-level cooperative collision avoidance system based on vehicular sensor networks
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
In this paper, we design and implement a lane-level cooperative collision avoidance (LCCA) system using vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The LCCA system applies vehicular sensor networks to preventing chain vehicle collisions, which allows vehicles with merely onboard sensors to prevent such collisions on the road because of sharp stops. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CCA system that does not use inaccurate GPS locations and costly roadside infrastructures to avoid chain vehicle collisions. LCCA employs inter-vehicle communications and onboard sensing to form warning groups, where each warning group is a set of vehicles that drive along the same lane and every pair of adjacent cars is within a certain distance. Only single-hop transmissions are needed to join/leave a warning group, thus keeping the group maintenance overhead low. When a sudden braking is taken in a warning group, LCCA can quickly propagate warning messages among group members. This paper demonstrates our current prototype.

This demo presents a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) service platform running on an OpenStack cloud environment. Access to this platform is secured with authentication based on 3GPP standardized Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA). The M2M network in this testbed consists of Raspberry Pi gateways and resource-constrained devices such as Arduinos. These devices have associated sensors, that report physical data such as temperature, and actuators such as LEDs, that respond to actuation commands. In this demo, the sensor data is authenticated and integrity protected end-to-end with public-key elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA). Lastly, the demo testbed includes a web-based cloud management interface referred to as the "IoT Portal". This portal allows a system administrator to specify pre-configured Virtual Machine (VM) images with custom applications. As an example, a M2M Web service is installed into the VMs. This web service collects and displays authenticated and verified sensor data and can also be used to send actuator commands.

PiCode: 2D barcode with embedded picture and ViCode: 3D barcode with embedded video
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
As 2D barcodes become more and more popular, their new applications, like mobile marketing, give a strong motivation for embedding visual information in them. Information stored on a 2D barcode, being printed on paper or shown on a display device, can be delivered to people via a camera phone with suitable decoding software. The barcoding system can be viewed as a communication system with key functional modules, including channel coding, modulation, channel estimation, demodulation and channel decoding. By applying advanced communications principles, a way to integrate a picture into a 2D barcode (called PiCode) is developed. By extending the idea, a way to integrate a video into a series of 2D barcodes, called ViCode, is also developed. To realize PiCode and ViCode, new modulation and demodulation schemes are designed. Based on our channel estimation technique, a new decoding scheme for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is devised to provide more robust error rate performance than traditional 2D barcodes. A US patent and a Chinese patent have already been filed based on the innovative methods developed for PiCode.

In this demo, we propose to use multiple inexpensive off-the-shelf radios to build the FAIR system that can be flexibly configured to realize (1) non-contiguous spectrum access (2) MIMO and beamforming (3) constructing wider-band radio. While non-contiguous spectrum access and MIMO/beamforming are naturally supported by the FAIR system, we further develop radio bonding technique for constructing wider-band radio. Radio bonding provides a cost effective alternative to proprietory radio development that it can realize a non-existing wider-band radio using multiple commodity narrower-band radios. We demonstrate FAIR and radio bonding based on Sora 2.0.

For smart traffic applications like dynamic route planning, communication between traffic participants is of high importance. Traditional approaches rely on centralized, server-based communication architectures, which raises scalability and privacy concerns.

Here, we present an interactive demonstrator of the OverDrive protocol that visualizes OverDrive's neighborhood structures and routing approach in a realistic and highly mobile traffic scenario.

v(t) CSMA: a link scheduling algorithm in wireless networks with improved delay characteristics
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Efficient scheduling of wireless resources has always been one of the most challenging tasks for wireless networks. To achieve throughput-optimality, traditional back-pressure algorithms calculate a maximal weight matching at each time slot. However, these algorithms need centralized scheduling with high complexity, and thus are not suitable for practical distributed implementations. A class of distributed queue-length-based CSMA algorithms have been proposed that achieve throughput optimality, which we refer to as regular throughput-optimal. These algorithms suffer from two problems: large delays, and temporal starvation. In this demo we demonstrate the operation of the v(t)-regulated CSMA algorithm that mitigates these two problems while provably retaining throughput optimality. The demo allows the participants to see the the performance advantage of v(t)-regulated CSMA over queue-length-based CSMA algorithms and change the different system parameters.

Mobile network performance evaluation using the radio frequency network channel emulation simulation tool(RFnest&#8482;)
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
In this demonstration, we present new capabilities of Intelligent Automation Inc. (IAI) Radio Frequency Network Emulation Simulation Tool (RFnestTM) (www.i-a-i.com/rfnest). RFnestTM is a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based network channel emulator that allows all of the channels of a full network of radio nodes to be emulated in real time, with all communication nodes experiencing a realistic channel impulse response. This allows RFnestTM to be used for protocol testing, replaying field tests, and model validation. RFnestTM has a modular design with three main capabilities: 1) FPGA based emulation hardware with RF front ends that allows nodes with real radios to send their RF signal over an emulated channel without any modification to the radio, 2) modeling of time-varying channel impulse responses within the emulation hardware, with channel properties based on mobility defined with a scripted or interactive Graphic User Interface (GUI) environment, and 3) integration with network emulators and monitoring functionality that allows the user to instantiate, manage, and monitor real and virtual network nodes within the scenario. In the new version of RFnestTM we now support: Frequency programmability: The new RFnestTM allows users to change the center frequency through software from 800 Mhz to 2.7GHz. Increased bandwidth: RFnestTM supports a bandwidth of 60 MHz. Higher fidelity channel modeling: Through software and hardware updates RFnestTM support wireless channels with up to 20 taps and a wide range of Doppler frequencies. MIMO: RFnestTM now supports different combination of MIMO channel between transmitters and receivers. We will demonstrate the capabilities of RFnestTM with scenarios, including multi-hop bulk data transfer in mixed real virtual network, bulk data transmission at 900MHz and video transfer between two real nodes.

We just released an Open Source receiver that is able to decode IEEE 802.11a/g/p Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) frames in software. This is the first Software Defined Radio (SDR) based OFDM receiver supporting channel bandwidths up to 20MHz that is not relying on additional FPGA code. Our receiver comprises all layers from the physical up to decoding the MAC packet and extracting the payload of IEEE 802.11a/g/p frames. In our demonstration, visitors can interact live with the receiver while it is decoding frames that are sent over the air. The impact of moving the antennas and changing the settings are displayed live in time and frequency domain. Furthermore, the decoded frames are fed to Wireshark where the WiFi traffic can be further investigated. It is possible to access and visualize the data in every decoding step from the raw samples, the autocorrelation used for frame detection, the subcarriers before and after equalization, up to the decoded MAC packets. The receiver is completely Open Source and represents one step towards experimental research with SDR.

ArgosV2: a flexible many-antenna research platform
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking

2013
Many-antenna base stations are a rapidly growing field in wireless research. A plethora of new theoretical techniques have been recently proposed for many-antenna base stations and networks. However, without experimental validation, it is difficult or impossible to predict the practicality and performance of these techniques in real hardware, under complex, rapidly varying, real-world conditions. Indeed, there is a significant demand for a flexible many-antenna research platform which supports rapid prototyping and validation of new massive-MIMO techniques. Leveraging our experience building Argos, a 64-antenna base station prototype, we have designed and built ArgosV2, a compact, powerful, and scalable many-antenna research platform based on WARP. In addition to the physical hardware and mechanical design, we are developing a software framework, ArgosLab, which will provide synchronization and channel estimation, greatly reducing the development effort for a wide range of massive-MIMO techniques. ArgosV2 is intended to provide ultimate scalability and programmability for experimental massive-MIMO research. The modular architecture and real-time capability of ArgosV2 can support up to 100s of base station antennas and 10s of users with streaming applications. For our demonstration, we will unveil a 96-antenna base station which supports real-time streaming applications to 32 users simultaneously.

Online evaluation of sensing characteristics for radio platforms in the CREW federated testbed
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking

2013
Cognitive radio systems have gathered a lot of research interest during the last decade. Accuracy of spectrum sensing and efficiency of free spectrum utilization are considered as the primary objectives in this emerging technology, which promises a boost in wireless network performance, through exploitation of underutilized licensed frequency bands. As the focus of researchers is usually on these two major challenges, other aspects have been in part underestimated. In this work, we consider two factors that are rather important for evaluation of cognitive platforms, namely sensing delay and energy efficiency. The first is related to the latency induced by the spectrum sensing process and its impact on sensing efficiency, which is tightly connected to both the QoS performance of secondary users and the protection of primary users. On the other hand, energy consumption is considered as a crucial issue in all types of wireless communications, due to restricted battery autonomy of mobile devices, as well as for moving towards "greener" solutions in telecommunications. Therefore, it is important to extend existing testbed experimentation tools and develop new ones, in order to equip cognitive testbeds with such advanced monitoring capabilities. In this work, we present a monitoring procedure that has been directly integrated in the experimentation tools of the CREW testbed federation and demonstrate how it aids in the online evaluation of four different cognitive platforms in terms of the aforementioned metrics.

With the spread of mobile devices, there is a growing demand for direct communication between users. However, under recent complex IP networks, it is extremely hard to establish a direct connection between devices. In order to solve the problem, authors have been proposing a new end-to-end communication architecture called "Network Traversal with Mobility" (NTMobile). In NTMobile, applications in the mobile device establish an end-to-end connection by using virtual IPv4/IPv6 addresses in the NTMobile network independent from real IP networks. In this demo, we will show that Android smartphones can make free communication with each other without any constraint such as an NAT traversal problem in IPv4 networks and incompatibility between IPv4 and IPv6 architectures.

BEEINFO: data forwarding based on interest and swarm intelligence for socially-aware networking
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Socially-aware networking provides a promising paradigm for data forwarding by exploiting the involved nodes' social properties in mobile social networks. However, individuals' learning capability and awareness to the dynamic environment have not been well explored in the literature. In this paper, we give a brief introduction of an interest-based scheme called BEEINFO. Inspired by swarm intelligence, BEEINFO takes advantage of individuals' perceiving and learning capability to gather information of density and social tie during communication. Moreover, it classifies communities based on nodes' interests and distinguishes data forwarding into situations of inter-community and intra-community. Furthermore, BEEINFO performs efficient message scheduling and buffer management to improve performance. The simulation results show that BEEINFO outperforms PROPHET and Epidemic in message delivery ratio, overhead and hop count, except for average latency.

CRESCENT: a modular cost-efficient open-access testbed for cognitive radio networks routing protocols
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) provide a solution to increase the utilization of the scarce radio frequency spectrum. Building testbeds for CRNs is one of the main challenges that can affect the wide deployability of such networks. Many testbeds were proposed for testing CRN routing protocols, but most of them are either pure simulations or require high deployment cost for buying and maintaining the needed hardware devices on a large scale. We propose CRESCENT: a modular framework for testing CRNs routing protocols with cost-efficient and large-scale deployability. CRESCENT is based on general purpose computers without the need for any special devices leveraging their built-in Wi-Fi interfaces as the default interface. The framework is built on top of Click modular router to ensure the ease of the development of new routing protocols while providing new modules that are essential for cognitive radio protocols.

In this article we illustrate that, management of network resources can yield notably different performances leading to different restoration behaviors -- for different network topologies. In consideration towards this, we first briefly summarize our earlier work on a novel fault restoration mechanism. The proposed mechanism addresses the problem of finding the minimum bandwidth cooperative route in the backhaul of mobile network operators that is shared among multiple operators. We then present our recent results on the extended performance evaluations of the same, for four different synthetic network topologies carried out using extensive simulations. Through these evaluations, we conclude on the best topology that mobile network operators should construct in order for them to maximally benefit by the proposed cooperative routing scheme to yield optimum performance for their capital expenditure.

SilentSense: silent user identification via touch and movement behavioral biometrics
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
In this work, we present SilentSense, a framework to authenticate users silently and transparently by exploiting the user touch behavior biometrics and leveraging the integrated sensors to capture the micro-movement of the device caused by user's screen-touch actions. By tracking the fine-detailed touch actions of the user, we build a "touch-based biometrics" model of the owner by extracting some principle features, and then verify whether the current user is the owner or guest/attacker. When using the smartphone, the unique operating pattern of the user is detected and learnt by collecting the sensor data and touch events silently. When users are mobile, the micro-movement of mobile devices caused by touch is suppressed by that due to the large scale user-movement which will render the touch-based biometrics ineffective. To address this, we integrate a movement-based biometrics for each user with previous touch-based biometrics. We conduct extensive evaluations of our approaches on the Android smartphone, we show that the user identification accuracy is over 99%.

Opportunistic sensing is a novel approach that exploits the sensing capabilities offered by smartphones and users' mobility to sense large scale areas without requiring the deployment of sensors in-situ.

We evaluate our approach by considering alternative implementations of the framework, and by measuring their performance via extensive trace-based simulations. Our results show how the performances of the considered protocols vary, depending on the particular scenario, and suggest guidelines for future development of distributed opportunistic sensing systems.

We present SmartLoc, a localization system to estimate the location and the traveling distance by leveraging the lower-power inertial sensors embedded in smartphones as a supplementary to GPS. To minimize the negative impact of sensor noises, SmartLoc exploits the intermittent strong GPS signals and uses the linear regression to build a prediction model which is based on the trace estimated from inertial sensors and the one computed from the GPS. Furthermore, we utilize landmarks (e.g., bridge, traffic lights) detected automatically and special driving patterns (e.g., turning, uphill, and downhill) from inertial sensory data to improve the localization accuracy when the GPS signal is weak. Our evaluations of SmartLoc in the city demonstrates its technique viability and significant localization accuracy improvement compared with GPS and other approaches: the error is approximately 20m for 90% of time while the known mean error of GPS is 42.22m.

SpyLoc: a light weight localization system for smartphones
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
In this paper, we propose and addresses the challenge of designing a light-weight high-accuracy indoor/outdoor localization system (SpyLoc) for off-the-shelf smartphones. In SpyLoc, we want to leverages both the acoustic interface (microphone/speaker) and the Wi-Fi interface at the kernel-level of the smartphones as well as the inertial sensors in the smartphones to achieve high localization accuracy. In the ranging-based approach, we utilizes the RF-Beep ranging scheme[?], and in dead reckoning-based approach, we fuses the inertial sensors of the smartphone to estimate the direction and the distance of user's movements. In RF-Beep [?], we develope a ranging scheme that utilizes the Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) between the acoustic and the radio-frequency (RF) signal. The RF-Beep basically leverages the slow propagation speed of the acoustic signal with respect to the RF signal to estimate the relative range. The well known acoustic range based localization scheme, Cricket [?] also utilizes the same concept of using the difference in arrival times of concurrent transmissions of radio and ultrasound signals at the target device to infer the distance. Unlike the Cricket, which was designed with special hardware, our localization scheme is applicable to the smartphones. In RF-Beep, we address the different challenges of implementing such ranging scheme in smartphones by leveraging the existing functionalities of the audio driver and the WiFi driver. Further details on RF-Beep scheme could be found in~\cite{Uddin:RF}. The ranging based localization scheme typically requires at least three reference points (e.g., anchor points), in order to calculate the location. However all these three reference points must be in Line of Sight(LoS) to the target device. In \textit{SpyLoc} localization system, we use the combination of both ranging-based and dead reckoning approaches to reduce the constraint of having three LoS anchor/reference points all the time. The basic idea of the SpyLoc is to leverage the benefits of both the dead-reckoning and the ranging scheme to build a practical localization system. Given the high errors of the inertial sensors, SpyLoc uses a novel ranging scheme based on both the acoustic and WiFi interfaces to mitigate this error in order to improve the localization accuracy. Unlike the ranging-based or RF-based localization schemes that require multiple reference points (e.g., achor points), using the dead reckoning in SpyLoc reduces the required number of reference points to only one reference to locate and track users accurately. This low dependency on ranging scheme make SpyLoc practically applicable to high mobility environment. Finally, In the SpyLoc system, user's device (i.e. smartphone) works autonomously to determine its location. This system does not require any coordination from the nearby smartphones or from a central controller. Furthermore, this localization system does not require user's device to transmit any acoustic signal or RF messages to nearby smartphones. Therefore increasing the number of user's devices have no impact on the complexity of the SpyLoc system, which make SpyLoc a light-weight localization system. In addition, such characteristics make the localization system privacy preserving and energy efficient for the user's smartphone.

2013
This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of Concurrent-MAC, a MAC protocol for increasing concurrent transmissions in multi-AP wireless LANs. Based on SINR values between stations and APs, sets of concurrent transmitters are identified by the backhaul of APs. A station gaining access to the channel, schedules a set of its neighbors for concurrent transmissions. Neighbors chosen for concurrent transmission can start transmitting on the channel, immediately after they overhear the privilege given to them for concurrent transmission. Our simulation results show that, in dense wireless LANs, Concurrent-MAC can improve aggregate throughput significantly compared to 802.11 DCF.

Measuring human queues using WiFi signals
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
We investigate using smartphone WiFi signals to track human queues, which are common in many business areas such as retail stores, airports, and theme parks. Real-time monitoring of such queues would enable a wealth of new applications, such as bottleneck analysis, shift assignments, and dynamic workflow scheduling. We take a minimum infrastructure approach and thus utilize a single monitor placed close to the service area along with transmitting phones. Our strategy extracts unique features embedded in the signal traces to infer the critical time points when a person reaches the head of the queue and finishes service, and from these inferences we derive a person's waiting and service times. We develop a feature driven approach in our system. Extensive experiments conducted both in the laboratory demonstrate that our system is robust to queues with different waiting time. We show that in spite of noisy signal readings, our methods can measure important time periods in queue (e.g., service and waiting times) to within a $10$ second resolution.

T-Mobile QoE lab: making mobile browsing faster and open research problems
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
T-Mobile USA is looking at all possible ways to optimize the quality of user experience (QoE) for our customers in while balanceing with our network resources and device energy consumptions needs. In the mobile smart phone world, users often have a the misperception that people often held about use experience is the faster the network speed is and, the faster the phone CPU speed is;, the better the quality of experience (QoE) will beis. On the contrary, we intend to use three practical examples to unveil the mystery behind the mobile network black box and illustrate it is actually the end-to-tend (E2E) latency which impacts the QoE of one of the most commonly used data services -- mobile browsing. A lengthy E2E latency due to rarely-understood and hard-to-uncovered phone or network issues may render a very poor browsing page loading speed time even if you have a super hero dual core smart phone with the fastest 4G network speed. In order to understand the E2E latency better in the transient wireless channel conditions and optimize data QoE in a much fastermore expedient way, we advocate the use of the cCross-device/network evaluation methodology. Finally, we presented a few research questions that we are facing and to solicit the research community's input.

Radio environment mapping with mobile devices in the TV white space
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
In this paper, we envision a scenario where mobile devices perform at least part-time spectrum sensing in a collaborative fashion under the control of a central server. The goal is to create an adequate `radio environment map' for the `white spaces' that will be useful for spectrum management decisions. We lay out the research challenges, describe a prototype implementation using a DTV receiver dongle interfaced with an Android-based mobile device, and present preliminary performance measurements.

V-scope: an opportunistic wardriving approach to augmenting TV whitespace databases
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
The recently released TV whitespaces offer a promising land for wireless communications. The secondary users of TV whitespaces today rely on spectrum occupancy databases to determine vacant TV channels for unlicensed communications. However, the accuracy of these databases (that depend solely on propagation models as per guidelines of the FCC) may be low. In this paper, we propose V-Scope - a vehicular sensing framework aimed to collect wide-area spectrum measurements for evaluating the accuracy of these databases. A key design feature of V-Scope is to leverage spectrum sensors mounted on public vehicles for collecting and reporting measurements from the road (opportunistic wardriving). We have currently deployed a version of our system on a single public transit bus traveling across a mid-sized city in the US. Based on measurements collected at over 1 million locations across a 100 square-km area, we find that databases tend to over-predict the coverage of certain TV broadcasts, unnecessarily blocking the usage of whitespace spectrum in a large area (up to 42% measured locations). We further propose ways of leveraging these measurements to enhance existing propagation models in databases.

Exploring indoor white spaces in metropolises
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
It is a promising vision to utilize white spaces, i.e., vacant VHF and UHF TV channels, to satisfy skyrocketing wireless data demand in both outdoor and indoor scenarios. While most prior works have focused on exploring outdoor white spaces, the indoor story is largely open for investigation. Motivated by this observation and that 70% of the spectrum demand comes from indoor environments, we carry out a comprehensive study of exploring indoor white spaces. We first present a large-scale measurement of outdoor and indoor TV spectrum occupancy in 30+ diverse locations in a typical metropolis Hong Kong. Our measurement results confirm abundant white spaces available for exploration in a wide range of areas in metropolises. In particular, more than 50% and 70% of the TV spectrum are white spaces in outdoor and indoor scenarios, respectively. While there are substantially more white spaces in indoor scenarios than in outdoor scenarios, there is no effective solution for identifying indoor white spaces. To fill in this gap, we propose the first system WISER (for White-space Indoor Spectrum EnhanceR), to identify and track indoor white spaces in a building, without requiring user devices to sense the spectrum. We discuss the design space of such system and justify our design choices using intensive real-world measurements. We design the architecture and algorithms to address the inherent challenges. We build a WISER prototype and carry out real-world experiments to evaluate its performance. Our results show that WISER can identify 30%-50% more indoor white spaces with negligible false alarms, as compared to alternative baseline approaches.

CSpy: finding the best quality channel without probing
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Wireless performance depends directly on the quality of the channel. A wireless transmitter can improve its performance by estimating and transmitting on only the strongest channel, which can be of significantly higher quality than a weak channel (yielding up to 100% rate improvement). It is considered impossible to predict the quality of the unseen channels. Thus, the only way to identify the strongest channel is by probing each channel individually, incurring large over- heads. The key contribution of this paper is a discovery of previously unobserved properties of the wireless channel that makes it possible to predict the the strongest of a set of channels from the measurements collected only on a single channel. We confirm the properties through measurements and present a theoretical analysis that explains their nature. Our proposed system, CSpy, utilizes these observations to predict the strongest channel. CSpy is the first to reliably estimate the strongest channel by utilizing channel responses extracted from off-the-shelf wireless chipsets, without probing any additional channels. By tracking the strongest channel, CSpy improves performance by up to 100% in comparison to channel agnostic schemes.

Interference alignment by motion
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in interference alignment which has been demonstrated to deliver gains for wireless networks both analytically and empirically. Typically, interference alignment is achieved by having a MIMO sender precode its transmission to align it at the receiver. In this paper, we show, for the first time, that interference alignment can be achieved via motion, and works even for single-antenna transmitters. Specifically, this alignment can be achieved purely by sliding the receiver's antenna. Interestingly, the amount of antenna displacement is of the order of one inch which makes it practical to incorporate into recent sliding antennas available on the market. We implemented our design on USRPs and demonstrated that it can deliver 1.98&#215; throughput gains over 802.11n in networks with both single-antenna and multi- antenna nodes.

Understanding RFID counting protocols
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Counting the number of RFID tags, or RFID counting, is needed by a wide array of important wireless applications. Motivated by its paramount practical importance, researchers have developed an impressive arsenal of techniques to improve the performance of RFID counting (i.e., to reduce the time needed to do the counting). This paper aims to gain deeper and fundamental insights in this subject to facilitate future research on this topic. As our central thesis, we find out that the overlooked key design aspect for RFID counting protocols to achieve near-optimal performance is a conceptual separation of a protocol into two phases. The first phase uses small overhead to obtain a rough estimate, and the second phase uses the rough estimate to further achieve an accuracy target. Our thesis also indicates that other performance-enhancing techniques or ideas proposed in the literature are only of secondary importance. Guided by our central thesis, we manage to design near-optimal protocols that are more efficient than existing ones and simultaneously simpler than most of them.

Optimal throughput and delay in delay-tolerant networks with ballistic mobility
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
This work studies delay and throughput achievable in delay-tolerant networks with ballistic mobility -- informally, when the average distance a node travels before changing direction does not become vanishingly small as the number of nodes in the deployment area grows. Ballistic mobility is a simple condition satisfied by a large number of well-studied mobility models, including the i.i.d. model, the random waypoint model, the uniform mobility model and Levy walks with exponent less than 1. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show that, under some very mild and natural hypotheses satisfied by all models in the literature, ballistic mobility is strictly necessary to achieve simultaneously, as the number of nodes grows, a) per-node throughput that does not become vanishingly small and b) communication delay that does not become infinitely large. Any network whose nodes exhibit a more "local" mobility pattern (e.g. Levy walks with exponent greater than 1, or Brownian motion) must sacrifice either a) or b), regardless of the communication scheme adopted -- even with network coding. Second, we present a novel packet routing scheme. Our scheme is relatively simple and does not rely on centralized control, replication, or static base stations. At the same time it achieves both non-vanishing throughput and bounded delay as the number of nodes grows, on any network with ballistic mobility (i.e. whenever they can be simultaneously achieved), asymptotically outperforming any existing communication scheme that exploits node mobility to boost throughput.

Exploring the potential in practice for opportunistic networks amongst smart mobile devices
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Wireless network providers are under tremendous pressure to deliver unprecedented amounts of data to a variety of mobile devices. A powerful concept that has only gained limited traction in practice has been the concept of opportunistic networks whereby nodes opportunistically communicate with each other when in range to augment or overcome existing wireless systems. One of the key impediments towards the adoption of opportunistic communications has been the inability to demonstrate viability at scale, namely showing that sufficient opportunities exist and more importantly exist when needed to offer significant network performance gains. We demonstrate through a large-scale, longitudinal study of smartphone users that significant opportunities are indeed prevalent, are indeed stable, and end up being reasonably reciprocal both on short and long-term timescales. In this paper, we propose a framework dubbed PSR (Prevalence, Stability, Reciprocity) to capture key aspects that characterize the net potential for opportunistic networks which we feel merit significantly increased attention.

Fine-grained spectrum adaptation in WiFi networks
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Explosive growth of WiFi traffic calls for new technologies to dramatically improve spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we propose an approach to adapt the spectrum on a per-frame basis. It consists of three major components: (i) a fine-grained spectrum access design that allows a sender and receiver to change their transmission and reception spectrum on demand, (ii) fast and accurate spectrum detection that allows a receiver to determine which spectrum is used by its sender on a per-frame basis by exploiting the IEEE 802.11 preamble structure, and (iii) an efficient spectrum allocation algorithm that determines which spectrum to use for each transmission by taking into account frequency diversity and interference. It can further be adapted to perform a joint assignment of spectrum, schedule, and access point (AP) for each frame. Using a SORA implementation and trace-driven simulation, we demonstrate the feasibility of per-frame spectrum adaptation and its significant benefit over existing channel assignment approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first per-frame spectrum adaptation prototype for WiFi networks.

Observing home wireless experience through WiFi APs
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
We present a measurement study of wireless experience in a diverse set of home environments by deploying an infrastructure, we call WiSe. Our infrastructure consists of OpenWrt-based Access Points (APs) that have been given away to residents for free to be installed as their primary wireless access mechanism. These APs are configured with our specialized measurement and monitoring software that communicates with our measurement controller through an open API. We have collected wireless performance traces from 30 homes for a period in excess of 6 months. To analyze the characteristics of these home wireless environments, we have also developed a simple metric that estimates the likely TCP throughput different clients can expect based on current channel and environmental conditions. With this infrastructure, we provide multiple quantitative observations, some of which are anecdotally understood in our community. For example, while a majority of links performed well most of the time, we observed cases of poor client experience about 2.1% of the total time.

Symphony: cooperative packet recovery over the wired backbone in enterprise WLANs
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
In this paper, we propose Symphony, a packet recovery architecture that encourages collisions among transmitters, and utilizes the unused capacity in the backbone to transmit recovered data packets and coordinate the efficient recovery of collided packets. Symphony improves the wireless throughput while incurring a low overhead on the typically under-utilized wired backbone. In Symphony, upon receiving the collided transmissions, the APs carefully suppress a subset of the transmissions. Realizing this idea in practice entails several challenges including identification of clients that have data to transmit and ensuring that the algorithm works despite imperfect time-synchronization and non-zero latency among APs. We present Symphony that addresses these challenges and show how it leverages Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to further increase the network throughput. Experiments performed on an USRP testbed shows that on an average, Symphony provides 43% and 187% higher throughput over Omniscient TDMA and IEEE 802.11, respectively. ns-3 based simulation results show that on an average, Symphony provides a throughput of up to 1.63x compared to omniscient TDMA and 5.6x compared to IEEE 802.11.

Power and thermal challenges in mobile devices
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
In spite of significant advances in the development of low-power designs and power management techniques, power remains and will remain a first-class design constraint for mobile devices. The functionality integrated into mobile devices will only continue to grow with the increasing transition from PCs to super-phones. Power remains one of the critical hurdles to this transition, and without continued innovations in power management, the term "mobile" devices will be rendered moot. In addition to (and closely related to) power challenges in mobile devices are thermal challenges. Increasingly complex and rich functionality in mobile devices leads to higher power dissipation, and consequently, higher temperatures. However, thermal constraints are constant across successive device generations. Thermal limits, even more than power, will become the fundamental bottleneck to increasing the capabilities of such devices, making thermal management techniques crucial. This paper discusses some of the major challenges in power management and thermal management for current and next-generation mobile devices from a semiconductor industry perspective. Specifically, this paper discusses challenges in three areas: process-variability-aware power management, thermally aware power management and thermal management for mobile devices. Broadcom mobile chipsets feature multiple such advanced power and thermal management techniques, with active on-going research and development in each of these areas.

Towards a virtual cellular network with variable grade spectrum: challenges and opportunities
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
In this paper, we make a case for future wireless networks that will seamlessly exploit many variable grade spectrum bands. The transformation we envision will be fueled by a fundamental change in the way networks use spectrum. The mix of spectrum options will include existing exclusively licensed and unlicensed bands and new shared spectrum bands where incumbent primary transmitters with interruptible, exclusive access share the band with cooperating (secondary) users. Such bands used in small cell deployments will be key to creating enormous wireless capacity needed to support future traffic demands. The nascent spectrum database technologies will morph into more dynamic spectrum databases and provide essential interference coordination, channel management and monetization. This trend when combined with infrastructure sharing enabled by cloud and SDN technologies will gradually lead to new deployment models. Such network transformation and democratization of spectrum access can fuel innovative business models and new regulatory regimes for wireless networks. We illustrate the new architecture and component radio, database and security technologies using concrete example of incorporating shared spectrum in a small cell network.

Indoor localization: ready for primetime?
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking

2013
Indoor navigation and location tracking have been popular academic research topics in our community for more than a decade. This has lead to a vast amount of theoretical results, positioning techniques, and system prototypes that were developed in academia and industry research labs for efficient and accurate indoor localization and navigation. Marketplace adoption, however, has been slow -- products have largely focused on outdoor positioning and navigation. Only recently has the industry buzz and investment in indoor positioning and navigation products picked up. This panel will discuss whether indoor positioning solutions are finally ready for the marketplace. It will examine the limitations of the state of the art along dimensions such as precision, accuracy, energy consumption, complexity, and privacy and will debate in which areas, if any, further academic research is called for. The panelists will also discuss why adoption has been slow, whether any significant non-technical hurdles remain, and speculate which technical solutions are most likely to succeed.

Indexing the real world: sensing, big data and mobility

2013
In this presentation, Dr. Henry Tirri, EVP & CTO of Nokia and UC Berkeley will discuss insights into the social and scientific implications of the technology trends being driven by the rise of large scale multi-device cloud-based computing. The cloud has already fundamentally transformed everyday experiences visible to consumers through their access to streaming media, social networking and location services via multiple different computing devices, from phones and tablets to connected accessories. As bits continue to eat atoms, more elements of the physical world will turn first into code and then into code that lives in the cloud. This is driven by the enormous advantages in sharing, indexing and elasticity of computing code has with respect to physical objects. We have seen this happening to photos and videos, music and books, but this is only the beginning. Consumers will increasingly turn to connected experiences that will in turn produce a wealth of data at a at rate unprecedented in the history of mankind. Due to the pervasiveness of this change, the next phase of the cloud era will see increased partnerships between public and private sectors around long-term technology trends in areas ranging from urban planning to health care. It can be anticipated that connected hardware will continue to diversify, with an increased emphasis on "multi-sensing". Wearables, sensor clusters in vehicles and smart devices, and independent sensors will all become first class citizens of the cloud: both feeding data into it and drawing it back out again. We will look at one exciting example of this trend -- indexing of the real world made possible by global scale location services. We argue that ultimately computing will totally de-centralize and live throughout a heterogeneous cloud-based architecture, but energy will continue to be the "One Ring to Rule Them All," that will define where in the cloud the execution happens.

SafeSlinger: easy-to-use and secure public-key exchange
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking

2013
Users regularly experience a crisis of confidence on the Internet. Is that email or instant message truly originating from the claimed individual? Such doubts are commonly resolved through a leap of faith, expressing the desperation and helplessness of users. To establish a secure basis for online communication, we propose SafeSlinger, a system leveraging the proliferation of smartphones to enable people to securely and privately exchange their public keys. Through the exchanged authentic public keys, SafeSlinger establishes a secure channel offering secrecy and authenticity, which we use to support secure messaging and file exchange. SafeSlinger also provides an API for importing applications' public keys into a user's contact information. By slinging entire contact entries to others, we propose secure introductions, as the contact entry includes the SafeSlinger public keys as well as other public keys that were imported. We present the design and implementation of SafeSlinger for Android and iOS, which is available from the respective app stores. An overview video of SafeSlinger is available at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFXL8fUqNKY

Creating secrets out of erasures
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Current security systems often rely on the adversary's computational limitations. Wireless networks offer the opportunity for a different, complementary kind of security, which relies on the adversary's limited network presence (i.e., that the adversary cannot be located at many different points in the network at the same time). We present a system that leverages this opportunity to enable n wireless nodes to create a shared secret S, in a way that an eavesdropper, Eve, obtains very little information on S. Our system consists of two steps: (1) The nodes transmit packets following a special pattern, such that Eve learns very little about a given fraction of the transmitted packets. This is achieved through a combination of beam forming (from many different sources) and wiretap codes. (2) The nodes participate in a protocol that reshuffles the information known to each node, such that the nodes end up sharing a secret that Eve knows very little about. Our protocol is easily implementable in existing wireless devices and scales well with the number of nodes; these properties are achieved through a combination of public feedback, broadcasting, and network coding. We evaluate our system through a 5-node testbed. We demonstrate that a group of wireless nodes can generate thousands of new shared secret bits per second, with their secrecy being independent of the adversary's computational capabilities.

SecureArray: improving wifi security with fine-grained physical-layer information
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Despite the important role that WiFi networks play in home and enterprise networks they are relatively weak from a security standpoint. With easily available directional antennas, attackers can be physically located off-site, yet compromise WiFi security protocols such as WEP, WPA, and even to some extent WPA2 through a range of exploits specific to those protocols, or simply by running dictionary and human-factors attacks on users' poorly-chosen passwords. This presents a security risk to the entire home or enterprise network. To mitigate this ongoing problem, we propose SecureArray, a system designed to operate alongside existing wireless security protocols, adding defense in depth against active attacks. SecureArray's novel signal processing techniques leverage multi-antenna access point (AP) to profile the directions at which a client's signals arrive, using this angle-of-arrival (AoA) information to construct highly sensitive signatures that with very high probability uniquely identify each client. Upon overhearing a suspicious transmission, the client and AP initiate an AoA signature-based challenge-response protocol to confirm and mitigate the threat. We also discuss how SecureArray can mitigate direct denial-of-service attacks on the latest 802.11 wireless security protocol. We have implemented SecureArray with an eight-antenna WARP hardware radio acting as the AP. Our experimental results show that in a busy office environment, SecureArray is orders of magnitude more accurate than current techniques, mitigating 100% of WiFi spoofing attack attempts while at the same time triggering false alarms on just 0.6% of legitimate traffic. Detection rate remains high when the attacker is located only five centimeters away from the legitimate client, for AP with fewer numbers of antennas and when client is mobile.

NEMOx: scalable network MIMO for wireless networks
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Network MIMO (netMIMO) has potential for significantly enhancing the capacity of wireless networks with tight coordination of access points (APs) to serve multiple users concurrently. Existing schemes realize netMIMO by integrating distributed APs into one ``giant'' MIMO but do not scale well owing to their global synchronization requirement and overhead in sharing data between APs. To remedy this limitation, we propose a novel system, NEMOx, that realizes netMIMO downlink transmission for large-scale wireless networks. NEMOx organizes a network into practical-size clusters, each containing multiple distributed APs (dAPs) that opportunistically synchronize with each other for netMIMO downlink transmission. Inter-cluster interference is managed with a decentralized channel-access algorithm, which is designed to balance between the dAPs' cooperation gain and spatial reuse---a unique tradeoff in netMIMO. Within each cluster, NEMOx optimizes the power budgeting among dAPs and the set of users to serve, ensuring fairness and effective cancellation of cross-talk interference. We have implemented and evaluated a prototype of NEMOx in a software radio testbed, demonstrating its throughput scalability and multiple folds of performance gain over current wireless LAN architecture and alternative netMIMO schemes.

ZIMO: building cross-technology MIMO to harmonize zigbee smog with WiFi flash without intervention
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Recent studies show that WiFi interference has been a major problem for low power urban sensing technology ZigBee networks. Existing approaches for dealing with such interferences often modify either the ZigBee nodes or WiFi nodes. However, massive deployment of ZigBee nodes and uncooperative WiFi users call for innovative cross-technology coexistence without intervening legacy systems. In this work we investigate the WiFi and ZigBee coexistence when ZigBee is the interested signal.Mitigating short duration WiFi interference (called flash) in long duration ZigBee data (called smog) is challenging, especially when we cannot modify the WiFi APs and the massively deployed sensor nodes. To address these challenges, we propose ZIMO, a sink-based MIMO design for harmony coexistence of ZigBee and WiFi networks with the goal of protecting the ZigBee data packets.The key insight of ZIMO is to properly exploit opportunities resulted from differences between WiFi and ZigBee, and bridge the gap between interested data and cross technology signals. Also, extracting the channel coefficient of WiFi and ZigBee will enhance other coexistence technologies such as TIMO [1]. We implement a prototype for ZIMO in GNURadio-USRP N200, and our extensive evaluations under real wireless conditions show that ZIMO can improve up to 1.9x throughput for ZigBee network, with median gain of 1.5x, and 1.1x to 1.9x for WiFi network as byproduct in ZigBee signal recovery.

Adaptive feedback compression for MIMO networks
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
MIMO beamforming technology can scale wireless data rate proportionally with the number of antennas. However, the overhead induced by receivers' CSI (channel state information) feedback scales at a higher rate. In this paper, we address this fundamental tradeoff with Adaptive Feedback Compression (AFC). AFC quantizes or compresses CSI from 3 dimensions --- time, frequency and numerical values, and adapts the intensity of compression according to channel profile. This simple principle faces many practical challenges, e.g., a huge search space for adaption, estimation or prediction of the impact of compression on network throughput, and the coupling of different users in multi-user MIMO networks. AFC meets these challenges using a novel cross-layer adaptation metric, a metric extracted from 802.11 packet preambles, and uses it to guide the selection of compression intensity, so as to balance the tradeoff between overhead reduction and capacity loss (due to compression). We have implemented AFC on a software radio testbed. Our experiments show that AFC can outperform alternative approaches in a variety of radio environments.

Using crowd-sourced viewing statistics to save energy in wireless video streaming
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Video streaming on smartphones is one of the most popular but also most energy hungry services today. Using mobile video services results in two contradictory sources of energy waste for smartphones: i) energy waste because of excessively aggressive prefetching of content that the user will not watch because of abandoning the session, and ii) excessive amount of tail energy, which is energy wasted by keeping the wireless interface powered on after receiving a chunk of content; this is caused by prefetching chunks that are too small. To remedy this, we propose a novel download scheduling algorithm based on crowd-sourced video viewing statistics. Our algorithm judiciously evaluates the probability of a user interrupting a video viewing in order to perform the right amount of prefetching. In this way, the algorithm balances the amount of the two above-mentioned kinds of energy waste. By simulations, we show that our scheduler cuts the energy waste to half compared to existing download strategies. We have also developed an Android prototype that implements the download scheduler together with a novel downloader that speeds up the download by exploiting the Fast Start technique. The prototype exhibits the desired properties of the scheduler, and its faster downloading mechanism yields further energy savings of up to 80% compared to the default Android YouTube app.

A scheduling framework for adaptive video delivery over cellular networks
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
As the growth of mobile video traffic outpaces that of cellular network speed, industry is adopting HTTP-based adaptive video streaming technology which enables dynamic adaptation of video bit-rates to match changing network conditions. However, recent measurement studies have observed problems in fairness, stability, and efficiency of resource utilization when multiple adaptive video flows compete for bandwidth on a shared wired link. Through experiments and simulations, we confirm that such undesirable behavior manifests itself in cellular networks as well. To overcome these problems, we design an in-network resource management framework, AVIS, that schedules HTTP-based adaptive video flows on cellular networks. AVIS effectively manages the resources of a cellular base station across adaptive video flows. AVIS also provides a framework for mobile operators to achieve a desired balance between optimal resource allocation and user quality of experience. AVIS has three key differentiating features: (1) It optimally computes the bit-rate allocation for each user, (2) It includes a scheduler and per-flow shapers to enforce bit-rate stability of each flow and (3) It leverages the resource virtualization technique to separate resource management of adaptive video flows from regular video flows. We implement a prototype system of AVIS and evaluate it on both a WiMAX network testbed and a LTE system simulator to show its efficacy and scalability.

An information-aware QoE-centric mobile video cache
Proceedings of the 19th annual international conference on Mobile computing & networking
None
2013
Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in the volume of video traffic in mobile settings. In this paper, we present the design of a mobile video-centric proxy cache, named iProxy, that offers improved performance in terms of both hit rates and streaming quality. Our thesis in designing iProxy is that we need to elevate the traditional view of caching from "data" to "information" in order to optimally meet the stringent requirements of video streaming in mobile settings. iProxy relies on recent advances on information-bound references (IBRs) to collapse multiple related cache entries into a single one, improving hitrate while lowering storage costs. iProxy incorporates a novel dynamic linear rate adaptation scheme to ensure high stream quality in face of channel diversity and device heterogeneity. Our evaluation of iProxy using realistic traffic traces shows that it can improve hitrate, but we need to use novel information-aware replacement policies for optimal performance. We show that our linear encoder can adapt well to changes in bandwidth, and yield better bit rates, lower buffering and lower start up delays than state-of-the-art schemes.

Demystifying 60GHz outdoor picocells
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Mobile network traffic is set to explode in our near future, driven by the growth of bandwidth-hungry media applications. Current capacity solutions, including buying spectrum, WiFi offloading, and LTE picocells, are unlikely to supply the orders-of-magnitude bandwidth increase we need. In this paper, we explore a dramatically different alternative in the form of 60GHz mmwave picocells with highly directional links. While industry is investigating other mmwave bands (e.g. 28GHz to avoid oxygen absorption), we prefer the unlicensed 60GHz band with highly directional, short-range links (~100m). 60GHz links truly reap the spatial reuse benefits of small cells while delivering high per-user data rates and leveraging efforts on indoor 60GHz PHY technology and standards. Using extensive measurements on off-the-shelf 60GHz radios and system-level simulations, we explore the feasibility of 60GHz picocells by characterizing range, attenuation due to reflections, sensitivity to movement and blockage, and interference in typical urban environments. Our results dispel some common myths, and show that there are no fundamental physical barriers to high-capacity 60GHz outdoor picocells. We conclude by identifying open challenges and associated research opportunities.

A vehicle-based measurement framework for enhancing whitespace spectrum databases
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
The present TV whitespace networks rely on spectrum occupancy databases to determine their operating channels. In this paper, we show that such databases cause non-negligible wastage of whitespace spectrum. We also report that whitespace channels can have very different quality due to interference from secondary devices and the leakage from TV broadcasts. Such disparity in channel quality is not captured by existing databases. We propose the use of spectrum measurements to overcome the above limitations of databases. In particular, we describe a system called V-Scope that leverages spectrum sensors on public vehicles to collect and report measurements from the road. These measurements are used as "anchor points" to construct various models to better determine whitespace spectrum, estimate its channel quality, and validate locations of primary and secondary devices. We have deployed our system on a single metro bus traveling across a mid-sized US city. Based on measurements collected at above 1 million locations over 120 square-km area, we find that a commercial database causes under-utilization of certain whitespace channels over a large area (up to 71% measured locations). Our system can reclaim this spectrum wastage at up to 59% locations, correctly selecting all the suitable whitespace channels at 72 -- 83% locations, and achieving a localization accuracy between 16 -- 27m.

The case for UHF-band MU-MIMO
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
While the UHF band exhibits superior propagation characteristics compared to other frequency bands used for broadband communications, limited spectral availability in time and space necessitates high spectral efficiency techniques such as Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO). In this paper we design and implement the first open MU-MIMO Software-Defined Radio (SDR) platform that operates on an order of magnitude frequency range, from 300 MHz to 5.8 GHz. We perform a comprehensive set of over-the-air experiments to evaluate the potential of UHF-band MU-MIMO in comparison to 2.4 and 5.8 GHz WiFi bands encompassing a range of operating environments. We evaluate MU-MIMO performance in both outdoor, indoor, line-of-sight (LOS), and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments, and demonstrate that while the temporal correlation of the measured UHF environment is increased, it does not come at the cost of increased spatial correlation as measured by the Demmel condition number, thus proving highly attractive for MU-MIMO. This evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of MU-MIMO transmission techniques in UHF bands for high spectral efficiency and low-overhead wireless access.

Enhancing reliability to boost the throughput over screen-camera links
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
With the rapid proliferation of camera-equipped smart devices (e.g., smartphones, pads, tablets), visible light communication (VLC) over screen-camera links emerges as a novel form of near-field communication. Such communication via smart devices is highly competitive for its user-friendliness, security, and infrastructure-less (i.e., no dependency on WiFi or cellular infrastructure). However, existing approaches mostly focus on improving the transmission speed and ignore the transmission reliability. Considering the interplay between the transmission speed and reliability towards effective end-to-end communication, in this paper, we aim to boost the throughput over screen-camera links by enhancing the transmission reliability. To this end, we propose RDCode, a robust dynamic barcode which enables a novel packet-frame-block structure. Based on the layered structure, we design different error correction schemes at three levels: intra-blocks, inter-blocks and inter-frames, in order to verify and recover the lost blocks and frames. Finally, we implement RDCode and experimentally show that RDCode reaches a high level of transmission reliability (e.g., reducing the error rate to 10%) and yields a at least doubled transmission rate, compared with the existing state-of-the-art approach COBRA.

The future of mobile computing
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2014
Jeff Gehlhaar, VP of Technology for Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. will discuss the future of mobile computing which will entail a much more personalized user experience. As the world continues to shift towards a more connected world, people are using their mobile devices in new ways and having higher expectations of what they can do with those devices. This is leading to the next frontier of mobile being much more personalized with mobile devices becoming extensions of the user, understanding where you are, where you've been and what you want to do or act on next. This is also resulting in services and applications that have traditionally been delivered via the cloud, migrating to mobile which present unique challenges and opportunities in mobile. In this talk we will explore the new and exciting technologies that Qualcomm Research is working on to advance the frontier in personalized devices and help solve some of these challenges. Starting with always on sensor processing that make basic predictions about where you are and what actions you are performing, to research in brain inspired computing and embedded cognition, Qualcomm is working to make devices which are always with you, smarter and truly personal. To further this vision of transforming the future of mobile computing, Qualcomm Research has also been working in the area of brain inspired computation and neural networks for a number of years. Early work has focused on biologically inspired approaches, involving spiking neural networks and understanding the complex behaviors of the brain. Recent advances in the industry around deep neural networks have resulted in state-of-the-art performance in machine learning pattern matching tasks. As mobile SOCs continue to gain significant computational power, bringing applications powered by deep learning to mobile devices is becoming possible. We will explore the near term opportunities like object recognition, scene classification, applications for smarter mobile cameras, automotive, and robotics. We will also look at other aspects of brain inspired computing including the potential of a new kind of low power hardware. Join Jeff as he shares his insight on how Qualcomm Research has been spearheading research to make future mobile devices smarter with the ability to "sense" and "see" their environment as humans do in a power efficient manner.

Full-duplex without strings: enabling full-duplex with half-duplex clients
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Enabling wireless full-duplex (from an AP) with multiple half-duplex (HD) clients is key to widespread adoption of full-duplex (FD) in commercial networks. However, enabling FD in such networks is fundamentally challenged by a new form of uplink-downlink interference (UDI), arising between HD clients operating simultaneously in the uplink and downlink directions. In this context, we first show that spatial interference alignment (IA) between clients is an effective and scalable technique to address UDI and hence enable FD in these networks, especially in the presence of MIMO. We then present our solution and system FDoS: Full-Duplex without Stringsthat incorporates this notion. We build the theory of applying spatial IA to full-duplex networks in general and present elegant, implementation-friendly constructions for generating IA solutions, by leveraging the structure of interference specific to these networks. In the process, FDoS shows that only four HD clients are sufficient to eliminate UDI through IA and enable 2N streams at an N transceiver AP. FDoS also includes an efficient MAC design at the AP to handle clients with heterogeneous antenna capabilities, maximize the throughput of the enabled streams in the FD session as well as reduce the overhead incurred in FDoS by half by facilitating a distributed implementation. A prototype of FDoS on WARP radios showcases its ability to address UDI effectively, and hence enable 2N streams (for N=2,4) in varied settings with just four HD clients, and sustain rate gains of 1.75-2x over HD MU-MIMO systems.

Enabling instantaneous feedback with full-duplex backscatter
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
This paper introduces the first design that enables full-duplex communication on battery-free backscatter devices. Specifically, it gives receivers a way to provide low-rate feedback to the transmitter on the same frequency as that of the backscatter transmissions, using neither multiple antennas nor power-consuming cancellation hardware. Our design achieves this goal using only fully-passive analog components that consume near-zero power. We integrate our design with the backscatter network stack and demonstrate that it can minimize energy wastes that occur due to collisions and also correct for errors and changes in channel conditions at a granularity smaller than that of a packet. To show the feasibility of our design, we build a hardware prototype using off-the-shelf analog components. Our evaluation shows that our design cancels the self-interference down to the noise floor, while consuming only 0.25 &#956;W and 0.54 &#956;W of transmit and receive power, respectively.

Strata: layered coding for scalable visual communication
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Existing code designs for display-camera based visual communication all have an all-or-nothing behavior, i.e., they assume the entire code must be decoded. However, diverse operational conditions due to device hardware diversity (in camera resolution and frame rate) and distance range motivate more scalable designs. In this paper, we borrow the notion of hierarchical modulation from traditional RF communication, and design Strata, a layered coding scheme for visual communication. Strata can support a range of frame capture resolutions and rates, and deliver information rates correspondingly. Strata embeds information at multiple granularity into the same code area spatially or the same frame interval temporally. It ensures all layers are decodable independently, by controlling the amount of interference between adjacent layers. Further, our design is recursive and extends readily to generate more layers. Compared with existing codes, it significantly extends the operational range, though at the expense of less capacity than a single-layer code.

It starts with iGaze: visual attention driven networking with smart glasses
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
In this work, we explore a new networking mechanism with smart glasses, through which users can express their interest and connect to a target simply by a gaze. Doing this, we attempt to let wearable devices understand human attention and intention, and pair devices carried by users according to such attention and intention. To achieve this ambitious goal, we propose a proof-of-concept system iGaze, a visual attention driven networking suite: an iGaze glass (hardware), and a networking protocol VAN (software). Our glass, iGaze glass, is a low-cost head-mounted glass with a camera, orientation sensors, microphone and speakers, which are embedded with our software for visual attention capture and networking. A visual attention driven networking protocol (VAN) is carefully designed and implemented. In VAN, we design an energy efficient and highly accurate visual attention determination scheme using single camera to capture user's communication interest and a double-matching scheme based on visual direction detection and Doppler effect of acoustic signal to lock the target devices. Using our system, we conduct a series of trials for various application scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.

Wireless barcodes for tagging infrastructure
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
There are numerous scenarios where embedding static information into objects would prove to be very useful. For example, by embedding navigation information into the road surface we could enable driverless cars, similarly embedding information into major infrastructure such as building walls would enable easier classification of debris, and so forth. The key requirement is that the embedded information should survive as long as the infrastructure itself. We discuss the concept of wireless barcodes that allow us to achieve exactly this goal of tagging infrastructure. The barcodes are designed to be read at terahertz frequencies that allows good packing of information (bits/m). We use a TDoA (Time Difference of Arrival) technique to read the barcodes which provides robustness to wear and tear of the surface. This paper reports on the results of an experimental study that examines the challenges in building such barcodes and demonstrates the idea by constructing such a barcode.

Enabling physical analytics in retail stores using smart glasses
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
We consider the problem of tracking physical browsing by users in indoor spaces such as retail stores. Analogous to online browsing, where users choose to go to certain webpages, dwell on a subset of pages of interest to them, and click on links of interest while ignoring others, we can draw parallels in the physical setting, where a user might walk purposefully to a section of interest, dwell there for a while, gaze at specific items, and reach out for the ones that they wish to examine more closely. As our first contribution, we design techniques to track each of these elements of physical browsing using a combination of a first-person vision enabled by smart glasses, and inertial sensing using both the glasses and a smartphone. We address key challenges, including energy efficiency by using the less expensive inertial sensors to trigger the more expensive vision processing. Second, during gazing, we present a method for identifying the item(s) within view that the user is likely to focus on based on measuring the orientation of the user's head. Finally, unlike in the online context, where every webpage is just a click away, proximity is important in the physical browsing setting. To enable the tracking of nearby items, even if outside the field of view, we use data gathered from smart-glasses-enabled users to infer the product layout using a novel technique called AutoLayout. Further, we show how such inferences made from a small population of smart-glasses-enabled users could aid in tracking the physical browsing by the many smartphone-only users.

Enfold: downclocking OFDM in WiFi
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has long been used as a technique to save power in a variety of computing domains but typically not in communications devices. A fundamental limit that prevents decreasing the clock frequency is the Nyquist(-Shannon) sampling theorem, which states that the sampling rate must be twice the signal bandwidth. Recently, researchers have leveraged compressive sensing to demonstrate the possibility of decoding a sparse signal below Nyquist rate. In this work, we dramatically extend the state of the art by showing how to decode non-sparse signals, in particular, OFDM systems at sub-Nyquist rates. We exploit the aliasing that results from under-sampling and observe that there exists well-defined structure in terms of how OFDM signals are "folded up" under aliasing. Based on our observations, we present Enfold, which allows existing WiFi chipsets to decode standards-compliant WiFi frames while operating at 50% and 25% of their rated clock rate. Our design is able to attain greater than 96% and 83% raw packet reception rates for moderate SNR while reducing the clock rate by 2x and 4x, respectively. Moreover, our approach can be easily applied to other communication systems based on OFDM modulation. When evaluated on popular smartphone app traces, Enfold reduces energy consumption by up to 34%.

Combating inter-cell interference in 802.11ac-based multi-user MIMO networks
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
In an 802.11ac-based MU-MIMO network comprised of multiple cells1, inter-cell interference allows only a single AP to serve its clients at the same time, significantly limiting the network capacity. In this work, we overcome this limitation by letting the APs and clients in interfering cells coordinately cancel the inter-cell interference using their antennas for beamforming. To achieve such coordinated interference cancellation in a practical way, we propose a novel two-step optimization. First, without requiring any channel knowledge, each AP and client optimizes the use of its antennas for either data communication or inter-cell interference cancellation, in order to maximize the total number of deliverable streams in the MU-MIMO network. Second, with only partial channel knowledge, each AP and client optimizes their beamforming weights after the optimal antenna usage has been identified in the first step. Our solution, CoaCa, integrates this two-step optimization into 802.11ac with small modifications and negligible overhead, allowing each AP and client to locally perform the two-step optimization. Our experimental evaluation indicates that for a MU-MIMO network with two cells, by cancelling the inter-cell interference CoaCa can convert the majority of the expected number of streams increase (50%-67%) into network capacity improvement (41%-52%).

Phaser: enabling phased array signal processing on commodity WiFi access points
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Signal processing on antenna arrays has received much recent attention in the mobile and wireless networking research communities, with array signal processing approaches addressing the problems of human movement detection, indoor mobile device localization, and wireless network security. However, there are two important challenges inherent in the design of these systems that must be overcome if they are to be of practical use on commodity hardware. First, phase differences between the radio oscillators behind each antenna can make readings unusable, and so must be corrected in order for most techniques to yield high-fidelity results. Second, while the number of antennas on commodity access points is usually limited, most array processing increases in fidelity with more antennas. These issues work in synergistic opposition to array processing: without phase offset correction, no phase-difference array processing is possible, and with fewer antennas, automatic correction of these phase offsets becomes even more challenging. We present Phaser, a system that solves these intertwined problems to make phased array signal processing truly practical on the many WiFi access points deployed in the real world. Our experimental results on three- and five-antenna 802.11-based hardware show that 802.11 NICs can be calibrated and synchronized to a 20&#176; median phase error, enabling inexpensive deployment of numerous phase-difference based spectral analysis techniques previously only available on costly, special-purpose hardware.

BBN: throughput scaling in dense enterprise WLANs with Bind Beamforming and Nulling
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Today's Enterprise Wireless LANs are comprised of densely deployed access points. This paper proposes BBN, an interference nulling scheme that leverages the high density of access points to enable multiple mobile devices to transmit simultaneously to multiple access points (APs), all within a single collision domain. BBN also leverages the capability of the APs to communicate with each other on the wired backbone to migrate most of the decoding complexity to the APs, while keeping the design at the mobile clients simple. Finally, we leverage the static nature of the access points to make BBN more practical in networks where the mobility of clients inhibit the use of traditional interference alignment schemes. We implement a prototype of BBN on USRP testbed showing its feasibility. The experiment results show that BBN provides a throughput gain of 1.48X over omniscient TDMA. Results from our trace-driven simulations show that BBN obtains a throughput of up to 5.6X over omniscient TDMA.

Discovering fine-grained RRC state dynamics and performance impacts in cellular networks
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
To conserve power while ensuring good performance on resource-constrained mobile devices, devices transition between different Radio Resource Control (RRC) states in response to network traffic and according to parameters specific to network operators. As RRC states significantly affect application power consumption and performance, it is important to understand how RRC state timers interact with network traffic patterns. In this paper, we show that the impact of RRC states on performance is significantly more complex and diverse than found in previous work. To do so, we introduce an open-source tool that allows the impact of RRC states on network and application performance to be measured in a robust and accurate manner on unmodified user devices, and deploy the tool in 23 countries around the world to test a broad range of cellular network technologies. We detect previously unknown performance problems which increase network latencies by up to several seconds and for LTE, can increase packet losses by an order of magnitude. Through an in-depth cross-layer analysis of several carriers, we examine the lower-layer causes of these problems. We determine that the highly complex state transitions of certain carriers, and in particular poor interactions between state demotions and network traffic, can lead to substantial, unexpected latencies.

A practical traffic management system for integrated LTE-WiFi networks
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Mobile operators are leveraging WiFi to relieve the pressure posed on their networks by the surging bandwidth demand of applications. However, operators often lack intelligent mechanisms to control the way users access their WiFi networks. This lack of sophisticated control creates poor network utilization, which in turn degrades the quality of experience (QoE). To meet user traffic demands, it is evident that operators need solutions that optimally balance user traffic across cellular and WiFi networks. Motivated by the lack of practical solutions in this space, we design and implement ATOM - an end-to-end system for adaptive traffic offloading for WiFi-LTE deployments. ATOM has two novel components: (i) A network interface selection algorithm that maps user traffic across WiFi and LTE to optimize user QoE and (ii) an interface switching service that seamlessly re-directs ongoing user sessions in a cost-effective and standards-compatible manner. Our evaluations on a real LTE-WiFi testbed using YouTube traffic reveals that ATOM reduces video stalls by 3-4 times compared to naive solutions.

Exploring human mobility with multi-source data at extremely large metropolitan scales
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Expanding our knowledge about human mobility is essential for building efficient wireless protocols and mobile applications. Previous human mobility studies have typically been built upon empirical single-source data (e.g., cellphone or transit data), which inevitably introduces a bias against residents not contributing this type of data, e.g., call detail records cannot be obtained from the residents without cellphone activities, and transit data cannot cover the residents who walk or ride private vehicles. To address this issue, we propose and implement a novel architecture mPat to explore human mobility using multi-source data. A reference implementation of mPat was developed at an unprecedented scale upon the urban infrastructures of Shenzhen, China. The novelty and uniqueness of mPat lie in its three layers: (i) a data feed layer consisting of real-time data feeds from 24 thousand vehicles, 16 million smart cards and 10 million cellphones; (ii) a mobility abstraction layer exploring the correlation and divergence among the multi-source data to analyze and infer human mobility; and (iii) an application layer to improve urban efficiency based on the human mobility findings of the study. The evaluation shows that mPat achieves a 75% inference accuracy, and that its real-world application reduces passenger travel time by 36%.

Modeling web quality-of-experience on cellular networks
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Recent studies have shown that web browsing is one of the most prominent cellular applications. It is therefore important for cellular network operators to understand how radio network characteristics (such as signal strength, handovers, load, etc.) influence users' web browsing Quality-of-Experience (web QoE). Understanding the relationship between web QoE and network characteristics is a pre-requisite for cellular network operators to detect when and where degraded network conditions actually impact web QoE. Unfortunately, cellular network operators do not have access to detailed server-side or client-side logs to directly measure web QoE metrics, such as abandonment rate and session length. In this paper, we first devise a machine-learning-based mechanism to infer web QoE metrics from network traces accurately. We then present a large-scale study characterizing the impact of network characteristics on web QoE using a month-long anonymized dataset collected from a major cellular network provider. Our results show that improving signal-to-noise ratio, decreasing load and reducing handovers can improve user experience. We find that web QoE is very sensitive to inter-radio-access-technology (IRAT) handovers. We further find that higher radio data link rate does not necessarily lead to better web QoE. Since many network characteristics are interrelated, we also use machine learning to accurately model the influence of radio network characteristics on user experience metrics. This model can be used by cellular network operators to prioritize the improvement of network factors that most influence web QoE.

Where are you from?: confusing location distinction using virtual multipath camouflage
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
In wireless networks, location distinction aims to detect location changes or facilitate authentication of wireless users. To achieve location distinction, recent research has been focused on investigating the spatial uncorrelation property of wireless channels. Specifically, the differences of wireless channel characteristics are used to distinguish locations or identify location changes. However, we discover a new attack against all existing location distinction approaches that are built on the spatial uncorrelation property of wireless channels. In such an attack, the adversary can easily hide her location changes or impersonate movements by injecting fake wireless channel characteristics into a target receiver. Experimental results on our USRP-based prototype show that the discovered attack can craft any desired channel characteristic with a successful probability of 95.0% to defeat spatial uncorrelation based location distinction schemes. To defend against this attack, we propose a detection technique that utilizes an auxiliary receiver or antenna to identify these fake channel characteristics. Experiments demonstrate that our novel detection method achieves a detection rate higher than 91.2% while maintaining a very low false alarm rate.

Tagoram: real-time tracking of mobile RFID tags to high precision using COTS devices
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
In many applications, we have to identify an object and then locate the object to within high precision (centimeter- or millimeter-level). Legacy systems that can provide such accuracy are either expensive or suffering from performance degradation resulting from various impacts, e.g., occlusion for computer vision based approaches. In this work, we present an RFID-based system, Tagoram, for object localization and tracking using COTS RFID tags and readers. Tracking mobile RFID tags in real time has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving high precision. Our system achieves these three goals by leveraging the phase value of the backscattered signal, provided by the COTS RFID readers, to estimate the location of the object. In Tagoram, we exploit the tag's mobility to build a virtual antenna array by using readings from a few physical antennas over a time window. To illustrate the basic idea of our system, we firstly focus on a simple scenario where the tag is moving along a fixed track known to the system. We propose Differential Augmented Hologram (DAH) which will facilitate the instant tracking of the mobile RFID tag to a high precision. We then devise a comprehensive solution to accurately recover the tag's moving trajectories and its locations, relaxing the assumption of knowing tag's track function in advance. We have implemented the Tagoram system using COTS RFID tags and readers. The system has been tested extensively in the lab environment and used for more than a year in real airline applications. For lab environment, we can track the mobile tags in real time with a millimeter accuracy to a median of 5mm and 7.29mm using linear and circular track respectively. In our year- long large scale baggage sortation systems deployed in two airports, our results from real deployments show that Tagoram can achieve a centimeter-level accuracy to a median of 6.35cm in these real deployments.

Jigsaw: indoor floor plan reconstruction via mobile crowdsensing
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
The lack of floor plans is a critical reason behind the current sporadic availability of indoor localization service. Service providers have to go through effort-intensive and time-consuming business negotiations with building operators, or hire dedicated personnel to gather such data. In this paper, we propose Jigsaw, a floor plan reconstruction system that leverages crowdsensed data from mobile users. It extracts the position, size and orientation information of individual landmark objects from images taken by users. It also obtains the spatial relation between adjacent landmark objects from inertial sensor data, then computes the coordinates and orientations of these objects on an initial floor plan. By combining user mobility traces and locations where images are taken, it produces complete floor plans with hallway connectivity, room sizes and shapes. Our experiments on 3 stories of 2 large shopping malls show that the 90-percentile errors of positions and orientations of landmark objects are about 1~2m and 5~9&#176;, while the hallway connectivity is 100% correct.

We present a real-time software-defined radio (SDR) platform for prototyping and measuring the performance of broadband UHF radio networks operating over long distances with point-to-multipoint (PTMP) non-line-of-sight (NLOS) networks. Enabled by the Wideband UHF Radio Card (WURC), a custom high-power and frequency-flexible radio transceiver daughter-card for FPGA-based digital basebands, the 802.11 DCF-like MAC and PHY implementation is completely open source. We demonstrate a long-range PTMP NLOS network bonding several of the white space television channels available in Maui, Hawaii. Off-the-shelf client devices can use this network via 802.11a/g links implemented with the same SDR framework. The multi-carrier channel estimates and real-time MAC statistics of connected nodes in UHF and 2.4 GHz are recorded and displayed in real-time, demonstrating an unprecedented amount of flexibility in unlicensed frequency bands, enabling real-time TV-band cognitive networks and small-cell research deployments.

Demo: real-time MU-MIMO channel analysis with a custom 802.11 implementation
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
We present a demonstration of the real-time capture and analysis of multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) channel state information from commercial Wi-Fi devices. Our system is built with an array of WARP v3 nodes running the Mango Communications 802.11 Reference Design, an open-source, real-time FPGA implementation of the 802.11a/g MAC and PHY. One WARP v3 node acts as an 802.11 access point (AP), which serves Internet access to client devices. The other nodes implement an array of multi-antenna 802.11 monitors. Every monitor node simultaneously receives packets transmitted by the Wi-Fi clients associated with the AP. The nodes extract MAC headers and channel estimates from each packet and offload these to a PC for analysis. All MAC, PHY, and channel analysis processes run in real time.

Demo: ShadowMaps, the urban phone tracking system
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Due to frequent non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal reception, geopositioning using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS, is unreliable in urban environments, with errors on the order of tens of meters. This poses a major problem for mobile services that benefit from accurate urban localization, such as navigation, geofencing, and hyperlocal advertising applications. Mobile network operators also seek improvements in localization, as government regulators increase handset location accuracy requirements of enhanced 991 service (e911). In our demonstration, we will present the most recent prototype of our urban location improvement technology, called ShadowMaps, which will be shown to accurately track a mobile device in an urban environment, with up to an order of magnitude reduction in GNSS positioning error.

Demo: simulating the impact of communication performance on road traffic safety at intersections
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Performance evaluation of communication protocols is usually carried out using typical network metrics as delay, jitter, or goodput. However, recent studies in the context of Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) have shown that using these metrics is not sufficient for evaluating vehicular safety applications. To highlight the importance of safety metrics and their applicability, we extended our existing simulation framework Veins to visualize these metrics live while the road traffic and network simulation are running in parallel. In particular, we demonstrate the impact of communication on intersection assistance applications. To simulate different intersection approaches, we implemented a simulation model that resembles different kinds of driver behavior and enables crashes at intersections. The resulting situations are displayed in the road traffic simulator and give the visitor insights on the current state of endangered vehicles. Furthermore, an autonomous controller has been implemented which tries to avoid accidents and hence shows the real-world impact, i.e., accidents can be avoided using advanced beaconing techniques. To increase interactivity of the demo, visitors will have the possibility to interact with and take control over endangered vehicles.

A co-primary spectrum sharing trial is presented in this paper. It is presenting a flexible way to share resources between multiple operators in order to increase spectral efficiency. In this trial the differences in traffic patterns of the mobile network operators are exploited to ease up the peak traffic demands of particular operator. This shared recourse is also usable for inter-operator D2D communication, when two users of different operators want to communicate and operators need to negotiate resource allocation for this communication link. We will also introduce Wireless Open Access Research Platform as our choice for the implementation of this trial.

Demo: Luxapose: indoor positioning with mobile phones and visible light
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2014
We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires. The luminaires - modified to allow rapid, on-off keying - transmit their identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical pulses. A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image, decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires. Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position updates. The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be solved with optimization techniques.

In a modern conference room, various of video and audio devices are provided to ensure efficient communications. This is commonly referred to as a conferencing system. Compared to wired conferencing systems, wireless systems require less deployment effort, but may become unreliable when the selected radio spectrum is highly occupied. This demo focuses on improving the quality of service of a commercial wireless conferencing system using dynamic channel selection based on real-time spectrum sensing. The proposed solution is verified in a large-scale wireless testbed, and the result shows that the link of the conferencing system is indeed more robust against interference when cognitive solution is applied.

Demo: OpenAirInterface: an open LTE network in a PC
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2014
LTE 4G cellular networks are gradually being adopted by all major operators in the world and are expected to rule the cellular landscape at least for the current decade. They will also form the starting point for further progress beyond the current generation of mobile cellular networks to chalk a path towards fifth generation mobile networks. The lack of open cellular ecosystem has limited applied research in this field within the boundaries of vendor and operator R&D groups. Furthermore, several new approaches and technologies are being considered as potential elements making up such a future mobile network, including cloudification of radio network, radio network programability and APIs following SDN principles, native support of machine-type communication, and massive MIMO. Research on these technologies requires realistic and flexible experimentation platforms that offer a wide range of experimentation modes from real-world experimentation to controlled and scalable evaluations while at the same time retaining backward compatibility with current generation systems. In this work, we present OpenAirInterface (OAI) as a suitably flexible platform towards open LTE ecosystem and playground [1]. We will demonstrate an example of the use of OAI to deploy a low-cost open LTE network using commodity hardware with standard LTE-compatible devices. We also show the reconfigurability features of the platform.

Demo: TV white space networking capabilities and potential with an embedded & open-API platform
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2014
Over the past decade, white space networking has garnered significant effort and attention from media, industry, regulators, and academics world-wide. Together, these entities have helped push white space in to a unique position of potentially changing how we access the spectrum (more efficiently) forever. Now, building white space networks with full-featured and fully certified equipment is critical in moving forward and retaining the spectrum and position that we have put ourselves in. In our demonstration, we will exhibit a fully embedded and FCC-certified white space networking platform that is available and capable of building out TV white space networks. Additionally, we provide an interactive display with data taken from our commercial deployments that further show its capabilities of supporting various applications. Using the many available channels at the conference location, we will demonstrate some of these capabilities (e.g., ability to penetrate in-door environments), as well as future capabilities (e.g., novel functionality built on the platform). With an open-API (across all layers), the platform is conducive to studying current capabilities and novel research.

Demo: software defined radio: on a smartphone, as an app!
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
In this demo, we showcase the first software defined radio (SDR) implementation that runs on today's smartphones. Using the SDR, the smartphones are shown to talk to real IEEE 802.15.4 devices such as sensor motes or Phillips Hue (TM) lightbulbs that otherwise they cannot natively communicate with. Furthermore, we make the SDR available as downloadable software ("app") on Google app store, so that anyone may freely download, use, and purge on his or her smartphone, independently of OS upgrades. Detaching SDR from OS allows almost immediate deployment of wireless rotocols, and only on the phones that do need them. By enabling smartphones to speak non-native protocols in this manner, smartphone vendors will be able to support a wide range of wireless protocols without investing separate hardware and real estate in their devices. A promising application area for this concept could be Internet of Things (IoT), where protocols are diverse, typically low-speed, and not well supported by today's smartphones. Therefore, we believe that the smartphones with SDR will become a strong enabler or facilitator of many interesting applications in the IoT environment. We also believe that the concept of wireless protocol as a smartphone app will accelerate wireless protocol design-test-deployment cycle, catalyzing wireless protocol evolutions on smartphones.

Demo: rollinglight - universal camera communications for single led
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Camera communication (CamCom) is a form of visible light communication (VLC) that makes use of a camera as the receiver. One very important advantage of CamCom is that the acquired images during the receiving process provide a means to visually associate the physical object with the transmitted information, since the receiver has the knowledge of which pixels in the images are transmitting. Figure 1 shows a simple example. A user points her smartphone camera at multiple lights, touches the screen to select one, and uses the virtual switch that appears on the screen to adjust the lighting level. In this scenario, the lights simply periodically transmit simple identifiers, such as IP addresses, to the smartphone. The system is able to directly associate what the user sees (the image pixels corresponding to the light selected by the user) to the transmitted information (the identifier of the light). An out-of-band channel, such as WiFi, can then be used to send the actual command to the selected light to adjust the setting. Compared to the conventional approach of identifying a particular set of visual features unique to the object with computer vision techniques, this approach is simpler, more intuitive, and more accurate.

Demo: a robust barcode system for data transmissions over screen-camera links
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Visible light communication (VLC) over screen-camera links emerges as a novel form of near-field communication, and it offers a user-friendly, infrastructure-less and secure communication, which is highly competitive for one-time file transfer [1 - 4]. However, the limitations of smart devices and the uncertainty of user behaviors seriously impair the transmission reliability and hinder its applicability. Worse still, existing approaches [1, 2, 4]mostly focus on improving the transmission speed and ignore the transmission reliability. Hence, RDCode is proposed to boost the throughput over screen-camera links, by making use of a novel barcode design and several effective techniques to enhance the transmission reliability. In this demo, we show that our RDCode prototype system addresses many practical challenges. A short video on our prototype system is accessible from http://mashuai.buaa.edu.cn/demo/RDCode.mp4.

Demo: high-precision RFID tracking using COTS devies
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
In many applications, we have to identify an object and then locate the object to within high precision (centimeter- or millimeter-level). Tracking mobile RFID tags in real time has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving high precision. We achieve these three goals by leveraging the phase value of the backscattered signal, provided by the COTS RFID readers, to estimate the location of the object. To illustrate the basic idea of our system, we firstly focus on a simple scenario where the tag is moving along a fixed track known to the system. We propose Differential Augmented Hologram (DAH) which will facilitate the instant tracking of the mobile RFID tag to a high precision. We then devise a comprehensive solution to accurately recover the tag's moving trajectory and its locations, relaxing the assumption of knowing tag's track function in advance.

Our glass is a low-cost head-mounted glass with a camera, orientation sensors, microphone and speakers, which are embedded with our software for visual attention capture and networking. A visual attention driven networking protocol (VAN) is carefully designed and implemented. In VAN, we design an energy efficient and highly accurate visual attention determination scheme using single camera to capture user's communication interest and a double-matching scheme based on visual direction detection and Doppler effect of acoustic signal to lock the target devices. iGaze has separated and modularized hardware and software design. It can run on top of existing networking protocols, e.g., Wi-Fi.

Poster: clock synchronization for distributed wireless protocols at the physical layer
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Implementing distributed wireless protocols at the physical layer today is challenging because different nodes have different clocks, each of which has slightly different frequencies. This causes the nodes to have frequency offset relative to each other. As a result, transmitted signals from these nodes do not combine in a predictable manner over time. Past work tackles this challenge and builds distributed PHY layer systems by attempting to address the effects of the frequency offset and compensating for it in the transmitted signals. In this extended abstract, we address this challenge by addressing the root cause - the different clocks with different frequencies on the different nodes. We present AirClock, a new wireless coordination primitive that enables multiple nodes to act as if they are driven by a single clock that they receive wirelessly over the air. AirClock presents a synchronized abstraction to the physical layer, and hence enables direct implementation of diverse kinds of distributed PHY protocols. We illustrate AirClock's versatility by using it to build two different systems: (1) distributed MIMO, and (2) distributed rate adaptation for wireless sensors, and show that they can provide significant performance benefits over today's systems.

Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2014
Geometrical distance distribution (GDD) between nodes in wireless communication networks plays a significant role in modeling network performance metrics. Existing work on obtaining GDD assumes the network geometry to be a regular one, such as circle and square. Due to the various complex effects of wireless signals, however, the network geometry usually is quite irregular. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel systematic and unified approach to obtain the GDD between two random nodes associated with arbitrary network geometries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that will fill the gap in the literature of this field.

Poster: overheard ACK with token passing: an optimization to 802.11 MAC protocol
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) is defined in IEEE 802.11 standard, which is widely used in practice. Despite of its wide use, it has several limitations. Because of the idle and collision times, it suffers from poor channel utilization. Besides, the control packets, particularly, Acknowledgement (ACK), consume non-trivial amount of bandwidth. Though the number of control bits in an ACK frame is small, the added overheads like the preamble, packet header etc. make the situation worse. In this paper, we propose a scheme called Overheard ACK where the explicit ACK frame has been eliminated by using the leverage of packet overhearing. Also, by incorporating explicit and implicit token-passing, this protocol attempts to schedule transmissions without having to use random access, dramatically reducing the idle time and collision time. Simulation results using NS2 confirm that this protocol significantly outperforms the conventional 802.11 DCF.

Poster: in-lane communication framework using smartphone's inertial sensors
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
In this paper, we describe the in-lane communication framework that enables the communication between vehicles on the same lane. The system creates a unique signature for each lane using smartphone inertial sensors. The calculated lane signature will be attached with each broadcasted message, where other vehicles on the street compare it with their own lane signature to decide if the received message came from a vehicle on the same lane or not. The paper concentrates on finding the right features that can be used to identify a lane in a road. To identify a lane with a unique signature, the paper proposes a combination of driving features and road features. The paper uses the inertial sensors because the current GPS systems are not accurate enough to locate vehicles with a lane level accuracy. The ability to establish a communication channel between vehicles on the same lane can enhance the road safety and enable several interesting navigation applications.

2014
Two-dimensional barcodes are widely used in mobile advertisement business, while their decoding performance is not always satisfactory under uncontrolled environments. The corner detection accuracy has been identified as a critical factor affecting the overall system performance. The standard barcode detector performs a candidate search in the binarized barcode image based on the rectangular shape of the barcode. Its performance is not very accurate due to the limited accuracy of the binarized image. In this work, we proposed a coarse-fine corner detection approach for locating the barcode region. It performs far more accurately than the standard barcode detection scheme while keeps the computational complexity affordable. Experimental results for high capacity barcodes show that the proposed detection scheme can extend the range of operation parameters, such as wider angles, and much lower the detection bit error rate, relative to the standard barcode decoder.

Nowadays, distracted driving is becoming a very dangerous epidemic on the roadways. A lot of activities may lead to distracted driving, such as texting, making phone calls, using GPS or road maps, eating, using in-car entertainment systems, etc. As the number of smartphones is rapidly growing year by year, using smartphone is by far the most dangerous and alarming driver distraction. In this paper, we design an app on iPhone for reducing the smartphone-related distracted driving, which can run in the background and can lock the smartphone screen with no passwords required when it detects that the user is driving. After the user finishes driving, the lock will be removed immediately. We also describe a DTM algorithm to detect the transportation mode and give the performance analysis of our system. The results show that our system can save more energy than other related applications.

We present Ziria, the first software-defined radio programming platform that is both easily programmable and performant. Ziria introduces a novel programming model tailored to wireless physical layer tasks and captures the inherent and important distinction between data and control paths in this domain. Ziria provides the capability of implementing a real-time WiFi PHY running at 20 MHz.

Driving is an integral part of our everyday lives, but it is also a time when people are uniquely vulnerable. Poor road condition, traffic congestion and long driving time may bring negative emotion to drivers and increase the chance of traffic accidents.

SAfeDJ aims at helping drivers to diminish fatigue and negative emotion. It is built on a vehicular healthcare platform that enables communications among drivers and integrates with multiple types of sensors to promote safe driving. Prototype implementation and initial results of SAfeDJ have demonstrated its desired functionality in drivers' daily lives and feasibility for real-world deployment.

Poster: a framework for instant mobile web browsing with smart prefetching and caching
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2014
Mobile users often suffer from a slow page loading time due to intermittently connected wireless networks and increasing size of mobile Web pages. Although existing approaches of prefetching and caching are widely used to reduce the browsing latency, they may fail to work effectively because most Web page visits are singletons and the cache hit ratio is unsatisfying. In this work, we design and implement a framework to reduce Web browsing latency for mobile users with a smart prefetching strategy and caching mechanism. The prefetching strategy leverages the skSLRU model, which predicts and prefetches Web pages based on their contents with consideration of user contexts and the devices' status such as power consuming and cellular data usage. And our caching mechanism mainly consider the resources like CSS and JavaScript files shared among Web pages in a website. Moreover, instead of using RAM, we use ROM, the internal flash memory of devices to store cached resources with proper lifecycle so as to avoid the useful resources to be untimely evicted or expired and thus improve the hit ratio. Our evaluations show that 90% of the homepages and 60% of other pages are fetched before users' visiting, and the page loading time is no more than one second.

2014
This poster proposes an adaptive flow control scheme for reliable packet delivery of Universal Serial Bus (USB) services when they are transmitted through wireless medium. In the future, USB can be utilized with the Wi-Fi technology to provide Wi-Fi USB (WSB). However, the data transmission of Wi-Fi and USB are asynchronous due to their different Medium Access Control (MAC) characteristics, which may result in buffer overflow. To prevent buffer overflow, we propose an adaptive flow control scheme that can select between the various transmission speeds of USB to match with the bandwidth provided by the Wi-Fi layer. Preliminary results of the proposed scheme evaluated via the NS-3 shows that the packet delivery ratio of USB data can be substantially increased, thus providing better USB reliability.

SensingKit is capable of continuous sensing the device's motion (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer), location (GPS) and proximity to other smartphones (Bluetooth Smart). The data are temporarily saved to the device's memory and transmitted to a server for further analysis over any Internet connection. We believe that this platform will be beneficial to all researchers and developers who need to perform mobile sensing in their applications and experiments.

Locating objects labeled with RFID tags is an important issue which should be addressed in many applications, such as warehouse management, goods management in supermarket and finding of lost objects. Some existing works use large numbers of reference tags which involve lots of manpower to deploy them. Others achieve high accuracy, but rely on sophisticated equipments which are hardly available in large scale to the industry. This work exploits the radiation pattern of existing directional panel antenna which is steerable and derives angle-of-arrival (AoA) information from the energy reflected by the target tag when the antenna is rotating. We use Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipments and get median position accuracy of 29cm in our preliminary experiment.

We present HiLight, a new form of screen-camera communication without the need of any coded images (e.g. barcodes) for off-the-shelf smart devices. HiLight hides information underlying any images shown on a LED or an OLED screen, so that camera-equipped smart devices can fetch the information by turning their cameras to the screen. HiLight achieves this by leveraging the orthogonal transparency (alpha) channel, a well-known concept in computer graphics, to embed bits into pixel translucency changes without the need of modifying pixel color values. We demonstrated HiLight's feasibility using smartphones. By offering an unobtrusive, flexible, and lightweight communication channel between screens and cameras, HiLight opens up opportunities for new HCI and context-aware applications to emerge, e.g. smart glass communicates with screens for additional personalized information to realize augmented reality.

While computer vision algorithms and libraries have enabled and accelerated the adoption of vision processing into mobile and wearable applications, vision is a resource-hungry operation, and is thus not efficient enough to run on multiple applications simultaneously. However, we observe that many vision algorithms share identical sets of frames and features to perform their analyses, computed from the same library calls. Leveraging this observation, we design a split-process architecture to retrofit existing vision libraries to allow applications to transparently share the computational, memory, and energy overhead of vision processing.

Unlike previous work, AirEye blindly extracts cyclic features from received waveform and performs classification without any prior knowledge on the transmitted signals. Although AirEye uses only a narrowband radio, it can still identify any signal that is wider than the radio bandwidth. Finally, AirEye exploits the signal sparsity in both radio and cyclic frequency dimensions to significantly speedup the feature extraction.

Recently, millimeter wave communications in 60 GHz band have attracted considerable attention from academia, industry, and standards bodies. To overcome huge propagation loss, high gain directional antennas are used. Consequently, concurrent transmissions (spatial reuse) are enabled within a basic service set (BSS) and even among BSSs, which provides huge potential to improve the network capacity. In this paper, we propose a software-defined mmWave network architecture, where a centralized controller is introduced by abstracting the cross-layer control functions from the network layer to physical layer. Efficient coordination is achieved in this architecture to maximize the spatial reuse.

In this work we describe a general method using only the lightweight sensors on a smartphone to detect if a device is indoor or outdoor. Using semi-supervised machine learning techniques, our method automatically learns characteristics of new environments and devices, thereby achieves detection accuracy of over 90% even in unfamiliar circumstances. Therefore, it easily outperforms existing indoor-outdoor detection techniques based on static algorithms, or relying on energy hungry and unreliable GPS.

Poster: styrofoam: a tightly packed coding scheme for camera-based visible light communication
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Screen-to-camera visible-light communication links are fundamentally limited by inter-symbol interference, in which the camera receives multiple overlapping symbols in a single capture exposure. By determining interference constraints, we are able to decode symbols with multi-bit depth across all three color channels. We present Styrofoam, a coding scheme which optimally satisfies the constraints by inserting blank frames into the transmission pattern. The coding scheme improves upon the state-of-the-art in camera-based visible-light communication by: (1) ensuring a decode with at least half-exposure of colored multi-bit symbols, (2) limiting decode latency to two transmission frames, and (3) transmitting 0.4 bytes per grid block at the slowest camera's frame rate. In doing so, we outperform peer unsynchronized VLC transmission schemes by 2.9x. Our implementation on smartphone displays and cameras achieves 69.1 kbps.

Poster: hearing your breathing: fine-grained sleep monitoring using smartphones
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Sleep monitoring has drawn increasingly attention as the quality and quantity of the sleep are important for maintaining a person's health and well-being. For example, inadequate and irregular sleep are usually associated with serious health problems such as fatigue, depression and cardiovascular disease. Traditional sleep monitoring systems, such as PSG, involve wearable sensors with professional installations, and thus are limited to clinical usage. Recent work in using smartphone sensors for sleep monitoring can detect several events related to sleep, such as body movement, cough and snore. Such coarse-grained sleep monitoring however is unable to detect the breathing rate which is a vital sign and health indicator. This work presents a fine-grained sleep monitoring system which is capable of detecting the breathing rate by leveraging smartphones. Our system exploits the readily available smartphone earphone that placed close to the user to capture the breath sound reliably. Given the captured acoustic signal, our system performs noise reduction to remove environmental noise and then identifies the breathing rate based on the signal envelope detection. Our experimental evaluation of six subjects over six months time period demonstrates that the breathing rate monitoring is highly accurate and robust under various environments. This strongly indicates the feasibility of using the smartphone and its earphone to perform continuous and noninvasive fine-grained sleep monitoring.

Programming wireless networks requires accounting for multiple complex operations, such as monitoring interference and allocating radio resources. Employing the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm eases the implementation of such tasks when augmented with suitable high-level programming abstractions. In this work, we present a set of programming abstractions modeling three fundamental aspects of a wireless networks, namely state management, resource provisioning, and network state collection. We also describe our proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed abstractions focusing on WiFi networks and show its use for realizing typical control tasks such as mobility management and traffic engineering as Network Apps.

Poster: come closer: proximity-based authentication for the internet of things
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
This paper presents a proximity-based authentication approach for the Internet of Things (IoT) that works in-band by solely utilizing the wireless communication interface. The novelty of this approach lies in its reliance on ambient radio signals to infer proximity within about one second, and in its ability to expose imposters located several meters away. We identify relevant features sensed from the RF channel to establish a notion of proximity across co-located low-power devices. We introduce our proximity-based authentication protocol and show the feasibility of our approach with an early prototype using off-the-shelf 802.15.4 sensors and an evaluation conducted in a real-world environment.

Scalability and sustainability are two fundamental requirements in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Inch scale sensor nodes can operate unattended for long periods if they have sufficient energy sources. In this work, a Self-Powered Sensor Network (SPSN) testbed is introduced. SPSN is cost-efficient and has large-scale deployability. It combines cognitive networking principles with efficient routing approaches and energy harvesting techniques. SPSN is used for indoor CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring as well as for outdoor gas leak detection. The performance of the system for channel estimation at an outdoor environment is examined. Experimental results show that SPSN can be used for a plethora of other applications as well.

Poster - SEA-OR: spectrum and energy aware opportunistic routing for self-powered wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
An appealing solution for unattended surveillance and monitoring applications is Self-powered Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). One of the main reasons is that the energy which is derived from power harvesting can significantly extend the network lifetime. Consequently, the network can work unattended for long periods. However, WSNs are characterized by multi-hop lossy links and resource constrained nodes while they have to face the coexistence problem with other applications. Opportunistic Routing (OR) is a routing paradigm to improve network performance in lossy wireless networks. At the same time, Cognitive Radio (CR) technology enables unlicensed operation in licensed bands. In this work, a combination of these two research approaches in a novel routing protocol is presented. A Spectrum and Energy Aware Opportunistic Routing (SEA-OR) protocol is proposed and designed for Self-powered WSNs. Moreover, a prioritization scheme which balances the packet advancement, the residual energy and the link reliability is introduced. Preliminary results show an improvement in network lifetime and delivery ratio. The performance of the introduced protocol is also evaluated in prototypes.

Poster: detecting client mobility in WLANs using PHY layer information
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
The continuously increasing number of smartphones and tablets allow the users to access Wireless LANs (WLANs) while undergoing different types of mobility, posing new challenges to wireless protocols. Current history-based WLAN protocols do not work well in mobile settings where wireless conditions change rapidly. Thus, today's WLANs need to be able to determine the type of the client's mobility and employ appropriate strategies in order to sustain high performance. While previous work tried to detect mobility using hints from sensors available in mobile devices, in this work, we demonstrate how different mobility modes can be distinguished by using physical layer information - Channel State Information (CSI) and Time-of-Flight (ToF) - available at commodity APs, with no modifications on the client side. Our testbed experiments show that our mobility classification algorithm achieves more than 92% accuracy in a variety of scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate how fine-grained mobility determination can be exploited to greatly improve performance of client roaming and MIMO beamforming.

SaveAlert is an adaptive framework for crowd-monitoring and danger-detection using off-the-shelf smartphones and other peripherals such as smartwatches. It is a system that provides users with an increased awareness of their surroundings by detecting and notifying them of impending danger, by relying only on sensor data collected from the users. Our framework's novelty is in how it performs efficient sensor data collection from potentially a large number of people by limiting the disturbance and stress on the existing Wi-Fi and cellular infrastructure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first crowd-monitoring framework that takes advantage of peer-to-peer connections to perform local aggregation to alleviate the stress on existing infrastructures for better scalability and efficiency.

This poster introduces MoveLoc, a system that locates a moving object without carrying any devices from detecting Doppler shifts reflected off the moving object. It works even if the object walking or running in different directions without any training. MoveLoc does not require the user to carry any communication devices, yet its accuracy exceeds current moving object localization systems using Radio Signal Strength(RSS). We implement the system and evaluate the performance on moving person by experiments.

Luxapose: indoor positioning with mobile phones and visible light
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires. The luminaires-modified to allow rapid, on-off keying-transmit their identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical pulses. A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image, decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires. Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position updates. The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be solved with optimization techniques. We explore the feasibility of the design through an analytical model, demonstrate the viability of the design through a prototype system, discuss the challenges to a practical deployment including usability and scalability, and demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in both carefully controlled and more realistic human mobility scenarios.

Experiencing and handling the diversity in data density and environmental locality in an indoor positioning service
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Diversity in training data density and environment locality is intrinsic in the real-world deployment of indoor localization systems and has a major impact on the performance of existing localization approaches. In this paper, through micro-benchmarks, we find that fingerprint-based approaches are preferable in scenarios where a dense database is available; while model-based approaches are the method of choice in the case of sparse data. It should be noted, however, that practical situations are complex. A single deployment often features both sparse and dense sampled areas. Furthermore, the internal layout affects the propagation of radio signals and exhibits environmental impacts. A certain number of measurement samples may be sufficient for one part of the building, but entirely insufficient for another. Thus, finding the right indoor localization algorithm for a given large-scale deployment is challenging, if not impossible; there is no one-size-fits-all indoor localization approach. Realizing the fundamental fact that the quality of the location database capturing the actual radio map dictates localization accuracy, in this paper, we propose Modellet, an algorithmic approach that optimally approximates the actual radio map by unifying model-based and fingerprint-based approaches. Modellet represents the radio map using a fingerprint-cloud that incorporates both measured real fingerprints and virtual fingerprints, which are computed from models with a local support, based on the key concept of the supporting set. We evaluate Modellet with data collected from an office building as well as 13 large-scale deployment venues (shopping malls and airports), located across China, U.S., and Germany. Comparing Modellet with two representative baseline approaches, RADAR and EZPerfect, demonstrates that Modellet effectively adapts to different data densities and environmental conditions, substantially outperforming existing approaches.

Travi-Navi: self-deployable indoor navigation system
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
We present Travi-Navi - a vision-guided navigation system that enables a self-motivated user to easily bootstrap and deploy indoor navigation services, without comprehensive indoor localization systems or even the availability of floor maps. Travi-Navi records high quality images during the course of a guider's walk on the navigation paths, collects a rich set of sensor readings, and packs them into a navigation trace. The followers track the navigation trace, get prompt visual instructions and image tips, and receive alerts when they deviate from the correct paths. Travi-Navi also finds the most efficient shortcuts whenever possible. We encounter and solve several challenges, including robust tracking, shortcut identification, and high quality image capture while walking. We implement Travi-Navi and conduct extensive experiments. The evaluation results show that Travi-Navi can track and navigate users with timely instructions, typically within a 4-step offset, and detect deviation events within 9 steps.

Accurate indoor localization with zero start-up cost
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Recent years have seen the advent of new RF-localization systems that demonstrate tens of centimeters of accuracy. However, such systems require either deployment of new infrastructure, or extensive fingerprinting of the environment through training or crowdsourcing, impeding their wide-scale adoption. We present Ubicarse, an accurate indoor localization system for commodity mobile devices, with no specialized infrastructure or fingerprinting. Ubicarse enables handheld devices to emulate large antenna arrays using a new formulation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Past work on SAR requires measuring mechanically controlled device movement with millimeter precision, far beyond what commercial accelerometers can provide. In contrast, Ubicarse's core contribution is the ability to perform SAR on handheld devices twisted by their users along unknown paths. Ubicarse is not limited to localizing RF devices; it combines RF localization with stereo-vision algorithms to localize common objects with no RF source attached to them. We implement Ubicarse on a HP SplitX2 tablet and empirically demonstrate a median error of 39 cm in 3-D device localization and 17 cm in object geotagging in complex indoor settings.

Magnetic MIMO: how to charge your phone in your pocket
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking

2014
This paper bridges wireless communication with wireless power transfer. It shows that mobile phones can be charged remotely, while in the user's pocket by applying the concept of MIMO beamforming. However, unlike MIMO beamforming in communication systems which targets the radiated field, we transfer power by beamforming the non-radiated magnetic field and steering it toward the phone. We design MagMIMO, a new system for wireless charging of cell phones and portable devices. MagMIMO consumes as much power as existing solutions, yet it can charge a phone remotely without being removed from the user's pocket. Furthermore, the phone need not face the charging pad, and can charge independently of its orientation. We have built MagMIMO and demonstrated its ability to charge the iPhone and other smart phones, while in the user's pocket.

Itus: an implicit authentication framework for android
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Security and usability issues with pass-locks on mobile devices have prompted researchers to develop implicit authentication (IA) schemes, which continuously and transparently authenticate users using behavioural biometrics. Contemporary IA schemes proposed by the research community are challenging to deploy, and there is a need for a framework that supports: different behavioural classifiers, given that different apps have different requirements; app developers using IA without becoming domain experts; and real-time classification on resource-constrained mobile devices. We present Itus, an IA framework for Android that allows the research community to improve IA schemes incrementally, while allowing app developers to adopt these improvements at their own pace. We describe the Itus framework and how it provides: ease of use: Itus allows app developers to use IA by changing as few as two lines of their existing code - on the other hand, Itus provides an oracle capable of making advanced recommendations should developers wish to fine-tune the classifiers; flexibility: developers can deploy Itus in an application-specific manner, adapting to their unique needs; extensibility: researchers can contribute new behavioural features and classifiers without worrying about deployment particulars; low performance overhead: Itus operates with minimal performance overhead, allowing app developers to deploy it without compromising end-user experience. These goals are accomplished with an API allowing individual stakeholders to incrementally improve Itus without re-engineering new systems. We implement Itus in two demo apps and measure its performance impact. To our knowledge, Itus is the first open-source extensible IA framework for Android that can be deployed off-the-shelf.

Scalable and comprehensive testing of mobile apps is extremely challenging. Every test input needs to be run with a variety of contexts, such as: device heterogeneity, wireless network speeds, locations, and unpredictable sensor inputs. The range of values for each context, e.g. location, can be very large. In this paper we present Caiipa, a cloud service for testing apps over an expanded mobile context space in a scalable way. It incorporates key techniques to make app testing more tractable, including a context test space prioritizer to quickly discover failure scenarios for each app. We have implemented Caiipa on a cluster of VMs and real devices that can each emulate various combinations of contexts for tablet and phone apps. We evaluate Caiipa by testing 265 commercially available mobile apps based on a comprehensive library of real-world conditions. Our results show that Caiipa leads to improvements of 11.1x and 8.4x in the number of crashes and performance bugs discovered compared to conventional UI-based automation (i.e., monkey-testing).

Rethink energy accounting with cooperative game theory
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Energy accounting determines how much a software principal contributes to the total system energy consumption. It is the foundation for evaluating software and for operating system based energy management. While various energy accounting policies have been tried, there is no known way to evaluate them directly simply because it is hard to track all hardware usage by software in a heterogeneous multicore system like modern smartphones and tablets. In this work, we argue that energy accounting should be formulated as a cooperative game and that the Shapley value provides the ultimate ground truth for energy accounting policies. We reveal the important flaws of existing energy accounting policies based on the Shapley value theory and provide Shapley value-based energy accounting, a practical approximation of the Shapley value, for battery-powered mobile systems. We evaluate this approximation against existing energy accounting policies in two ways: (i) how well they identify the top energy consuming applications, and (ii) how effective they are in system energy management. Using a prototype based on Texas Instruments Pandaboard and smartphone workload, we experimentally demonstrate existing energy accounting policies can deviate by 400% in attributing energy consumption to running applications and can be up to 25% less effective in system energy management when compared to Shapley value-based energy accounting.

Robust network compressive sensing
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Networks are constantly generating an enormous amount of rich diverse information. Such information creates exciting opportunities for network analytics. However, a major challenge to enable effective network analytics is the presence of missing data, measurement errors, and anomalies. Despite significant work in network analytics, fundamental issues remain: (i) the existing works do not explicitly account for anomalies or measurement noise, and incur serious performance degradation under significant noise or anomalies, and (ii) they assume network matrices have low-rank structure, which may not hold in reality. To address these issues, in this paper we develop LENS decomposition, a novel technique to accurately decompose a network matrix into a low-rank matrix, a sparse anomaly matrix, an error matrix, and a small noise matrix. LENS has the following nice properties: (i) it is general: it can effectively support matrices with or without anomalies, and having low-rank or not, (ii) its parameters are self tuned so that it can adapt to different types of data, (iii) it is accurate by incorporating domain knowledge, such as temporal locality, spatial locality, and initial estimate (e.g., obtained from models), (iv) it is versatile and can support many applications including missing value interpolation, prediction, and anomaly detection. We apply LENS to a wide range of network matrices from 3G, WiFi, mesh, sensor networks, and the Internet. Our results show that LENS significantly out-performs state-of-the-art compressive sensing schemes.

EkhoNet: high speed ultra low-power backscatter for next generation sensors
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
This paper argues for a clean-slate redesign of wireless sensor systems to take advantage of the extremely low power consumption of backscatter communication and emerging ultra-low power sensor modalities. We make the case that existing sensing architectures incur substantial overhead for a variety of computational blocks between the sensor and RF front end - while these overheads were negligible on platforms where communication was expensive, they become the bottleneck on backscatter-based systems and increase power consumption while limiting throughput. We present a radically new design that is minimalist, yet efficient, and designed to operate end-to-end at tens of &#956;Ws while enabling high-data rate backscatter at rates upwards of many hundreds of Kbps. In addition, we demonstrate a complex reader-driven MAC layer that jointly considers energy, channel conditions, data utility, and platform constraints to enable network-wide throughput optimizations. We instantiate this architecture on a custom FPGA-based platform connected to microphones, and show that the platform consumes 73x lower power and has 12.5x higher throughput than existing backscatter-based sensing platforms.

2014
The work in this paper is a systematic research and engineering effort in exploring the design space of multi-interface wireless repeater systems. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a wireless repeater system, Multifacet, which opportunistically utilizes multiple interfaces to enhance capacity. The system is designed to be transparent to application endpoints and does not need any end application modifications for adoption. Multifacet incorporates several techniques to achieve efficient bandwidth utilization across multiple interfaces -- (a) coordinated channel sharing, (b) a simplified backpressure based striping technique, (c) a single link abstraction, and (d) the ability to seamlessly migrate a client to the optimal channel. Multifacet is implemented on off-the-shelf dual band wireless repeater and demonstrates high speeds (337 Mbps) operation. On average, Multifacet performs 50% better than traditional AP/repeater setups, and in the best case, more than 2x better.

Today's network control and management traffic are limited by their reliance on existing data networks. Fate sharing in this context is highly undesirable, since control traffic has very different availability and traffic delivery requirements. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of building a dedicated wireless facilities network for data centers. We propose Angora, a low-latency facilities network using low-cost, 60GHz beamforming radios that provides robust paths decoupled from the wired network, and flexibility to adapt to workloads and network dynamics. We describe our solutions to address challenges in link coordination, link interference and network failures. Our testbed measurements and simulation results show that Angora enables large number of low-latency control paths to run concurrently, while providing low latency end-to-end message delivery with high tolerance for radio and rack failures.

Recent literature advances Wi-Fi signals to "see" people's motions and locations. This paper asks the following question: Can Wi-Fi "hear" our talks? We present WiHear, which enables Wi-Fi signals to "hear" our talks without deploying any devices. To achieve this, WiHear needs to detect and analyze fine-grained radio reflections from mouth movements. WiHear solves this micro-movement detection problem by introducing Mouth Motion Profile that leverages partial multipath effects and wavelet packet transformation. Since Wi-Fi signals do not require line-of-sight, WiHear can "hear" people talks within the radio range. Further, WiHear can simultaneously "hear" multiple people's talks leveraging MIMO technology. We implement WiHear on both USRP N210 platform and commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure. Results show that within our pre-defined vocabulary, WiHear can achieve detection accuracy of 91% on average for single individual speaking no more than 6 words and up to 74% for no more than 3 people talking simultaneously. Moreover, the detection accuracy can be further improved by deploying multiple receivers from different angles.

The phone attitude is an essential input to many smartphone applications, which has been known very difficult to accurately estimate especially over long time.

A3 primarily leverages the gyroscope, but intelligently incorporates the accelerometer and magnetometer to select the best sensing capabilities and derive the most accurate attitude estimation. Extensive experimental evaluation on various types of Android smartphones confirms the outstanding performance of A3. Compared with other existing solutions, A3 provides 3x improvement on the accuracy of attitude estimation.

E-eyes: device-free location-oriented activity identification using fine-grained WiFi signatures
Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking
None
2014
Activity monitoring in home environments has become increasingly important and has the potential to support a broad array of applications including elder care, well-being management, and latchkey child safety. Traditional approaches involve wearable sensors and specialized hardware installations. This paper presents device-free location-oriented activity identification at home through the use of existing WiFi access points and WiFi devices (e.g., desktops, thermostats, refrigerators, smartTVs, laptops). Our low-cost system takes advantage of the ever more complex web of WiFi links between such devices and the increasingly fine-grained channel state information that can be extracted from such links. It examines channel features and can uniquely identify both in-place activities and walking movements across a home by comparing them against signal profiles. Signal profiles construction can be semi-supervised and the profiles can be adaptively updated to accommodate the movement of the mobile devices and day-to-day signal calibration. Our experimental evaluation in two apartments of different size demonstrates that our approach can achieve over 96% average true positive rate and less than 1% average false positive rate to distinguish a set of in-place and walking activities with only a single WiFi access point. Our prototype also shows that our system can work with wider signal band (802.11ac) with even higher accuracy.

Rethinking Energy-Performance Trade-Off in Mobile Web Page Loading

Web browsing is a key application on mobile devices. However, mobile browsers are largely optimized for performance, imposing a significant burden on power-hungry mobile devices. In this work, we aim to reduce the energy consumed to load web pages on smartphones, preferably without increasing page load time and compromising user experience. To this end, we first study the internals of web page loading on smartphones and identify its energy-inefficient behaviors. Based on our findings, we then derive general design principles for energy-efficient web page loading, and apply these principles to the open-source Chromium browser and implement our techniques on commercial smartphones. Experimental results show that our techniques are able to achieve a 24.4% average system energy saving for Chromium on a latest-generation big.LITTLE smartphone using WiFi (a 22.5% saving when using 3G), while not increasing average page load time. We also show that our proposed techniques can bring a 10.5% system energy saving on average with a small 1.69\% increase in page load time for mobile Firefox web browser. User study results indicate that such a small increase in page load time is hardly perceivable.

Optimizing Smartphone Power Consumption through Dynamic Resolution Scaling
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
The extremely-high display density of modern smartphones imposes a significant burden on power consumption, yet does not always provide an improved user experience and may even lead to a compromised user experience. As human visually-perceivable ability highly depends on the user-screen distance, a reduced display resolution may still achieve the same user experience when the user-screen distance is large. This provides new power-saving opportunities. In this paper, we present a flexible dynamic resolution scaling system for smartphones. The system adopts an ultrasonic-based approach to accurately detect the user-screen distance at low-power cost and makes scaling decisions automatically for maximum user experience and power saving. App developers or users can also adjust the resolution manually as their needs. Our system is able to work on existing commercial smartphones and support legacy apps, without requiring re-building the ROM or any changes of apps. An end-to-end dynamic resolution scaling system is implemented on the Galaxy S5 LTE-A and Nexus 6 smartphones, and the correctness and effectiveness are evaluated against 30 games and benchmarks. Experimental results show that all the 30 apps can run successfully with per-frame, real-time dynamic resolution scaling. The energy per frame can be reduced by 30.1% on average and up to 60.5\% at most when the resolution is halved, for 15 apps. A user study with 10 users indicates that our system remains good user experience, as none of the 10 users could perceive the resolution changes in the user study.

Smartphone Background Activities in the Wild: Origin, Energy Drain, and Optimization
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
As new iterations of more powerful and better connected smartphones emerge, their limited battery life remains a leading factor adversely affecting the mobile experience of millions of smartphone users. While it is well-known that many apps can drain battery even while running in background, there has not been any study that quantifies the extent and severity of such background energy drain for users in the wild. To extend battery life, various new features are being incorporated within the phone, one of them being preventing applications from running in background, i.e., when the screen is off, but their impact is largely unknown. This paper makes several contributions. First, we present a large-scale measurement study that performs an in-depth analysis of the activities of various apps running in background on thousands of phones in the wild. Second, we quantify the amount of battery drain by all such background activities and possible energy saving. Third, we develop a metric to measure the usefulness of background activities that is personalized to each user. Finally, we present a system called HUSH (screen-off optimizer) that monitors the metric online and automatically identifies and suppresses background activities during screen-off periods that are not useful to the user experience. In doing so, our proposed HUSH saves screen-off energy of smartphones by 15.7% on average while incurring minimal impact on the user experience with the apps.

Precise Power Delay Profiling with Commodity WiFi
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Power delay profiles characterize multipath channel features, which are widely used in motion- or localization-based applications. Recent studies show that the power delay profile may be derived from the CSI traces collected from commodity WiFi devices, but the performance is limited by two dominating factors. The resolution of the derived power delay profile is determined by the channel bandwidth, which is however limited on commodity WiFi. The collected CSI reflects the signal distortions due to both the channel attenuation and the hardware imperfection. A direct derivation of power delay profiles using raw CSI measures, as has been done in the literature, results in significant inaccuracy. In this paper, we present Splicer, a software-based system that derives high-resolution power delay profiles by splicing the CSI measurements from multiple WiFi frequency bands. We propose a set of key techniques to separate the mixed hardware errors from the collected CSI measurements. Splicer adapts its computations within stringent channel coherence time and thus can perform well in presence of mobility. Our experiments with commodity WiFi NICs show that Splicer substantially improves the accuracy in profiling multipath characteristics, reducing the errors of multipath distance estimation to be less than $2m$. Splicer can immediately benefit upper-layer applications. Our case study with recent single-AP localization achieves a median localization error of $0.95m$.

Understanding and Modeling of WiFi Signal Based Human Activity Recognition
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Some pioneer WiFi signal based human activity recognition systems have been proposed. Their key limitation lies in the lack of a model that can quantitatively correlate CSI dynamics and human activities. In this paper, we propose CARM, a CSI based human Activity Recognition and Monitoring system. CARM has two theoretical underpinnings: a CSI-speed model, which quantifies the correlation between CSI value dynamics and human movement speeds, and a CSI-activity model, which quantifies the correlation between the movement speeds of different human body parts and a specific human activity. By these two models, we quantitatively build the correlation between CSI value dynamics and a specific human activity. CARM uses this correlation as the profiling mechanism and recognizes a given activity by matching it to the best-fit profile. We implemented CARM using commercial WiFi devices and evaluated it in several different environments. Our results show that CARM achieves an average accuracy of greater than 96%.

WiDraw: Enabling Hands-free Drawing in the Air on Commodity WiFi Devices
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
This paper demonstrates that it is possible to leverage WiFi signals from commodity mobile devices to enable hands-free drawing in the air. While prior solutions require the user to hold a wireless transmitter, or require custom wireless hardware, or can only determine a pre-defined set of hand gestures, this paper introduces WiDraw, the first hand motion tracking system using commodity WiFi cards, and without any user wearables. WiDraw harnesses the Angle-of-Arrival values of incoming wireless signals at the mobile device to track the user's hand trajectory. We utilize the intuition that whenever the user's hand occludes a signal coming from a certain direction, the signal strength of the angle representing the same direction will experience a drop. Our software prototype using commodity wireless cards can track the user's hand with a median error lower than 5 cm. We use WiDraw to implement an in-air handwriting application that allows the user to draw letters, words, and sentences, and achieves a mean word recognition accuracy of 91%.

Keystroke Recognition Using WiFi Signals
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Keystroke privacy is critical for ensuring the security of computer systems and the privacy of human users as what being typed could be passwords or privacy sensitive information. In this paper, we show for the first time that WiFi signals can also be exploited to recognize keystrokes. The intuition is that while typing a certain key, the hands and fingers of a user move in a unique formation and direction and thus generate a unique pattern in the time-series of Channel State Information (CSI) values, which we call CSI-waveform for that key. In this paper, we propose a WiFi signal based keystroke recognition system called WiKey. WiKey consists of two Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) WiFi devices, a sender (such as a router) and a receiver (such as a laptop). The sender continuously emits signals and the receiver continuously receives signals. When a human subject types on a keyboard, WiKey recognizes the typed keys based on how the CSI values at the WiFi signal receiver end. We implemented the WiKey system using a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND WiFi router and a Lenovo X200 laptop. WiKey achieves more than 97.5\% detection rate for detecting the keystroke and 96.4% recognition accuracy for classifying single keys. In real-world experiments, WiKey can recognize keystrokes in a continuously typed sentence with an accuracy of 93.5%.

Reusing 60GHz Radios for Mobile Radar Imaging
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
The future of mobile computing involves autonomous drones, robots and vehicles. To accurately sense their surroundings in a variety of scenarios, these mobile computers require a robust environmental mapping system. One attractive approach is to reuse millimeterwave communication hardware in these devices, e.g. 60GHz networking chipset, and capture signals reflected by the target surface. The devices can also move while collecting reflection signals, creating a large synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for high-precision RF imaging. Our experimental measurements, however, show that this approach provides poor precision in practice, as imaging results are highly sensitive to device positioning errors that translate into phase errors. We address this challenge by proposing a new 60GHz imaging algorithm, {\em RSS Series Analysis}, which images an object using only RSS measurements recorded along the device's trajectory. In addition to object location, our algorithm can discover a rich set of object surface properties at high precision, including object surface orientation, curvature, boundaries, and surface material. We tested our system on a variety of common household objects (between 5cm--30cm in width). Results show that it achieves high accuracy (cm level) in a variety of dimensions, and is highly robust against noises in device position and trajectory tracking. We believe that this is the first practical mobile imaging system (re)using 60GHz networking devices, and provides a basic primitive towards the construction of detailed environmental mapping systems.

mTrack: High-Precision Passive Tracking Using Millimeter Wave Radios
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Radio-based passive-object sensing can enable a new form of pervasive user-computer interface. Prior work has employed various wireless signal features to sense objects under a set of predefined, coarse motion patterns. But an operational UI, like a trackpad, often needs to identify fine-grained, arbitrary motion. This paper explores the feasibility of tracking a passive writing object (e.g., pen) at sub-centimeter precision. We approach this goal through a practical design, mTrack, which uses highly-directional 60 GHz millimeter-wave radios as key enabling technology. mTrack runs a discrete beam scanning mechanism to pinpoint the object's initial location, and tracks its trajectory using a signal-phase based model. In addition, mTrack incorporates novel mechanisms to suppress interference from background reflections, taking advantage of the short wavelength of 60 GHz signals. We prototype mTrack and evaluate its performance on a 60 GHz reconfigurable radio platform. Experimental results demonstrate that mTrack can locate/track a pen with 90-percentile error below 8 mm, enabling new applications such as wireless transcription and virtual trackpad.

Acoustic Eavesdropping through Wireless Vibrometry
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Loudspeakers are widely used in conferencing and infotainment systems. Private information leakage from loudspeaker sound is often assumed to be preventable using sound-proof isolators like walls. In this paper, we explore a new acoustic eavesdropping attack that can subvert such protectors using radio devices. Our basic idea lies in an acoustic-radio transformation (ART) algorithm, which recovers loudspeaker sound by inspecting the subtle disturbance it causes to the radio signals generated by an adversary or by its co-located WiFi transmitter. ART builds on a modeling framework that distills key factors to determine the recovered audio quality. It incorporates diversity mechanisms and noise suppression algorithms that can boost the eavesdropping quality. We implement the ART eavesdropper on a software-radio platform and conduct experiments to verify its feasibility and threat level. When targeted at vanilla PC or smartphone loudspeakers, the attacker can successfully recover high-quality audio even when blocked by sound-proof walls. On the other hand, we propose several pragmatic countermeasures that can effectively reduce the attacker's audio recovery quality by orders of magnitude.

Snooping Keystrokes with mm-level Audio Ranging on a Single Phone
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
This paper explores the limits of audio ranging on mobile devices in the context of a keystroke snooping scenario. Acoustic keystroke snooping is challenging because it requires distinguishing and labeling sounds generated by tens of keys in very close proximity. Existing work on acoustic keystroke recognition relies on training with labeled data, linguistic context, or multiple phones placed around a keyboard --- requirements that limit usefulness in an adversarial context. In this work, we show that mobile audio hardware advances can be exploited to discriminate mm-level position differences and that this makes it feasible to locate the origin of keystrokes from only a single phone behind the keyboard. The technique clusters keystrokes using time-difference of arrival measurements as well as acoustic features to identify multiple strokes of the same key. It then computes the origin of these sounds precise enough to identify and label each key. By locating keystrokes this technique avoids the need for labeled training data or linguistic context. Experiments with three types of keyboards and off-the-shelf smartphones demonstrate scenarios where our system can recover $94\%$ of keystrokes, which to our knowledge, is the first single-device technique that enables acoustic snooping of passwords.

MoLe: Motion Leaks through Smartwatch Sensors
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Imagine a user typing on a laptop keyboard while wearing a smart watch. This paper asks whether motion sensors from the watch can leak information about what the user is typing. While its not surprising that some information will be leaked, the question is how much? We find that when motion signal processing is combined with patterns in English language, the leakage is substantial. Reported results show that when a user types a word $W$, it is possible to shortlist a median of 24 words, such that $W$ is in this shortlist. When the word is longer than $6$ characters, the median shortlist drops to $10$. Of course, such leaks happen without requiring any training from the user, and also under the (obvious) condition that the watch is only on the left hand. We believe this is surprising and merits awareness, especially in light of various continuous sensing apps that are emerging in the app market. Moreover, we discover additional "leaks" that can further reduce the shortlist -- we leave these exploitations to future work.

Demo: Platform for Collecting Data From Urban Sensors Using Vehicular Networking
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
A large-scale urban sensing platform, composed of multiple Data Collection Units (DCUs) equipped with sensor hardware scattered accross the city, allows pervasive monitoring of environmental parameters. Gathering sensor data from a number of disparate locations at a backend server can be supported by delay-tolerant services provided by existing vehicular networks. Our real-world sensing platform takes advantage of an existing vehicular network with more than 400 vehicles equipped with On-Board Units (OBUs). A purposely-developed implementation of a delay tolerant service is installed in all elements involved in the communication flow, from DCUs to the backend server. In this demo, we showcase the full end-to-end data flow with the actual equipment being used in our real-world deployment. Data produced at a DCU is collected by an OBU installed in a vehicle and delivered to a Road-Side Unit (RSU), which then forwards the data to the backend server.

Demo: AntMonitor: A System for Mobile Traffic Monitoring and Real-Time Prevention of Privacy Leaks
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2015
Mobile devices play an essential role in the Internet today, and there is an increasing interest in using them as a vantage point for network measurement from the edge. At the same time, these devices store personal, sensitive information, and there is a growing number of applications that leak it. We propose AntMonitor-- the first system of its kind that supports (i) collection of large-scale, semantic-rich network traffic in a way that respects users' privacy preferences and (ii) detection and prevention of leakage of private information in real time. The first property makes AntMonitor a powerful tool for network researchers who want to collect and analyze large-scale yet fine-grained mobile measurements. The second property can work as an incentive for using AntMonitor and contributing data for analysis. As a proof-of-concept, we have developed a prototype of AntMonitor, deployed it to monitor 9 users for 2 months, and collected and analyzed 20 GB of mobile data from 151 applications. Preliminary results show that fine-grained data collected from AntMonitor could enable application classification with higher accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we demonstrated that AntMonitor could help prevent several apps from leaking private information over unencrypted traffic, including phone numbers, emails, and device identifiers.

Thanks to an improved scanning algorithm and numerous optimizations to the connection setup, Car-Fi makes downloading large amounts of data from a moving car feasible.

Built around a cost-effective embedded Linux platform, OpenVLC is an open source project (www.openvlc.org) for research in Visible Light Communication (VLC) Networks. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate the OpenVLC1.0 platform, a flexible, software-defined, and low-cost research platform. OpenVLC1.0 consists of a simple electronic design, and a new driver of the Linux operating system that implements the MAC, part of the PHY layers and it offers an interface to Internet protocols. The electronics of OpenVLC implement a flexible optical front-end consisting of commodity low- and high-power Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), photodiodes (PDs), and ancillary electronic circuitry. In order to quickly start playing with VLC Networks, we have designed and developed a printed circuit board (OpenVLC1.0 cape). The cape can be plugged into the main embedded Beaglebone board. Researchers can then swiftly build PHY and MAC protocols using the software implementation (OpenVLC1.0 driver), and prototype innovative solutions in realistic network setups. In this demo, we show that OpenVLC1.0 can switch between different MAC protocols, it can choose different optical channel for data transmission and reception, and it can be employed jointly with standard TCP/IP diagnostic tools.

Demo: Optimizing Smartphone Power Consumption through Dynamic Resolution Scaling
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
The extremely-high display density of modern smartphones imposes a significant burden on power consumption, yet does not always provide an improved user experience and may even lead to a compromised user experience. As human visually-perceivable ability highly depends on the user-screen distance, a reduced display resolution may still achieve the same user experience when the user-screen distance is large. This provides new power-saving opportunities. We present a flexible dynamic resolution scaling system for smartphones. The system adopts an ultrasonic-based approach to detect the user-screen distance at low-power cost and makes scaling decisions automatically for maximum user experience and power saving. App developers or users can also adjust the resolution manually and dynamically as their needs. Our system is able to work on the existing commercial smartphones and support the legacy apps, without requiring re-building the ROM or any changes from apps.

Gathering the required measurements to produce accurate results for mobile communications and wireless networking protocols, technologies and applications, relies on the use of expensive experimental computer networking facilities. Until very recently, large-scale testbed facilities have existed in separate silos, each with its own authentication mechanisms and experiment support tools. There lacked a viable federation model that reconciled the challenges posed by how to provide a single entry point to access heterogeneous and distributed resources, and how to federate these resources that are under the control of multiple authorities. The OneLab experimental facility, which came online in 2014, realizes this model, making a set of world-class testbeds freely available to researchers through a unique credential for each user and a common set of tools. We allow users to deploy innovative experiments across our federated platforms that include the embedded object testbeds of FIT IoT-Lab, the cognitive radio testbed of FIT CorteXlab, the wireless testbeds of NITOS-Lab, and the internet overlay testbed PlanetLab Europe (PLE), which together provide thousands of nodes for experimentation. Also federated under OneLab are the FUSECO Playground, which includes cloud, M2M, SDN, and mobile broadband; w-iLab.t wireless facilities; and the Virtual Wall testbed of wired networks and applications. Our demo describes the resources offered by the OneLab platforms, and illustrates how any member of the MobiCom community can create an account and start using these platforms today to deploy experiments for mobile and wireless testing.

Time synchronization provides the basis for several applications in wireless sensor networks but the limited memory and computational power, and the use of low precision oscillators make the task of time synchronization non-trivial. In this demonstration, we present a novel time synchronization scheme that is based on time series analysis. To provide a general model for the practical behavior of low precision oscillators, autoregressive integrated moving average models are explored. Based on the analysis of experimental data, an autoregressive integrated model (ARI (1,1)) is derived. Unlike the resource hungry Kalman filter based formulations, the proposed scheme is resource efficient as it results in simple linear regression processing. Experiments are performed on real sensor devices including Zolertia and TelosB, where an accuracy below 1 clock tick 1 is achieved.

Software-defined radios (SDR) have the potential to bring major innovation in wireless networking design. However, their impact so far has been limited due to complex programming tools.

To illustrate its potential, we present the design of an LTE-like PHY layer in Ziria. We run it on the Sora SDR platform and demonstrate on a test-bed that it is able to operate in real-time.

Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2015
Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technique has been widely accepted as a crucial solution to mitigate the potential spectrum scarcity problem. As a key form of DSA, government is proposing to release more federal spectrum for sharing with commercial wireless users. However, the flourish of federal-commercial sharing hinges upon how privacy issues are managed. In current DSA proposals, the sensitive operation parameters of both federal incumbent users (IUs) and commercial secondary users (SUs) need to be shared with the dynamic spectrum access system (SAS) to realize efficient spectrum allocation. Since SAS is not necessarily operated by a trusted third party, the current proposals dissatisfy the privacy requirement of both IUs and SUs. To address the privacy issues, this paper presents a privacy-preserving SAS design, which realizes the complex spectrum allocation decision process of DSA through secure computation over ciphertext based on homomorphic encryption, thus none of the IU or SU operation parameters are exposed to SAS.

This poster introduces JRD, a novel device-free localization system which can achieve high accuracy with low cost and little human effort, and is even robust to different scenarios. Unlike the previous Radio Signal Strength (RSS)-based systems which depend on the dense deployment to provide high accuracy, JRD extracts the fine-grained RSS distributions of a single link and presents a voting algorithm based on multi-link to identify the object location accurately while maintaining a low-cost deployment. Furthermore, JRD is flexible to different scenarios by using the transferring technique with less time-consuming and human effort. Experimental results show that JRD can improve the localization accuracy by up to 50% with less cost as compared with the existing RSS approaches.

Modern cars are already able to park in parking spaces adjacent to streets. Soon autonomous cars will be able to navigate themselves through parking garages to find a parking lot assigned to them. Indoor localization is essential to qualify cars and parking garages to perform this operation.

We present a position estimation algorithm for indoor localization systems based on phase measurements of electromagnetic signals. Our algorithm is designed to detect and exclude measurements originating from these non-line-of-sight paths to reduce their harmful influence on the localization.

The co-existence of small cells and macro cells is a key feature of 4G and future networks. This heterogeneity, together with the increased mobility of user devices can generate a high handover frequency that could lead to unreasonably high call drop probability or poor user experience. By performing smart mobility management, the network can pro-actively adapt to the user and guarantee seamless and smooth cell transitions. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that takes as input sounding reference signal (SRS) measurements available at the base station (eNodeB in 4G systems) to estimate with a low computational requirement the mobility level of the user and with no modification at the user device/equipment (UE) side. The performance of the algorithm is showcased using realistic data and mobility traces. Results show that the classification of UE speed to three mobility classes can be achieved with accuracy of 87% for low mobility, 93% for medium mobility, and 94% for high mobility, respectively.

Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2015
Mobile web browsing is experienced slow because of the limited rendering capability of the mobile devices, wireless latency, and incremental rendering of the page or resource loading. The browser renders resources in between two consecutive resource downloads. However, during this period, the wireless interfaces consume energy doing nothing useful. In this work, we measure the performance of SPDY for mobile web browsing. We demonstrate that mobile devices waste energy by keeping the wireless network interface idle between consecutive resource downloads. We next show that by identifying the embedded resources in a web page and downloading those resources in parallel at the very beginning can reduce the small idle periods and thus energy consumption by 20-50%, depending on the wireless network type.

Minimizing the energy consumption of mobile devices for wireless network access is important. In this article, we analyze the energy efficiency of a new set of applications which use Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels for secure communication. First, we discuss the energy efficiency of a number of VPN applications from a large scale deployment of 500 K devices. We next measure the energy consumption of some of these applications with different use cases. Finally, we demonstrate that a VPN tunnel can be instrumented for enhanced energy efficiency with multimedia streaming applications. Our results indicate energy savings of 40% for this class of applications.

Poster: A Low Cost People Flow Monitoring System For Sensing The Potential Danger
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

For a long history, stampede is one of the high potential disaster when thousands of people gathered. Current monitoring systems, however, can only detect the presence of a small number of sparsely located targets, rather than to monitor the change of people flow where there are large number of dense crowd in the environment. This paper presents DanSen, a low-cost people flow monitoring system for sensing the potential danger using the existing wifi infrastructures. Inspired by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) theory, the designed DanSen calculates the correlations between the initial channel state information (CSI) data and all the history CSI data to monitor the changes of people flow and also estimates the sharpness of the changes. By doing so, DanSen can be utilised to perceive the potential danger. Real-world experimental results illustrate the advantage and effectiveness of DanSen.

Poster: Use your Senses: A Smooth Multipath TCP WiFi/Mobile Handover
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
The handover from WiFi to mobile networks is known to lead to TCP connection drops due to changing IP addresses. Multipath TCP (MPTCP), a recent TCP extension, enables a transparent mobile handover by combining subflows on multiple interfaces, such as WiFi and LTE, to one logical connection. MPTCP provides multiple handover modes, which differ in their energy consumption and the performance during the handover. The Full-MPTCP mode uses permanently both WiFi and the mobile network, which increases energy consumption. The Single-Path mode establishes the mobile network connection after the WiFi connection broke, which leads to a short performance degradation. In this paper, we argue that this trade-off is not necessary. We propose to use the available (sensor) information to forecast the mobile handover. This allows switching to the Full-MPTCP mode before the WiFi connection breaks, providing both low energy consumption and high performance during the handover. For a first experimental evaluation, we use a declining WiFi link quality to forecast a handover. Our real world measurements show that both low energy consumption and high performance during the handover are possible at the same time.

Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2015
The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to digitize the physical world, resulting in a digital representation of our proximate living space. The possibility of inferring privacy violating information from IoT data necessitates adequate security measures regarding data storage and communication. To address these privacy and security concerns, we introduce our system that stores IoT data securely in the Cloud database while still allowing query processing over the encrypted data. We enable this by encrypting IoT data with a set of cryptographic schemes such as order-preserving and partially homomorphic encryptions. To achieve this on resource-limited devices, our system relies on optimized algorithms that accelerate partial homomorphic and order-preserving encryptions by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Our early results show the feasibility of our system on low-power devices. We envision our system as an enabler of secure IoT applications.

We investigate the applicability of IEEE 802.11ac for entertainment low-latency show control systems (to orchestrate free-riding vehicles in a theme-park environment) by experimentally characterizing the indoor throughput and jitter performance of 802.11ac using statistical analysis. 802.11ac is the successor of 802.11n that provides higher throughput by incorporating wider channels, more spatial streams and denser modulation. We show that multiple linear regression provides valuable insight in the influence of 802.11ac's independent features and their combinations on performance, for various links and interference scenarios. Finally, we show that 802.11ac could be used for not only delivering high throughput for multimedia streaming but also supports applications requiring minimal jitter variance in the setup investigated.

2015
Many emerging mobile computing applications are continuous vision based. The primary challenge these applications face is computation partitioning between the phone and cloud. The indoor location information is one metadata that can help these applications in making this decision. In this extended-abstract, we propose a vision based scheme to uniquely fingerprint an environment which can in turn be used to identify user's location from the uploaded visual features. Our approach takes into account that the opportunity to identify location is fleeting and the phones are resource constrained -- therefore minimal yet sufficient computation needs to be performed to make the offloading decision. Our work aims to achieve near real-time performance while scaling to buildings of arbitrary sizes. The current work is in preliminary stages but holds promise for the future -- may apply to many applications in this area.

The performance of YouTube in cellular networks is crucial to network operators, who try to find a trade-off between cost-efficient handling of the huge traffic amounts and high perceived end-user Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper we present YoMoApp (YouTube Performance Monitoring Application), an Android application which passively monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) of YouTube adaptive video streaming on end-user smartphones. The monitored KPIs (i.e., player state/events, re-buffering, and video quality levels) can be used to analyze the QoE of mobile YouTube video sessions. YoMoApp is a valuable tool to assess the performance of cellular networks with respect to YouTube traffic, as well as to develop optimizations and QoE models for mobile HTTP adaptive streaming. We try YoMoApp through real subjective QoE lab tests showing that the tool is accurate to capture the experience of end-users watching YouTube on smartphones.

An unobtrusive and continuous estimation of breathing volume could play a vital role in health care, such as for critically ill patients, neonatal ventilation, post-operative monitoring, just to name a few. While radar-based estimation of breathing rate has been discussed in the literature, estimating breathing volume using wireless signal remains relatively intact. With the presence of patient body movement and posture changes, long-term monitoring of breathing volume at fine granularity is even more challenging. In this work, we propose for the first time an autonomous system that monitors a patient's breathing volume with high resolution. We discuss the key research components and challenges in realizing the system. We also present an initial system design encompassing a continuous wave radar, motion tracking and control system, and a set of methods to accurately derive breathing volume from the reflected signal and to address challenges caused by body movement and posture changes. Our implementation shows promising results in estimating breathing volume with fine granularity.

This paper presents DiVA, a new acoustic source localization scheme that uses an ad-hoc network of microphone sensor nodes to produce an accurate estimate of the source's location. DiVA uses pairwise comparisons of sound detection timestamps between local Voronoi neighbors to identify the node closest to the acoustic source and then estimates the source's location. The scheme improves on the state of the art by effectively dealing with anchor nodes' position error, time stamp measurement error and time synchronization error in real world conditions. Through simulation and experimental evaluations, DiVA is shown to be more robust than existing solutions under different error conditions.

Stimulating user participation is of paramount importance for mobile crowdsensing applications to obtain high-quality data. Although many incentive mechanisms have been designed, most of them ignore the dynamic arrivals and different sensing requirements of tasks. Thus, the existing mechanisms will fail when being applied to the realistic scenario where tasks are publicized dynamically and heterogeneous with different sensing requirements of locations, time durations and sensing times. In this work, we propose an auction-based truthful mechanism for realistic mobile crowdsensing. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our mechanism can satisfy the desired properties of truthfulness, individual rationality, computational efficiency with both low social cost and low total payment.

The rapid development of UAV technology has opened up numerous applications. Further, cooperating drones\footnote{In this paper, we refer to all types of UAVs as drones.} possess a great potential in various areas of applications. Yet, there has not been a platform for a fleet of drones. It is rather difficult to control multiple drones through a single ground control station. In fact, drones need to consistently exchange flight information to maintain the formation of the fleet and follow the commands given from the GCS. Thus, drones need a robust network established among the fleet to provide a fleet control. In this paper, we propose Net-Drone, a multi-drone platform for applications that require cooperation of multiple drones. Net-Drone is equipped with strong network functionalities to provide a control system for a fleet of drones. Through case studies conducted with a prototype implementation, the proposed system is demonstrated. Video of the conducted case study can be found in http://youtu.be/lFaWsEmiQvw.

We present a new visible light communication (VLC) primitive: VLC in the dark, where the communication sustains even when the LED light appears dark. We achieve the goal by reducing the duty cycle of the light source to an extremely low level (0.0019%) such that the illuminance is imperceptible to human eyes and yet can still be sensed by photodiodes to decode data. VLC in the dark consumes much lower energy than the conventional VLC links and thus is appealing for enabling VLC uplink or communication among Internet-of-Things devices with tight energy budget. We build a preliminary prototype to demonstrate its feasibility. Our current single link achieves 190.7 bps data rate with 46.8 microwatts power consumption at the LED.

Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2015
Line-of-Sight blockage by human body is a severe challenge to enable robust 60 GHz directional links. Beamsteering is one feasible solution to overcome this problem by electronically steering phased-array beam towards Non-Line-of-Sight. However, effectiveness of beamsteering depends on the link deployment and a lack of assessment of steering effectiveness may render the link completely blacked-out during human blockage. In this poster, we propose a new technique called BeamScope, that predicts best possible location for a randomly deployed link in an indoor environment without the need of any explicit war-driving. BeamScope first characterizes the environment exploiting measurement from the randomly deployed reference location and then predicts the performance in unobserved locations to suggest a possible re-deployment. The environment characterization is captured through a novel metric and prediction is achieved via how this metric is shared between the reference location and unobserved locations. Our preliminary results show promising accuracy of identifying the best possible alternate location for 60 GHz link to achieve a robust connection during human blockage.

In recent years, Wi-Fi has seen extraordinary growth; however, due to the cost, performance and security issues, many Wi-Fi hotspot owners would like to restrict the network access only to individuals inside the physical property. Unfortunately, due to the nature of wireless, this is difficult to accomplish, especially with the off-the-shelf omni-antenna devices. In this work, we develop and implement CLaWa, a Crowdsourced Location Aware Wi-Fi Access Control scheme to address this challenge. Our system is based on observations of differing characteristics of physical layer information across physical boundaries such as walls and corners. CLaWa crowdsources both channel state information (CSI) and received signal strength (RSS) of already validated users to classify future users. We have also selected an appropriate machine learning algorithm for CLaWa. Evaluation results show that CLaWa can identify the boundary around a given area precisely, thus granting network access only to users inside the area while not validating users outside the boundary. Compared to indoor localization schemes, CLaWa is a lightweight solution which does not require expensive localization operations.

Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2015
Intermittent connection of wireless links, caused by low duty-cycle radio operation, harsh working environment, movement of sensor nodes, etc., makes clock synchronization a challenging task. Prior synchronization approaches in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) typically require that nodes exchange time messages frequently with the reference clock, which is difficult in networks with low or intermittent connectivity. This poster presents RobSync, a robust design for clock synchronization in intermittent-connected wireless networks. Having recognized that clock skew is highly correlated to the voltage supply, we use the local voltage information as a reference for clock self-calibration, which helps reduce the frequency of time-stamp exchanges. To prevent a misuse of the voltage information, leading to error accumulation, a re-synchronization interval adjustment design is developed to make a trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption. We present the theory behind RobSync, and provide preliminary results by experiments to compare our approach and the recent approach.

Recitation: Rehearsing Wireless Packet Reception in Software
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
This paper presents Recitation, the first software system that uses lightweight channel state information (CSI) to accurately predict error-prone bit positions in a packet so that applications atop the wireless physical layer may take the best action during subsequent transmissions. Our key insight is that although Wi-Fi wireless physical layer operations are complex, they are deterministic. This enables us to rehearse physical-layer operations on packet bits before they are transmitted. Based on this rehearsal, we calculate a hidden parameter in the decoding process, called error event probability (EVP). EVP captures fine-grained information about the receiver's convolutional or LDPC decoder, allowing Recitation to derive precise information about the likely fate of every bit in subsequent packets, without any wireless channel training. Recitation is the first system of its kind that is both software-implementable and compatible with the existing 802.11 architecture for both SISO and MIMO settings. We experiment with commodity Atheros 9580 Wi-Fi NICs to demonstrate Recitation's utility with three representative applications in static, mobile, and interference-dominated scenarios. We show that Recitation achieves 33.8% and 16% average throughput gains for bit-rate adaptation and partial packet recovery, respectively, and 6 dB PSNR quality improvement for unequal error protection-based video.

Hekaton: Efficient and Practical Large-Scale MIMO
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Large-scale multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems have the potential for multi-fold scaling of network capacity. The research community has recognized this theoretical potential and developed architectures [1,2] with large numbers of RF chains. Unfortunately, building the hardware with a large number of RF chains is challenging in practice. CSI data transport and computational overhead of MU-MIMO beamforming can also become prohibitive under large network scale. Furthermore, it is difficult to physically append extra RF chains on existing communication equipments to support such large-scale MU-MIMO architectures. In this paper, we present Hekaton, a novel large-scale MU-MIMO framework that combines legacy MU-MIMO beamforming with phased-array antennas. The core of Hekaton is a two-level beamforming architecture. First, the phased-array antennas steer spatial beams toward each downlink user to reduce channel correlation and suppress the cross-talk interference in the RF domain (for beamforming gain), then we adopt legacy digital beamforming to eliminate the interference between downlink data streams (for spatial multiplexing gain). In this way, Hekaton realizes a good fraction of potential large-scale MU-MIMO gains even under the limited RF chain number on existing communication equipments. We evaluate the performance of Hekaton through over-the-air testbed built over the WARPv3 platform and trace-driven emulation. In the evaluations, Hekaton can improve single-cell throughput by up to 2.5X over conventional MU-MIMO with a single antenna per RF chain, while using the same transmit power.

This paper presents FreeBee, which enables direct unicast as well as cross-technology/channel broadcast among three popular wireless technologies: WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth. Our design aims to shed the light on the opportunities that cross-technology communication has to offer including, but not limited to, cross-technology cooperation and coordination. The key concept of FreeBee is to modulate symbol messages by shifting the timing of periodic beacon frames already mandatory for wireless standards without incurring extra traffic. Such a generic cross-technology design consumes zero additional bandwidth, allowing continuous broadcast to safely reach mobile and/or duty-cycled devices. A new \emph{interval multiplexing} technique is proposed to enable concurrent broadcasts from multiple senders or boost the transmission rate of a single sender. Theoretical and experimental exploration reveals that FreeBee offers a reliable symbol delivery under a second and supports mobility of 30mph and low duty-cycle operations of under 5%.

We present LiSense, the first-of-its-kind system that enables both data communication and fine-grained, real-time human skeleton reconstruction using Visible Light Communication (VLC). LiSense uses shadows created by the human body from blocked light and reconstructs 3D human skeleton postures in real time. We overcome two key challenges to realize shadow-based human sensing. First, multiple lights on the ceiling lead to diminished and complex shadow patterns on the floor. We design light beacons enabled by VLC to separate light rays from different light sources and recover the shadow pattern cast by each individual light. Second, we design an efficient inference algorithm to reconstruct user postures using 2D shadow information with a limited resolution collected by photodiodes embedded in the floor. We build a 3 m x 3 m LiSense testbed using off-the-shelf LEDs and photodiodes. Experiments show that LiSense reconstructs the 3D user skeleton at 60 Hz in real time with 10 degrees mean angular error for five body joints.

Mobile devices are shrinking their form factors for portability, but user-mobile interaction is becoming increasingly challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel system called Okuli to meet this challenge. Okuli is a compact, low-cost system that can augment a mobile device and extend its interaction workspace to any nearby surface area. Okuli piggybacks on visible light communication modules, and uses a low-power LED and two light sensors to locate user's finger within the workspace. It is built on a light propagation/reflection model that achieves around one-centimeter location precision, with zero run-time training overhead. We have prototyped Okuli as an Android peripheral, with a 3D-printed shroud to host the LED and light sensors. Our experiments demonstrate Okuli's accuracy, stability, energy efficiency, as well as its potential in serving virtual keyboard and trackpad applications.

This paper introduces EcoDrive, a fuel consumption sensing and control system for modern vehicles, implemented in an embedded platform, to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. EcoDrive senses vehicle dynamics through the standard vehicle On-board diagnostics (OBD) port and models various vehicle forces, i.e., propulsion, drivetrain loss, wind resistance and grade resistance, as functions of instant fuel consumption. By sensing vehicular speed and controlling air/fuel injection rate in real time, EcoDrive can adjust speed carefully to improve fuel efficiency. We have collected more than 10,000 miles of driving traces from 12 different vehicles to build models of vehicle dynamics. Based on the models, a prototype of EcoDrive is implemented in an off-the-shelf embedded platform. The prototype is installed on a regular vehicle and evaluated through test drives of more than 100 miles across both urban and highway environments. In comparison with human drivers, EcoDrive achieves an average of 20% higher fuel efficiency in urban road segments and 30% higher fuel efficiency on highways.

Recently a number of systems have been developed to implement and improve the visual communication over screen-camera links. In this paper we study an opposite problem: how to prevent unauthorized users from videotaping a video played on a screen, such as in a theater, while do not affect the viewing experience of legitimate audiences. We propose and develop a light-weight hardware-free system, called Kaleido, that ensures these properties by taking advantage of the limited disparities between the screen-eye channel and the screen-camera channel. Kaleido does not require any extra hardware and is purely based on re-encoding the original video frame into multiple frames used for displaying. We extensively test our system Kaleido using a variety of smartphone cameras. Our experiments confirm that Kaleido preserves the high-quality screen-eye channel while reducing the secondary screen-camera channel quality significantly.

CAreDroid: Adaptation Framework for Android Context-Aware Applications
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Context-awareness is the ability of software systems to sense and adapt to their physical environment. Many contemporary mobile applications adapt to changing locations, connectivity states, available computational and energy resources, and proximity to other users and devices. Nevertheless, there is little systematic support for context-awareness in contemporary mobile operating systems. Because of this, application developers must build their own context-awareness adaptation engines, dealing directly with sensors and polluting application code with complex adaptation decisions. In this paper, we introduce CAreDroid, which is a framework that is designed to decouple the application logic from the complex adaptation decisions in Android context-aware applications. In this framework, developers are required--only--to focus on the application logic by providing a list of methods that are sensitive to certain contexts along with the permissible operating ranges under those contexts. At run time, CAreDroid monitors the context of the physical environment and intercepts calls to sensitive methods, activating only the blocks of code that best fit the current physical context. CAreDroid is implemented as part of the Android runtime system. By pushing context monitoring and adaptation into the runtime system, CAreDroid eases the development of context-aware applications and increases their efficiency. In particular, case study applications implemented using CAreDroid are shown to have: (1) at least half lines of code fewer and (2) at least 10&#215; more efficient in execution time compared to equivalent context-aware applications that use only standard Android APIs.

CIDER: Enabling Robustness-Power Tradeoffs on a Computational Eyeglass
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
The human eye offers a fascinating window into an individual's health, cognitive attention, and decision making, but we lack the ability to continually measure these parameters in the natural environment. The challenges lie in: a) handling the complexity of continuous high-rate sensing from a camera and processing the image stream to estimate eye parameters, and b) dealing with the wide variability in illumination conditions in the natural environment. This paper explores the power--robustness tradeoffs inherent in the design of a wearable eye tracker, and proposes a novel staged architecture that enables graceful adaptation across the spectrum of real-world illumination. We propose CIDER, a system that operates in a highly optimized low-power mode under indoor settings by using a fast Search-Refine controller to track the eye, but detects when the environment switches to more challenging outdoor sunlight and switches models to operate robustly under this condition. Our design is holistic and tackles a) power consumption in digitizing pixels, estimating pupillary parameters, and illuminating the eye via near-infrared, b) error in estimating pupil center and pupil dilation, and c) model training procedures that involve zero effort from a user. We demonstrate that CIDER can estimate pupil center with error less than two pixels (0.6O), and pupil diameter with error of one pixel (0.22mm). Our end-to-end results show that we can operate at power levels of roughly 7mW at a 4Hz eye tracking rate, or roughly 32mW at rates upwards of 250Hz.

piStream: Physical Layer Informed Adaptive Video Streaming over LTE
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Adaptive HTTP video streaming over LTE has been gaining popularity due to LTE's high capacity. Quality of adaptive streaming depends highly on the accuracy of client's estimation of end-to-end network bandwidth, which is challenging due to LTE link dynamics. In this paper, we present piStream, that allows a client to efficiently monitor the LTE basestation's PHY-layer resource allocation, and then map such information to an estimation of available bandwidth. Given the PHY-informed bandwidth estimation, piStream uses a probabilistic algorithm to balance video quality and the risk of stalling, taking into account the burstiness of LTE downlink traffic loads. We conduct a real-time implementation of piStream on a software-radio tethered to an LTE smartphone. Comparison with state-of-the-art adaptive streaming protocols demonstrates that piStream can effectively utilize the LTE bandwidth, achieving high video quality with minimal stalling rate.

2015
Internet-enabled cameras pervade daily life, generating a huge amount of data, but most of the video they generate is transmitted over wires and analyzed offline with a human in the loop. The ubiquity of cameras limits the amount of video that can be sent to the cloud, especially on wireless networks where capacity is at a premium. In this paper, we present Vigil, a real-time distributed wireless surveillance system that leverages edge computing to support real-time tracking and surveillance in enterprise campuses, retail stores, and across smart cities. Vigil intelligently partitions video processing between edge computing nodes co-located with cameras and the cloud to save wireless capacity, which can then be dedicated to Wi-Fi hotspots, offsetting their cost. Novel video frame prioritization and traffic scheduling algorithms further optimize Vigil's bandwidth utilization. We have deployed Vigil across three sites in both whitespace and Wi-Fi networks. Depending on the level of activity in the scene, experimental results show that Vigil allows a video surveillance system to support a geographical area of coverage between five and 200 times greater than an approach that simply streams video over the wireless network. For a fixed region of coverage and bandwidth, Vigil outperforms the default equal throughput allocation strategy of Wi-Fi by delivering up to 25% more objects relevant to a user's query.

We present SAMPLES: Self Adaptive Mining of Persistent LExical Snippets; a systematic framework for classifying network traffic generated by mobile applications. SAMPLES constructs conjunctive rules, in an automated fashion, through a supervised methodology over a set of labeled flows (the training set). Each conjunctive rule corresponds to the lexical context, associated with an application identifier found in a snippet of the HTTP header, and is defined by: (a) the identifier type, (b) the HTTP header-field it occurs in, and (c) the prefix/suffix surrounding its occurrence. Subsequently, these conjunctive rules undergo an aggregate-and-validate step for improving accuracy and determining a priority order. The refined rule-set is then loaded into an application-identification engine where it operates at a per flow granularity, in an extract-and-lookup paradigm, to identify the application responsible for a given flow. Thus, SAMPLES can facilitate important network measurement and management tasks --- e.g. behavioral profiling [29], application-level firewalls [21,22] etc. --- which require a more detailed view of the underlying traffic than that afforded by traditional protocol/port based methods. We evaluate SAMPLES on a test set comprising 15 million flows (approx.) generated by over 700 K applications from the Android, iOS and Nokia market-places. SAMPLES successfully identifies over 90% of these applications with 99% accuracy on an average. This, in spite of the fact that fewer than 2% of the applications are required during the training phase, for each of the three market places. This is a testament to the universality and the scalability of our approach. We, therefore, expect SAMPLES to work with reasonable coverage and accuracy for other mobile platforms --- e.g. BlackBerry and Windows Mobile --- as well.

Performance Characterization and Call Reliability Diagnosis Support for Voice over LTE
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
To understand VoLTE performance in a commercial deployment, in this paper we conduct the first comprehensive performance characterization of commercially deployed VoLTE, and compare with legacy call and over-the-top (OTT) VoIP call. We confirm that VoLTE excels in most metrics such as audio quality, but its call reliability still lags behind legacy call for all the three major U.S. operators. We propose an on-device VoLTE problem detection tool, which can capture new types of problems concerning audio quality with high accuracy and minimum overhead, and perform stress testing on VoLTE call's reliability. We discover 3 instances of problems in the early deployment of VoLTE lying in the protocol design and implementation. Although the identified problems are all concerned with the immature LTE coverage in the current deployment, we find that they can cause serious impairment on user experience and are urgent to be solved in the developing stage. For example, one such instance can lead to up to 50-second-long muting problem during a VoLTE call! We perform in-depth cross-layer analysis and find that the causes are rooted in the lack of coordination among protocols designed for different purposes, and invalid assumptions made by protocols used in existing infrastructure when integrated with VoLTE. We summarize learnt lessons and suggest solutions.

ABSENCE: Usage-based Failure Detection in Mobile Networks
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
We present our proposed ABSENCE system which detects service disruptions in mobile networks using aggregated customer usage data. ABSENCE monitors aggregated customer usage to detect when aggregated usage is lower than expected in a given geographic region (e.g., zip code), across a given customer device type, or for a given service. Such a drop in expected usage is interpreted as a sign of a potential service disruption being experienced in that region/device type/service. ABSENCE effectively deals with users' mobility and scales to detect failures in various mobile services (e.g., voice, data, SMS, MMS, etc). We perform a systematic evaluation of our proposed approach by introducing synthetic failures in measurements obtained from a US operator. We also compare our results with ground truth (real service disruptions) obtained from the mobile operator.

Experience: Rethinking RRC State Machine Optimization in Light of Recent Advancements
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Broadband mobile networks utilize a radio resource control (RRC) state machine to allocate scarce radio resources. Current implementations introduce high latencies and cross-layer degradation. Recently, the RRC enhancements, continuous packet connectivity (CPC) and the enhanced forward access channel (Enhanced FACH), have emerged in UMTS. We study the availability and performance of these enhancements on a network serving a market with a population in the millions. Our experience in the wild shows these enhancements offer significant reductions in latency, mobile device energy consumption, and improved end user experience. We develop new over-the-air measurements that resolve existing limitations in measuring RRC parameters. We find CPC provides significant benefits with minimal resource costs, prompting us to rethink past optimization strategies. We examine the cross-layer performance of CPC and Enhanced FACH, concluding that CPC provides reductions in mobile device energy consumption for many applications. While the performance increase of HS-FACH is substantial, cross-layer performance is limited by the legacy uplink random access channel (RACH), and we conclude full support of Enhanced FACH is necessary to benefit most applications. Given that UMTS growth will exceed LTE for several more years and the greater worldwide deployment of UMTS, our quantitative results should be of great interest to network operators adding capacity to these networks. Finally, these results provide new insights for application developers wishing to optimize performance with these RRC enhancements.

See Through Walls with COTS RFID System!
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Through-wall tracking has gained a lot of attentions in civilian applications recently. Many applications would benefit from such device-free tracking, e.g. elderly people surveillance, intruder detection, gaming, etc. In this work, we present a system, named Tadar, for tracking moving objects without instrumenting them us- ing COTS RFID readers and tags. It works even through walls and behind closed doors. It aims to enable a see-through-wall technology that is low-cost, compact, and accessible to civilian purpose. In traditional RFID systems, tags modulate their IDs on the backscatter signals, which is vulnerable to the interferences from the ambient reflections. Unlike past work, which considers such vulnerability as detrimental, our design exploits it to detect surrounding objects even through walls. Specifically, we attach a group of RFID tags on the outer wall and logically convert them into an antenna array, receiving the signals reflected off moving objects. This paper introduces two main innovations. First, it shows how to eliminate the flash (e.g. the stronger reflections off walls) and extract the reflections from the backscatter signals. Second, it shows how to track the moving object based on HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and its reflections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to implement a through-wall tracking using the COTS RFID systems. Empirical measurements with a prototype show that Tadar can detect objects behind 5" hollow wall and 8" concrete wall, and achieve median tracking errors of 7.8cm and 20cm in the X and Y dimensions.

Come and Be Served: Parallel Decoding for COTS RFID Tags
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Current commodity RFID systems incur high communication overhead due to severe tag-to-tag collisions. Although some recent works have been proposed to support parallel decoding for concurrent tag transmissions, they require accurate channel measurements, tight tag synchronization, or modifications to standard RFID tag operations. In this paper, we present BiGroup, a novel RFID communication paradigm that allows the reader to decode the collision from multiple COTS (commodity-off-the-shelf) RFID tags in one communication round. In BiGroup, COTS tags can directly join ongoing communication sessions and get decoded in parallel. The collision resolution intelligence is solely put at the reader side. To this end, BiGroup examines the tag collisions at RFID physical layer from constellation domain as well as time domain, exploits the under-utilized channel capacity due to low tag transmission rate, and leverages tag diversities. We implement BiGroup with USRP N210 software radio that is able to read and decode multiple concurrent transmissions from COTS passive tags. Our experimental study gives encouraging results that BiGroup greatly improves RFID communication efficiency, i.e., 11&#215; performance improvement compared to the alternative decoding scheme for COTS tags and 6&#215; gain in time efficiency when applied to EPC C1G2 tag identification.

Last-Mile Navigation Using Smartphones
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Although GPS has become a standard component of smartphones, providing accurate navigation during the last portion of a trip remains an important but unsolved problem. Despite extensive research on localization, the limited resolution of a map imposes restrictions on the navigation engine in both indoor and outdoor environments. To bridge the gap between the end position obtained from legacy navigation services and the real destination, we propose FollowMe, a "last-mile" navigation system to enable plug-and-play navigation in indoor and semi-outdoor environments. FollowMe exploits the ubiquitous, stable geomagnetic field and natural walking patterns to navigate the users to the same destination taken by an earlier traveler. Unlike existing localization and navigation systems, FollowMe is infrastructure-free, energy-efficient and cost-saving. We implemented FollowMe on smartphones, and evaluated it in a four-story campus building with a testing area of 2000m2. Our experimental results with 5 users show that 95% of spatial errors during navigation were 2m or less with at least 50% energy savings over a benchmark system.

EchoTag: Accurate Infrastructure-Free Indoor Location Tagging with Smartphones
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
We propose a novel mobile system, called EchoTag, that enables phones to tag and remember indoor locations without requiring any additional sensors or pre-installed infrastructure. The main idea behind EchoTag is to actively generate acoustic signatures by transmitting a sound signal with a phone's speakers and sensing its reflections with the phone's microphones. This active sensing provides finer-grained control of the collected signatures than the widely-used passive sensing. For example, because the sensing signal is controlled by EchoTag, it can be intentionally chosen to enrich the sensed signatures and remove noises from useless reflections. Extensive experiments show that EchoTag distinguishes 11 tags at 1cm resolution with 98% accuracy and maintains 90% accuracy even a week after its training. With this accurate location tagging, one can realize many interesting applications, such as automatically turning on the silent mode of a phone when it is placed at a pre-defined location/area near the bed or streaming favorite songs to speakers if it is placed near a home entertainment system. Most participants of our usability study agree on the usefulness of EchoTag's potential applications and the adequacy of its sensing accuracy for supporting these applications.

ToneTrack: Leveraging Frequency-Agile Radios for Time-Based Indoor Wireless Localization
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Indoor localization of mobile devices and tags has received much attention recently, with encouraging fine-grained localization results available with enough line-of-sight coverage and hardware infrastructure. Some of the most promising techniques analyze the time-of-arrival of incoming signals, but the limited bandwidth available to most wireless transmissions fundamentally constrains their resolution. Frequency-agile wireless networks utilize bandwidths of varying sizes and locations in a wireless band to efficiently share the wireless medium between users. ToneTrack is an indoor location system that achieves sub-meter accuracy with minimal hardware and antennas, by leveraging frequency-agile wireless networks to increase the effective bandwidth. Our novel signal combination algorithm combines time-of-arrival data from different transmissions as a mobile device hops across different channels, approaching time resolutions previously not possible with a single narrowband channel. ToneTrack's novel channel combination and spectrum identification algorithms together with the triangle inequality scheme yield superior results even in non-line-of-sight scenarios with one to two walls separating client and APs and also in the case where the direct path from mobile client to an AP is completely blocked. We implement ToneTrack on the WARP hardware radio platform and use six of them served as APs to localize Wi-Fi clients in an indoor testbed over one floor of an office building. Experimental results show that ToneTrack can achieve a median 90 cm accuracy when 20 MHz bandwidth APs overhear three packets from adjacent channels.

mZig: Enabling Multi-Packet Reception in ZigBee
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
This paper presents mZig, a novel physical layer design that enables a receiver to simultaneously decode multiple packets from different transmitters in ZigBee. As a low-power and low-cost wireless protocol, the promising ZigBee has been widely used in sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and smart buildings. Since ZigBee based networks usually adopt tree or cluster topology, the convergecast scenarios are common in which multiple transmitters need to send packets to one receiver. For example, in a smart home, all appliances report data to one control plane via ZigBee. However, concurrent transmissions in convergecast lead to the severe collision problem. The conventional ZigBee avoids collisions using backoff time, which introduces additional time overhead. Advanced methods resolve collisions instead of avoidance, in which the state-of-the-art ZigZag resolves one m-packet collision requiring m retransmissions. We propose mZig to resolve one m-packet collision by this collision itself, so the theoretical throughput is improved m-fold. Leveraging the unique features in ZigBee's physical layer including its chip rate, half-sine pulse shaping and O-QPSK modulation, mZig subtly decomposes multiple packets from one collision in baseband signal processing. The practical factors of noise, multipath, and frequency offset are taken into account in mZig design. We implement mZig on USRPs and establish a seven-node testbed. Experiment results demonstrate that mZig can receive up to four concurrent packets in our testbed. The throughput of mZig is 4.5x of the conventional ZigBee and 3.2x of ZigZag in the convergecast with four or more transmitters.

AirExpress: Enabling Seamless In-band Wireless Multi-hop Transmission
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
This paper describes the design and implementation of AirExpress, a system that enables in-band wireless cut-through transmission. Unlike wired cut-through, wireless cut-through can reduce latency and improve throughput performance of the network at the same time. In AirExpress, all the forwarders along the cut-through path forward the signal they received immediately without decoding. The hierarchical structure of AirExpress enables its interference cancellation ability to handle all kinds of interference among the radios. Novel MAC and routing algorithms based on cut-through transmission are also proposed to support the realization of AirExpress in multi-hop mesh networks. AirExpress is implemented on an NI-based SDR platform. Through experiments in the 2.4GHz ISM band, we show throughput gain of up to 3.4 times with a 4-hop AirExpress system. Trace driven evaluation of AirExpress on the NS3 platform shows an average throughput gain of 2.85 for AirExpress over optimal TDMA.

Control Channel Design for Many-Antenna MU-MIMO
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Many-antenna MU-MIMO faces a critical, previously unaddressed challenge: it lacks a practical control channel. At the heart of this challenge is that the potential range of MU-MIMO beamforming systems scales with up to the square of the number of base-station antennas once they have channel state information (CSI), whereas the range of traditional control channel operations remains constant since they take place before or during CSI acquisition. This range gap between no-CSI and CSI modes presents a critical challenge to the efficiency and feasibility of many-antenna base stations, as their operational range is limited to the no-CSI mode. We present a novel control channel design for many-antenna MU-MIMO, Faros, that allows the number of base-station antennas to scale up to 100s in practice. Faros leverages a combination of open-loop beamforming and coding gains to bridge the range gap between the CSI and no-CSI modes. Not only does Faros provide an elegant and efficient control channel for many-antenna MU-MIMO, but on a more fundamental level it exposes flexible, fine-grained, control over space, time, and code resources, which enables previously impossible optimizations. We implement our design on the Argos many-antenna base station and evaluate its performance in bridging the range gap, synchronization, and paging. With 108 antennas, Faros can provide over 40 dB of gain, which enables it to function reliably at over 250 meters outdoors with less than 100 &#956;W of transmit power per antenna, 10 mW total, at 2.4 GHz.

QuickSync: Improving Synchronization Efficiency for Mobile Cloud Storage Services
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
Mobile cloud storage services have gained phenomenal success in recent few years. In this paper, we identify, analyze and address the synchronization (sync) inefficiency problem of modern mobile cloud storage services. Our measurement results demonstrate that existing commercial sync services fail to make full use of available bandwidth, and generate a large amount of unnecessary sync traffic in certain circumstance even though the incremental sync is implemented. These issues are caused by the inherent limitations of the sync protocol and the distributed architecture. Based on our findings, we propose QuickSync, a system with three novel techniques to improve the sync efficiency for mobile cloud storage services, and build the system on two commercial sync services. Our experimental results using representative workloads show that QuickSync is able to reduce up to 52.9% sync time in our experiment settings.

FlexiWeb: Network-Aware Compaction for Accelerating Mobile Web Transfers
Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2015
To reduce page load times and bandwidth usage for mobile web browsing, middleboxes that compress page content are commonly used today. Unfortunately, this can hurt performance in many cases; via an extensive measurement study, we show that using middleboxes to facilitate compression results in up to 28% degradation in page load times when the client enjoys excellent wireless link conditions. We find that benefits from compression are primarily realized under bad network conditions. Guided by our study, we design and implement FlexiWeb, a framework that determines both when to use a middlebox and how to use it, based on the client's network conditions. First, FlexiWeb selectively fetches objects on a web page either directly from the source or via a middlebox, rather than fetching all objects via the middlebox. Second, instead of simply performing lossless compression of all content, FlexiWeb performs network-aware compression of images by selecting from among a range of content transformations. We implement and evaluate a prototype of FlexiWeb using Google's open source Chromium mobile browser and our implementation of a modified version of Google's open source compression proxy. Our extensive experiments show that, across a range of scenarios, FlexiWeb reduces page load times for mobile clients by 35-42% compared to the status quo.

WEBee: Physical-Layer Cross-Technology Communication via Emulation
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Recent advances in Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) have improved efficient coexistence and cooperation among heterogeneous wireless devices (e.g., WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth) operating in the same ISM band. However, until now the effectiveness of existing CTCs, which rely on packet-level modulation, is limited due to their low throughput (e.g., tens of bps). Our work, named WEBee, opens a promising direction for high-throughput CTC via physical-level emulation. WEBee uses a high-speed wireless radio (e.g., WiFi OFDM) to emulate the desired signals of a low-speed radio (e.g., ZigBee). Our unique emulation technique manipulates only the payload of WiFi packets, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies -- a feature allowing zero-cost fast deployment on existing WiFi infrastructure. We designed and implemented WEBee with commodity devices (Atheros AR2425 WiFi card and MicaZ CC2420) and the USRP-N210 platform (for PHY layer evaluation). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that WEBee can achieve a more than 99% reliable parallel CTC between WiFi and ZigBee with 126 Kbps in noisy environments, a throughput about 16,000x faster than current state-of-the-art CTCs.

Stateful Inter-Packet Signal Processing for Wireless Networking
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Traditional signal processing design (e.g., frequency offset and channel estimation) at a receiver treats each packet arrival as an independent process to facilitate decoding and interpreting packet data. In this paper, we enhance the performance of this process in the wireless network domain. We propose STAteful inter-Packet signaL procEssing (STAPLE), a framework of stateful signal processing residing between the physical and link layers. STAPLE transforms the signal processing procedure into a lightweight stateful process that caches in a small-sized memory table physical and link layer header fields as packet state information. The similarity of such information among packets serves as prior knowledge to further enhance the reliability of signal processing and thus improve the wireless network performance. We implement STAPLE on USRP X300-series devices with adapted configurations for 802.11a/b/g/n/ac and 802.15.4. The STAPLE prototype is of low processing complexity and does not change any wireless standard specification. Comprehensive experimental results show that the benefit from STAPLE is universal in various wireless networks.

WiFi-Assisted 60 GHz Wireless Networks
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Despite years of innovative research and development, gigabit-speed 60 GHz wireless networks are still not mainstream. The main concern for network operators and vendors is the unfavorable propagation characteristics due to short wavelength and high directionality, which renders the 60 GHz links highly vulnerable to blockage and mobility. However, the advent of multi-band chipsets opens the possibility of leveraging the more robust WiFi technology to assist 60 GHz in order to provide seamless, Gbps connectivity. In this paper, we design and implement MUST, an IEEE 802.11-compliant system that provides seamless, high-speed connectivity over multi-band 60 GHz and WiFi devices. MUST has two key design components: (1) a WiFi-assisted 60 GHz link adaptation algorithm, which can instantaneously predict the best beam and PHY rate setting, with zero probing overhead; and (2) a proactive blockage detection and switching algorithm which can re-direct ongoing user traffic to the robust interface within sub-10 ms latency. Our experiments with off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware show that MUST can achieve 25-60% throughput gain over state-of-the-art solutions, while bringing almost 2 orders of magnitude cross-band switching latency improvement.

Pose Information Assisted 60 GHz Networks: Towards Seamless Coverage and Mobility Support
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
60 GHz millimeter-wave networking has emerged as the next frontier technology to provide multi-Gbps wireless connectivity. However, the intrinsic directionality and limited field-of-view of 60 GHz antennas make the links extremely sensitive to user mobility and orientation change. Hence, seamless coverage, even at room level, becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose Pia, a robust 60 GHz network architecture that can provide seamless coverage and mobility support at multi-Gbps bitrate. Pia comprises multiple cooperating access points (APs). It leverages the pose information on mobile clients to proactively select the AP and manage multi-link spatial reuse. These decisions require a model of the pose/location of the APs and ambient reflectors. We address these challenges through a set of AP-pose sensing and compressive angle estimation algorithms that fuse the pose measurement with link quality measurement on the client. We have implemented Pia using commodity 60 GHz platforms. Our experiments show that Pia reduces the occurrence of link outage by 6.3x and improves the spatial sharing capacity by 76%, compared to conventional schemes that only use in-band information for adaptation.

A Control-Plane Perspective on Reducing Data Access Latency in LTE Networks
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Control-plane operations are indispensable to providing data access to mobile devices in the 4G LTE networks. They provision necessary control states at the device and network nodes to enable data access. However, the current design may suffer from long data access latency even under good radio conditions. The fundamental problem is that, data-plane packet delivery cannot start or resume until all control-plane procedures are completed, and these control procedures run sequentially by design. We show both are more than necessary under popular use cases. We design DPCM, which reduces data access latency through parallel processing approaches and exploiting device-side state replica. We implement DPCM and validate its effectiveness with extensive evaluations.

Open experimentation with operational Mobile Broadband (MBB) networks in the wild is currently a fundamental requirement of the research community in its endeavor to address the need of innovative solutions for mobile communications. Even more, there is a strong need for objective data about stability and performance of MBB (e.g., 3G/4G) networks, and for tools that rigorously and scientifically assess their status. In this paper, we introduce the MONROE measurement platform: an open access and flexible hardware-based platform for measurements and custom experimentation on operational MBB networks. The MONROE platform enables accurate, realistic and meaningful assessment of the performance and reliability of 11 MBB networks in Europe. We report on our experience designing, implementing and testing the solution we propose for the platform. We detail the challenges we overcame while building and testing the MONROE testbed and argue our design and implementation choices accordingly. We describe and exemplify the capabilities of the platform and the wide variety of experiments that external users already perform using the system.

In an increasingly mobile connected world, our user experience of mobile applications more and more depends on the performance of cellular radio access networks (RAN). To achieve high quality of experience for the user, it is imperative that operators identify and diagnose performance problems quickly. In this paper, we describe our experience in understanding the challenges in automating the diagnosis of RAN performance problems. Working with a major cellular network operator on a part of their RAN that services more than 2 million users, we demonstrate that fine-grained modeling and analysis could be the key towards this goal. We describe our methodology in analyzing RAN problems, and highlight a few of our findings, some previously unknown. We also discuss lessons from our attempt at building automated diagnosis solutions.

Adding the Next Nine: An Investigation of Mobile Broadband Networks Availability
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
The near ubiquitous availability and success of mobile broadband networks has motivated verticals that range from public safety communication to intelligent transportation systems and beyond to consider choosing them as the communication mean of choice. Several of these verticals, however, expect high availability of multiple nines. This paper leverages end-to-end measurements to investigate the potential of current mobile broadband networks to support these expectations. We conduct a large-scale measurement study of network availability in four networks in Norway. This study is based on three years of measurements from hundreds of stationary measurement nodes and several months of measurements from four mobile nodes. We find that the mobile network centralized architecture and infrastructure sharing between operators are responsible for a non-trivial fraction of network failures. Most episodes of degraded availability, however, are uncorrelated. We also find that using two networks simultaneously can result in more than five nines of availability for stationary nodes and three nines of availability for mobile nodes. Our findings point to potential avenues for enhancing the availability of future mobile networks.

The Tick Programmable Low-Latency SDR System
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Tick is a new SDR system that provides programmability and ensures low latency at both PHY and MAC. It supports modular design and element-based programming, similar to the Click router framework [23]. It uses an accelerator-rich architecture, where an embedded processor executes control flows and handles various MAC events. User-defined accelerators offload those tasks, which are either computation-intensive or communication-heavy, or require fine-grained timing control, from the processor, and accelerate them in hardware. Tick applies a number of hardware and software co-design techniques to ensure low latency, including multi-clock-domain pipelining, field-based processing pipeline, separation of data and control flows, etc. We have implemented Tick and validated its effectiveness through extensive evaluations as well as two prototypes of 802.11ac SISO/MIMO and 802.11a/g full-duplex.

BiPass: Enabling End-to-End Full Duplex
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Full duplex techniques can potentially double the channel capacity and achieve lower delays by empowering two radios to simultaneously transmit in thesame frequency band.However, full duplex is only available between two adjacent nodes within the communication range. In this paper, we present BiPass to break this limitation.With the help of full duplex capable relays, weenable simultaneous bidirectional in-band cut-through transmissions between two far apart nodes, so they can do full duplex communications as if they were within each other's transmission range.To design such a system, we analyze interference patterns and propose a loop-back interference cancellation strategy. We identify the power amplification problem at relay nodes and develop an algorithm to solve it. We also develop a routing algorithm, an opportunistic forwarding scheme, and a real-time feedback strategy to leverage this system in ad-hoc networks.To evaluate the real world performance of BiPass, we build a prototype and conduct experiments using software defined radios. We show that BiPass can achieve 1.6x median throughput gain over state-of-the-art one-way cut-through systems, and 4.09x gain over the decode-and-forward scheme. Our simulations further reveal that even when the data traffic is not bidirectional, BiPass has 1.36x throughput gain and 47\% delay reduction overone-way cut-through systemsin large networks.

Orion: RAN Slicing for a Flexible and Cost-Effective Multi-Service Mobile Network Architecture
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
Emerging 5G mobile networks are envisioned to become multi-service environments, enabling the dynamic deployment of services with a diverse set of performance requirements, accommodating the needs of mobile network operators, verticals and over-the-top (OTT) service providers. Virtualizing the mobile network in a flexible way is of paramount importance for a cost-effective realization of this vision. While virtualization has been extensively studied in the case of the mobile core, virtualizing the radio access network (RAN) is still at its infancy. In this paper, we present Orion, a novel RAN slicing system that enables the dynamic on-the-fly virtualization of base stations, the flexible customization of slices to meet their respective service needs and which can be used in an end-to-end network slicing setting. Orion guarantees the functional and performance isolation of slices, while allowing for the efficient use of RAN resources among them. We present a concrete prototype implementation of Orion for LTE, with experimental results, considering alternative RAN slicing approaches, indicating its efficiency and highlighting its isolation capabilities. We also present an extension to Orion for accommodating the needs of OTT providers.

Accelerating Multipath Transport Through Balanced Subflow Completion
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Simultaneously using multiple network paths (e.g., WiFi and cellular) is an attractive feature on mobile devices. A key component in a multipath system such as MPTCP is the scheduler, which determines how to distribute the traffic over multiple paths. In this paper, we propose DEMS, a new multipath scheduler aiming at reducing the data chunk download time. DEMS consists of three key design decisions: (1) being aware of the chunk boundary and strategically decoupling the paths for chunk delivery, (2) ensuring simultaneous subflow completion at the receiver side, and (3) allowing a path to trade a small amount of redundant data for performance. We have implemented DEMS on smartphones and evaluated it over both emulated and real cellular/WiFi networks. DEMS is robust to diverse network conditions and brings significant performance boost compared to the default MPTCP scheduler (e.g., median download time reduction of 33%--48% for fetching files and median loading time reduction of 6%--43% for fetching web pages), and even more benefits compared to other state-of-the-art schedulers.

FSONet: A Wireless Backhaul for Multi-Gigabit Picocells Using Steerable Free Space Optics
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Expected increase in cellular demand has pushed recent interest in picocell networks which have reduced cell sizes (100-200m or less). For ease of deployment of such networks, a wireless backhaul network is highly desired. Since RF-based technologies are unlikely to provide the desired multi-gigabit data rates, we motivate and explore use of free space optics (FSO) for picocell backhaul. In particular, we present a novel network architecture based on steerable links and sufficiently many robust short-range links, to help circumvent the key challenge of outdoor effects in reliable operation of outdoor FSO links. Our architecture is motivated by the fact that, due to the high density of picocells, many short-range links will occur naturally in a picocell backhaul. Moreover, use of steerable FSO links facilitates networks with sufficient redundancy while using only a small number of interfaces per node. We address the key problems that arise in the context of such a backhaul architecture, viz., an FSO link design with desired characteristics, and related network design and management problems. We develop and evaluate a robust 100m FSO link prototype, and simulate the proposed architecture in many metro US cities while show its viability via evaluation of key performance metrics.

MagneComm: Magnetometer-based Near-Field Communication
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Near-field communication (NFC) plays a crucial role in the operation of mobile devices to enhance applications such as payment, social networks, private communication, gaming, and etc. Despite of the convenience, existing NFC standards like ISO-13157 require additional hardware (e.g., loop antenna and dedicated chip) and thereby hindering their wide-scale applications. In this work, we seek to propose a novel near-field communication protocol, MagneComm, which utilizes Magnetic Induction (MI) signals emitted from CPUs and captured by magnetometers on mobile devices for communication. Since CPUs and magnetometers are readily available components in mobile devices, MagneComm eliminates the requirement for special hardware and complements existing near-field communication protocols by providing additional bandwidth. We systematically analyze the characteristics of magnetic signals of CPUs and facilitate MagneComm with one-way communication, full-duplex communication, and multi-transmitter schemes in accordance with the hardware availability on devices. We prototype MagneComm on both laptops and smartphones. Extensive evaluation results show that MagneComm achieves up to 110bps within 10cm.

PassiveVLC: Enabling Practical Visible Light Backscatter Communication for Battery-free IoT Applications
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
This paper investigates the feasibility of practical backscatter communication using visible light for battery-free IoT applications. Based on the idea of modulating the light retroreflection with a commercial LCD shutter, we effectively synthesize these off-the-shelf optical components into a sub- mW low power visible light passive transmitter along with a retroreflecting uplink design dedicated for power constrained mobile/IoT devices. On top of that, we design, implement and evaluate PassiveVLC, a novel visible light backscatter communication system. PassiveVLC system enables a battery-free tag device to perform passive communication with the illuminating LEDs over the same light carrier and thus offers several favorable features including battery-free, sniff-proof, and biologically friendly for human-centric use cases. Experimental results from our prototyped system show that PassiveVLC is flexible with tag orientation, robust to ambient lighting conditions, and can achieve up to 1 kbps uplink speed. Link budget analysis and two proof-of-concept applications are developed to demonstrate PassiveVLC's efficacy and practicality.

ReflexCode: Coding with Superposed Reflection Light for LED-Camera Communication
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
As a popular approach to implementing Visible Light Communication (VLC) on commercial-off-the-shelf devices, LED-Camera VLC has attracted substantial attention recently. While such systems initially used reflected light as the communication media, direct light becomes the dominant media for the purpose of combating interference. Nonetheless, the data rate achievable by direct light LED-Camera VLC systems has hit its bottleneck: the dimension of the transmitters. In order to further improve the performance, we revisit the reflected light approach and we innovate in converting the potentially destructive interferences into collaborative transmissions. Essentially, our ReflexCode system codes information by superposing light emissions from multiple transmitters. It combines traditional amplitude demodulation with slope detection to "decode" the grayscale modulated signal, and it tunes decoding thresholds dynamically depending on the spatial symbol distribution. In addition, ReflexCode re-engineers the balanced codes to avoid flicker from individual transmitters. We implement ReflexCode as two prototypes and demonstrate that it can achieve a throughput up to 3.2kb/s at a distance of 3m.

Navigating the Chasm between Curiosity- and Impact-Driven Research
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Being in academia provides a unique opportunity to explore one's curiosity and build cool systems that advance human understanding of engineering and science. System researchers however also have a responsibility to build systems that can impact practice in the near-term and perhaps, even create a brand new industry. In my talk, I will focus on my efforts so far navigating this chasm between curiosity and impact driven research. Specifically, I will share two research themes I have been working on as an assistant professor at UW CSE, where what initially began as curiosity-driven projects were transformed by the urge to make immediate practical impact as well as be unique. In particular, I will first talk about our journey going from a science-driven project on ambient backscatter (Sigcomm'13) to building wireless backscatter systems that work reliably and address a key pain-point in the industry. Next, I will talk about how we shifted gears from working on wireless gesture recognition (WiSee, Mobicom'13) to addressing a medical need of millions of people in the United States that go undiagnosed from sleep apnea (ApneaApp, Mobisys'15) and our experience licensing our technology to a multi-national medical corporation. Finally, I will share my thoughts on how our research community can help us better navigate this chasm.

Pulsar: Towards Ubiquitous Visible Light Localization
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
The past decade's research in visible light positioning (VLP) has led to technologies with high location precision. However, existing VLP systems either require specialized LEDs which hinder large-scale deployment, or need cameras which preclude continuous localization because of high power consumption and short coverage. In this paper, we propose Pulsar, which uses a compact photodiode sensor, readily fit into a mobile device, to discriminate existing ceiling lights---either fluorescent lights or conventional LEDs---based on their intrinsic optical emission features. To overcome the photodiode's lack of spatial resolution, we design a novel sparse photogrammetry mechanism, which resolves the light source's angle-of-arrival, and triangulates the device's 3D location and even orientation. To facilitate ubiquitous deployment, we further develop a light registration mechanism that automatically registers the ceiling lights' locations as landmarks on a building's floor map. Our experiments demonstrate that Pulsar can reliably achieve decimeter precision in both controlled environment and large-scale buildings.

RF-Echo: A Non-Line-of-Sight Indoor Localization System Using a Low-Power Active RF Reflector ASIC Tag
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Long-range low-power localization is a key technology that enables a host of new applications of wireless sensor nodes. We present RF-Echo, a new low-power RF localization solution that achieves decimeter accuracy in long range indoor non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. RF-Echo introduces a custom-designed active RF reflector ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) fabricated in a 180nm CMOS process which echoes a frequency-shifted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal originally generated from an anchor. The proposed technique is based on time-of-flight (ToF) estimation in the frequency domain that effectively eliminates inter-carrier and inter-symbol interference in multipath-rich indoor NLOS channels. RF-Echo uses a relatively narrow bandwidth of $\leq$80 MHz which does not require an expensive very high sampling rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Unlike ultra-wideband (UWB) systems, the active reflection scheme is designed to operate at a relatively low carrier frequency that can penetrate building walls and other blocking objects for challenging NLOS scenarios. Since the bandwidth at lower frequencies (2.4 GHz and sub-1 GHz) is severely limited, we propose novel signal processing algorithms as well as machine learning techniques to significantly enhance the localization resolution given the bandwidth constraint of the proposed system. The newly fabricated tag IC consumes 62.8 mW active power. The software defined radio (SDR) based anchor prototype is rapidly deployable without the need for accurate synchronization among anchors and tags. Field trials conducted in a university building confirm up to 85 m operation with decimeter accuracy for robust 2D localization.

Simultaneous Power-Based Localization of Transmitters for Crowdsourced Spectrum Monitoring
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
The current mechanisms for locating spectrum offenders are time consuming, human-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to locate spectrum offenders using crowdsourcing. In such a participatory sensing system, privacy and bandwidth concerns preclude distributed sensing devices from reporting raw signal samples to a central agency; instead, devices would be limited to measurements of received power. However, this limitation enables a smart attacker to evade localization by simultaneously transmitting from multiple infected devices. Existing localization methods are insufficient or incapable of locating multiple sources when the powers from each source cannot be separated at the receivers. In this paper, we first propose a simple and efficient method that simultaneously locates multiple transmitters using the received power measurements from the selected devices. Second, we build sampling approaches to select sensing devices required for localization. Next, we enhance our sampling to also take into account incentives for participation in crowdsourcing. We experimentally evaluate our localization framework under a variety of settings and find that we are able to localize multiple sources transmitting simultaneously with reasonably high accuracy in a timely manner.

Minding the Billions: Ultra-wideband Localization for Deployed RFID Tags
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
State-of-the-art RFID localization systems fall under two categories. The first category operates with off-the-shelf narrowband RFID tags but makes restrictive assumptions on the environment or the tag's movement patterns. The second category does not make such restrictive assumptions; however, it requires designing new ultra-wideband hardware for RFIDs and uses the large bandwidth to directly compute a tag's 3D location. Hence, while the first category is restrictive, the second one requires replacing the billions of RFIDs already produced and deployed annually. This paper presents RFind, a new technology that brings the benefits of ultra-wideband localization to the billions of RFIDs in today's world. RFind does not require changing today's passive narrowband RFID tags. Instead, it leverages their underlying physical properties to emulate a very large bandwidth and uses it for localization. Our empirical results demonstrate that RFind can emulate over 220MHz of bandwidth on tags designed with a communication bandwidth of only tens to hundreds of kHz, while remaining compliant with FCC regulations. This, combined with a new super-resolution algorithm over this bandwidth, enables RFind to perform 3D localization with sub-centimeter accuracy in each of the x/y/z dimensions, without making any restrictive assumptions on the tag's motion or the environment.

RIO: A Pervasive RFID-based Touch Gesture Interface
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
In this paper, we design and develop RIO, a novel battery-free touch sensing user interface (UI) primitive for future IoT and smart spaces. RIO enables UIs to be constructed using off-the-shelf RFID readers and tags, and provides a unique approach to designing smart IoT spaces. With RIO, any surface can be turned into a touch-aware surface by simply attaching RFID tags to them. RIO also supports custom-designed RFID tags, and thus allows specially customized UIs to be easily deployed into a real-world environment. RIO is built using the technique of impedance tracking: when a human finger touches the surface of an RFID tag, the impedance of the antenna changes. This change manifests as a change in the phase of the RFID backscattered signal, and is used by RIO to track fine-grained touch movement over both off-the shelf and custom built tags. We study this impedance behavior in-depth and show how RIO is a reliable UI primitive that is robust even within a multi-tag environment. We leverage this primitive to build a prototype of RIO that can continuously locate a finger during a swipe movement to within 3 mm of its actual position. We also show how custom-design RFID tags can be built and used with RIO, and provide two example applications that demonstrate its real-world use.

FlipTracer: Practical Parallel Decoding for Backscatter Communication
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
With parallel decoding for backscatter communication, tags are allowed to transmit concurrently and more efficiently. Existing parallel decoding mechanisms, however, assume that signals of the tags are highly stable, and hence may not perform optimally in the naturally dynamic backscatter systems. This paper introduces FlipTracer, a practical system that achieves highly reliable parallel decoding even in hostile channel conditions. FlipTracer is designed with a key insight: although the collided signal is time-varying and irregular, transitions between signals' combined states follow highly stable probabilities, which offers important clues for identifying the collided signals, and provides us with an opportunity to decode the collided signals without relying on stable signals. Motivated by this observation, we propose a graphical model, called one-flip-graph (OFG), to capture the transition pattern of collided signals, and design a reliable approach to construct the OFG in a manner robust to the diversity in backscatter systems. Then FlipTracer can resolve the collided signals by tracking the OFG. We have implemented FlipTracer and evaluated its performance with extensive experiments across a wide variety of scenarios. Our experimental results have shown that FlipTracer achieves a maximum aggregated throughput that approaches 2 Mbps, which is 6x higher than the state-of-the-art.

TagScan: Simultaneous Target Imaging and Material Identification with Commodity RFID Devices
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Target imaging and material identification play an important role in many real-life applications. This paper introduces TagScan, a system that can identify the material type and image the horizontal cut of a target simultaneously with cheap commercial off the-shelf (COTS) RFID devices. The key intuition is that different materials and target sizes cause different amounts of phase and RSS (Received Signal Strength) changes when radio frequency (RF) signal penetrates through the target. Multiple challenges need to be addressed before we can turn the idea into a functional system including (i) indoor environments exhibit rich multipath which breaks the linear relationship between the phase change and the propagation distance inside a target; (ii) without knowing either material type or target size, trying to obtain these two information simultaneously is challenging; and (iii) stitching pieces of the propagation distances inside a target for an image estimate is non-trivial. We propose solutions to all the challenges and evaluate the system's performance in three different environments. TagScan is able to achieve higher than 94% material identification accuracies for 10 liquids and differentiate even very similar objects such as Coke and Pepsi. TagScan can accurately estimate the horizontal cut images of more than one target behind a wall.

Analog On-Tag Hashing: Towards Selective Reading as Hash Primitives in Gen2 RFID Systems
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Deployment of billions of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID tags has drawn much of the attention of the research community because of the performance gaps of current systems. In particular, hash-enabled protocol (HEP) is one of the most thoroughly studied topics in the past decade. HEPs are designed for a wide spectrum of notable applications (e.g., missing detection) without need to collect all tags. HEPs assume that each tag contains a hash function, such that a tag can select a random but predicable time slot to reply with a one-bit presence signal that shows its existence. However, the hash function has never been implemented in COTS tags in reality, which makes HEPs a 10-year untouchable mirage. This work designs and implements a group of analog on-tag hash primitives (called Tash) for COTS Gen2-compatible RFID systems, which moves prior HEPs forward from theory to practice. In particular, we design three types of hash primitives, namely, tash function, tash table function and tash operator. All of these hash primitives are implemented through selective reading, which is a fundamental and mandatory functionality specified in Gen2 protocol, without any hardware modification and fabrication. We further apply our hash primitives in two typical HEP applications (i.e., cardinality estimation and missing detection) to show the feasibility and effectiveness of Tash. Results from our prototype, which is composed of one ImpinJ reader and 3,000 Alien tags, demonstrate that the new design lowers 60% of the communication overhead in the air. The tash operator can additionally introduce an overhead drop of 29.7%.

Cardiac Scan: A Non-contact and Continuous Heart-based User Authentication System
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
Continuous authentication is of great importance to maintain the security level of a system throughout the login session. The goal of this work is to investigate a trustworthy, continuous, and non-contact user authentication approach based on a heart-related biometric that works in a daily-life environment. To this end, we present a novel, continuous authentication system, namely Cardiac Scan, based on geometric and non-volitional features of the cardiac motion. Cardiac motion is an automatic heart deformation caused by self-excitement of the cardiac muscle, which is unique to each user and is difficult (if not impossible) to counterfeit. Cardiac Scan features intrinsic liveness detection, unobtrusiveness, cost-effectiveness, and high usability. We prototype a remote, high-resolution cardiac motion sensing system based on the smart DC-coupled continuous-wave radar. Fiducial-based invariant identity descriptors of cardiac motion are extracted after the radar signal demodulation. We conduct a pilot study with 78 subjects to evaluate Cardiac Scan in accuracy, authentication time, permanence, evaluation in complex conditions, and vulnerability. Specifically, Cardiac Scan achieves 98.61% balanced accuracy (BAC) and 4.42% equal error rate (EER) in a real-world setup. We demonstrate that Cardiac Scan is a robust and usable continuous authentication system.

Automating Visual Privacy Protection Using a Smart LED
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
The ubiquity of mobile camera devices has been triggering an outcry of privacy concerns, whereas privacy protection still relies on the cooperation of the photographer or camera hardware, which can hardly be guaranteed in practice. In this paper, we introduce LiShield, which automatically protects a physical scene against photographing, by illuminating it with smart LEDs flickering in specialized waveforms. We use a model-driven approach to optimize the waveform, so as to ensure protection against the (uncontrollable) cameras and potential image-processing based attacks. We have also designed mechanisms to unblock authorized cameras and enable graceful degradation under strong ambient light interference. Our prototype implementation and experiments show that LiShield can effectively destroy unauthorized capturing while maintaining robustness against potential attacks.

Continuous Authentication for Voice Assistants
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Voice has become an increasingly popular User Interaction (UI) channel, mainly contributing to the current trend of wearables, smart vehicles, and home automation systems. Voice assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Now, have become our everyday fixtures, especially when/where touch interfaces are inconvenient or even dangerous to use, such as driving or exercising. The open nature of the voice channel makes voice assistants difficult to secure, and hence exposed to various threats as demonstrated by security researchers. To defend against these threats, we present VAuth, the first system that provides continuous authentication for voice assistants. VAuth is designed to fit in widely-adopted wearable devices, such as eyeglasses, earphones/buds and necklaces, where it collects the body-surface vibrations of the user and matches it with the speech signal received by the voice assistant's microphone. VAuth guarantees the voice assistant to execute only the commands that originate from the voice of the owner. We have evaluated VAuth with 18 users and 30 voice commands and find it to achieve 97% detection accuracy and less than 0.1% false positive rate, regardless of VAuth's position on the body and the user's language, accent or mobility. VAuth successfully thwarts various practical attacks, such as replay attacks, mangled voice attacks, or impersonation attacks. It also incurs low energy and latency overheads and is compatible with most voice assistants.

NICScatter: Backscatter as a Covert Channel in Mobile Devices
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Today's mobile devices contain sensitive data, which raises concerns about data security. This paper discusses a covert channel threat on existing mobile systems. Through it, malware can wirelessly leak information without making network connections or emitting signals, such as sound, EMR, vibration, etc., that we can feel or are aware of. The covert channel is built on a communication method that we call NICScatter. NICScatter transmitter malware forces mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops, to reflect surrounding RF signals to covertly convey information. The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device's wireless network interface card (NIC). Importantly, the operation requires no special privileges on current mobile OSs, which allows the malware to stealthily pass sensitive data to an attacker's nearby mobile device, which can then decode the signal and thus effectively gather the guarded data. Our experiments with different mobile devices show that the covert channel can achieve 1.6 bps and transmit as far as 2 meters. In a through-the-wall scenario, it can transmit up to 70 cm.

UIWear: Easily Adapting User Interfaces for Wearable Devices
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Wearable devices such as smartwatches offer exciting new opportunities for users to interact with their applications. However, the current wearable programming model requires the developer to write a custom companion app for each wearable form factor; the companion app extends the smartphone display onto the wearable, relays user interactions from the wearable to the phone, and updates the wearable display as needed. The development effort required to write a companion app is significant and will not scale to an increasing diversity of form factors. This paper argues for a different programming model for wearable devices. The developer writes an application for the smartphone, but only specifies a UI design for the wearable. Our UIWear system abstracts a logical model of the smartphone GUI, re-tailors the GUI for the wearable device based on the specified UI design, and compiles it into a companion app that we call the UICompanion app. We implemented UIWear on Android smartphones, AndroidWear smartwatches, and Sony SmartEyeGlasses. We evaluate 20 developer-written companion apps from the AndroidWear category on Google Play against the UIWear-created UICompanion apps. The lines-of-code required for the developer to specify the UI design in UIWear is an order-of-magnitude smaller compared to the companion app lines-of-code. Further, in most cases, the UICompanion app performed comparably or better than the corresponding companion app both in terms of qualitative metrics, including latency and energy, and quantitative metrics, including look-and-feel.

TinyLink: A Holistic System for Rapid Development of IoT Applications
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Rapid development is essential for IoT (Internet of Things) application developers to obtain first-mover advantages and reduce the development cost. In this paper, we present TinyLink, a holistic system for rapid development of IoT applications. The key idea of TinyLink is to use a top-down approach for designing both the hardware and the software of IoT applications. Developers write the application code in a C-like language to specify the key logic of their applications, without dealing with the details of the specific hardware components. Taking the application code as input, TinyLink automatically generates the hardware configuration as well as the binary program executable on the target hardware platform. TinyLink provides unified APIs for applications to interact with the underlying hardware components. We implement TinyLink and evaluate its performance using real-world IoT applications. Results show that: (1) TinyLink achieves rapid development of IoT applications, reducing 52.58% of lines of code in average compared with traditional approaches; (2) TinyLink searches a much larger design space and thus can generate a superior solution for the hardware configuration, compared with the state-of-the-art approach; (3) TinyLink incurs acceptable overhead in terms of execution time and program memory.

BlueMountain: An Architecture for Customized Data Management on Mobile Systems

In this paper, we design a pluggable data management solution for modern mobile platforms (e.g., Android). Our goal is to allow data management mechanisms and policies to be implemented independently of core app logic. Our design allows a user to install data management solutions as apps, install multiple such solutions on a single device, and choose a suitable solution each for one or more apps. It allows app developers to focus their effort on app logic and helps the developers of data management solutions to achieve wider deployability. It also gives increased control of data management to end users and allows them to use different solutions for different apps. We present a prototype implementation of our design called BlueMountain, and implement several data management solutions for file and database management to demonstrate the utility and ease of using our design. We perform detailed microbenchmarks as well as end-to-end measurements for files and databases to demonstrate the performance overhead incurred by our implementation.

Furion: Engineering High-Quality Immersive Virtual Reality on Today's Mobile Devices
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
In this paper, we perform a systematic design study of the "elephant in the room" facing the VR industry -- is it feasible to enable high-quality VR apps on untethered mobile devices such as smartphones? Our quantitative, performance-driven design study makes two contributions. First, we show that the QoE achievable for high-quality VR applications on today's mobile hardware and wireless networks via local rendering or offloading is about 10X away from the acceptable QoE, yet waiting for future mobile hardware or next-generation wireless networks (e.g. 5G) is unlikely to help, because of power limitation and the higher CPU utilization needed for processing packets under higher data rate. Second, we present Furion, a VR framework that enables high-quality, immersive mobile VR on today's mobile devices and wireless networks. Furion exploits a key insight about the VR workload that foreground interactions and background environment have contrasting predictability and rendering workload, and employs a split renderer architecture running on both the phone and the server. Supplemented with video compression, use of panoramic frames, and parallel decoding on multiple cores on the phone, we demonstrate Furion can support high-quality VR apps on today's smartphones over WiFi, with under 14ms latency and 60 FPS (the phone display refresh rate).

RAVEN: Perception-aware Optimization of Power Consumption for Mobile Games

High-end mobile GPUs are now becoming an integral part of mobile devices. However, a mobile GPU constitutes a major portion of power consumption on the devices, and mobile games top as the most popular class of graphics applications. This paper presents the design and implementation of RAVEN, a novel, on-the-fly frame rate scaling system for mobile gaming applications. RAVEN utilizes human visual perception of graphics change to opportunistically achieve power saving without degrading user experiences. The system develops a light-weight frame comparison technique to measure and predict perception-aware frame similarity. It also builds a low resolution virtual display which clones the device screen for performing similarity measurement at a low-power cost. It is able to work on an existing commercial smartphone and support applications from app stores without any modifications. It has been implemented on Nexus 5X, and its performance has been measured with 13 games. The system effectively reduces the overall power consumption of mobile devices while maintaining satisfactory user experiences. The power consumption is reduced by 21.78% on aver-age and up to 34.74%.

Unfortunately, it is also one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks: placing measurement tools in remote networks or end-clients requires one to marshal resources from different administrative domains, devices, populations, and countries. Often such efforts culminate in a trace that is deficient in multiple ways: a small set of test subjects, a short time frame, missing ground truth for device IDs, networking environments lacking in diversity and geographic spread, or highly biased sampling. We present a method of addressing these challenges by leveraging the most open and globally accessible test and measurement platform: digital advertising. Digital advertising instantly provides a window into 7 billion devices spanning every county for an extremely low cost. We propose Advertising as a Platform (AaaP), an ad-based system to perform massive-scale mobile measurement studies. In contrast with measurements made by large media companies who own platforms, ad networks, and apps, we concentrate on the opportunities and challenges for researchers that are end-users of advertising systems. We evaluate a prototype system, discuss ethical guidelines, and demonstrate its use in four scenarios: IP2Geo databases, bandwidth measurement, energy management, and the identifiability of mobile users. We show the efficacy and ease-of-use of AaaP, and illuminate key challenges and the great promise of using AaaP to study a wide variety of mobile phenomena.

NutShell: Scalable Whittled Proxy Execution for Low-Latency Web over Cellular Networks
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Despite much recent progress, Web page latencies over cellular networks remain much higher than those over wired networks. Proxies that execute Web page JavaScript (JS) and push objects needed by the client can reduce latency. However, a key concern is the scalability of the proxy which must execute JS for many concurrent users. In this paper, we propose to scale the proxies, focusing on a design where the proxy's execution is solely to push the needed objects and the client completely executes the page as normal. Such redundant execution is a simple, yet effective approach to cutting network latencies, which dominate page load delays in cellular settings. We develop whittling, a technique to identify and execute in the proxy only the JS code necessary to identify and push the objects required for the client page load, while skipping other code. Whittling is closely related to program slicing, but with the important distinction that it is acceptable to approximate the program slice in the proxy given the client's complete execution. Experiments with top Alexa Web pages show NutShell can sustain, on average, 27\% more user requests per second than a proxy performing fully redundant execution, while preserving, and sometimes enhancing, the latency benefits.

Demo: The Sound of Silence: End-to-End Sign Language Recognition Using SmartWatch
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
Sign Language is a natural and fully-fledged communication method for deaf and hearing-impaired people. In this demo, we propose the first SmartWatch-based American sign language (ASL) recognition system, which is more comfortable, portable and user-friendly and offers accessibility anytime, anywhere. This system is based on the intuitive idea that each sign has its specific motion pattern which can be transformed into unique gyroscope and accelerometer signals and then analyzed and learned by using Long-Short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC). In this way, signs and context information can be correctly recognized based on an off-the-shelf device (eg. SmartWatch, Smartphone). The experiments show that, in the Known user split task, our system reaches an average word error rate of 7.29% to recognize 73 sentences formed by 103 ASL signs and achieves detection ratio up to 93.7% for a single sign. The result also shows our system has a good adaptation, even including new users, it can achieve an average word error rate of 21.6% at the sentence level and reach an average detection ratio of 79.4%. Moreover, our system performs real time ASL translation, outputting the speech within 1.69 seconds for a sentence of 12 signs in average.

Demo: FlexRAN: A Software-Defined RAN Platform
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Although SDN is considered as one of the key technologies behind the impending 5G evolution of mobile networks, the opportunity of reaping its benefits is largely still untapped on the Radio Access Network (RAN) side due to the lack of a software-defined RAN (SD-RAN) platform. In this work we demonstrate the capabilities of FlexRAN, an open-source SD-RAN platform developed to fill this void. FlexRAN separates the RAN control and data planes with a custom-tailored southbound API. Besides it features a hierarchical control plane architecture that enables programmability, flexible and dynamic control function placement (allowing different degrees of coordination within and among base stations) and real-time control. Virtualized control functions and control delegation are two key features in FlexRAN that makes these capabilities possible. This demo illustrates the capabilities and the performance of FlexRAN based on a prototype implementation, while its applicability is highlighted through a Mobile Edge Computing use case, where it acts as an enabler of a video bitrate adaptation application based on the radio conditions at the network edge.

Demo: Orion: A Radio Access Network Slicing System
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
Emerging 5G mobile networks are envisioned to support the dynamic deployment of services with diverse performance requirements, accommodating the needs of mobile network operators and verticals. Virtualizing the mobile network components in a flexible and cost-effective way is therefore of paramount importance. In this work, we highlight the capabilities of Orion, a novel RAN slicing architecture that enables the dynamic virtualization of base stations and flexible customization of slices to meet their respective service needs. Our demonstration of Orion's capabilities is based on a prototype implementation employing a modified version of the OpenAirInterface software LTE platform. Using this prototype, we demonstrate the functional and performance isolation, and the efficient sharing of radio hardware and spectrum that can be achieved among Orion RAN slices. Moreover, we show how Orion can be used in an end-to-end network slicing setting and demonstrate the effects of the slices' configuration and placement of virtual functions in the overall quality of the deployed services.

We present an innovative smartphone-centric tracking system for indoor and outdoor environments, based on the joint utilization of dead-reckoning and computer vision (CV) techniques. The system is explicitly designed for visually impaired people (although it could be easily generalized to other users) and it is built under the assumption that special reference signals, such as painted lines, colored tapes or tactile pavings are deployed in the environment for guiding visually impaired users along pre-defined paths. Thanks to highly optimized software, we are able to execute the CV and sensor-fusion algorithms in run-time on low power hardware such as a normal smartphone, precisely tracking the users movements.

Demo: A Cell-level Traffic Generator for LoRa Networks

In this demo we present and validate a LoRa cell traffic generator, able to emulate the behavior of thousands of low-rate sensor nodes deployed in the same cell, by using a single Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. Differently from traditional generators, whose goal is creating packet flows which emulate specific applications and protocols, our focus is generating a combined radio signal, as seen by a gateway, given by the super-position of the signals transmitted by multiple sensors simultaneously active on the same channel. We argue that such a generator can be of interest for testing different network planning solutions for LoRa networks.

Demo: DEMS: DEcoupled Multipath Scheduler for Accelerating Multipath Transport
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
We present the demonstration of DEMS, a new multipath scheduler aiming at reducing the data chunk download time. DEMS consists of three key design decisions: (1) being aware of the chunk boundary and strategically decoupling the paths for chunk delivery, (2) ensuring simultaneous subflow completion at the receiver side, and (3) allowing a path to trade a small amount of redundant data for performance. We integrate the DEMS components into a holistic system and implement it on commodity mobile devices, where unmodified mobile applications can use DEMS to transmit data over multipath. We demonstrate the simple configuration of using DEMS over multipath, visualization of multipath scheduling, download time reduction of data chunks with DEMS over both emulated and real cellular/WiFi networks compared to default MinRTT scheduler, and application QoE improvement on mobile phones from DEMS.

Software-defined Networking (SDN) is seen as a promising solution that allows for a more distributed, flexible, and scalable network. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), initiated as an Industry Specification Group (ISG) within ETSI, is also emerging as a low-latency and high-throughput cloud environment at the edge of network. The noticeable success that aforementioned technologies made attracts massive research interests and the interplay between them on programmable network requires an open source platform to evaluate. In this work, we present a low-latency MEC platform (LL-MEC) providing the required flexibility and programmability to meet the expected performance gain following SDN and MEC principles. We also demonstrate an use case of real-time content caching application using LL-MEC platform and OpenAirInterface LTE implementation on commodity hardware.

Demo: BlueBee: 10,000x Faster Cross-Technology Communication from Bluetooth to ZigBee
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Cross-Technology Communication is an emerging research direction providing a promising solution to the coexistence problem of heterogeneous wireless technologies in the ISM bands. However, existing works use only the coarse-grained packet-level information for cross-technology modulation, suffering from a low throughput (e.g., 10bps). Our approach, called BlueBee, aims at achieving much higher CTC throughput thus extends CTC applications. We pro- poses a new direction by emulating legitimate ZigBee frames using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio. Uniquely, BlueBee achieves dual-standard compliance (i.e., BLE and ZigBee) and transparency by selecting only the payload of Bluetooth frames, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes at the BLE senders and ZigBee receivers. Our implementation on commodity device testbeds shows that BlueBee can achieve a more than 99% accuracy and a through- put 10,000x faster than the state-of-the-art CTC reported so far. In addition, we show a demo of using BlueBee on a smartphone to control several smart light bulbs a ached with ZigBee radio.

Demo: Position Tracking for Virtual Reality Using Commodity WiFi
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Today, experiencing virtual reality (VR) is a cumbersome experience which either requires dedicated infrastructure like infrared cameras to track the headset and hand-motion controllers (e.g. Oculus Rift, HTC Vive), or provides only 3-DoF (Degrees of Freedom) tracking which severely limits the user experience (e.g. Samsung Gear VR). To truly enable VR everywhere, we need position tracking to be available as a ubiquitous service. This paper demonstrates WiCapture, a novel approach which leverages commodity WiFi infrastructure, which is ubiquitous today, for tracking purposes. We prototyped WiCapture using off-the-shelf WiFi radios and demonstrated that it achieves an accuracy of 0.88 cm compared to sophisticated infrared-based tracking systems like the Oculus Rift, while providing much higher range, resistance to occlusion, ubiquity and ease of deployment.

Demo: WEBee: Physical-Layer Cross-Technology Communication via Emulation
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
The applicability of existing Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) methods, which rely on packet-level modulation, is severely limited due to their very low throughput, e.g., tens of bps. Our work, named as WEBee, opens a promising direction for high throughput CTC via physical-level emulation. Specifically, WEBee synthesizes the time-domain signals by choosing appropriate frequency-domain components fed into the subcarriers of WiFi OFDM. WE-Bee can emulate the desired physical-layer ZigBee signals by manipulating only the data bits in WiFi packet payload, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies. Moreover, WEBee enables the parallel CTC, where one WiFi frame emulates two ZigBee frames simultaneously. To evaluate the performance, we implemented WEBee on commodity devices (the Atheros AR2425 WiFi card, BCM 4330 WiFi card and CC2420, CC2530 ZigBee devices). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that WEBee can achieve the CTC between WiFi and ZigBee with a reliable throughput of 126Kbps in noisy environment, 16,000x faster than current state-of-the-art CTC methods.

Demo: WiFi-Assisted 60 GHz Wireless Networks
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Despite years of innovative research and development, multi-Gbps 60 GHz wireless networks are still not mainstream. The unfavorable propagation characteristics due to short wavelength and high directionality, makes the 60 GHz links highly vulnerable to blockage and mobility. However, the advent of multi-band chipsets opens the possibility of leveraging the more robust WiFi technology to assist 60 GHz in order to provide seamless, Gbps connectivity. In this demonstration, we will present MUST, an 802.11-compliant real-time system that provides seamless, high-speed connectivity over multi-band 60 GHz and WiFi devices. MUST has two key design components: (1) a WiFi-assisted 60 GHz link adaptation algorithm, which can instantaneously predict the best beam and PHY rate setting, with zero probing overhead at 60 GHz; and (2) a proactive blockage detection and switching algorithm which can re-direct ongoing user traffic to the robust interface within sub-10 ms latency. We have implemented MUST on off-the-shelf devices where our experiments show high throughput gain and almost 2 orders of magnitude cross-band switching latency improvement over state-of-the-art solutions.

Demo: Dynamic Adaptations of WiFi Channel Widths Without TX/RX Coordination
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Most modern standards for wireless communications support physical layer adaptations, in terms of dynamic selection of channel central frequency, transmission power, modulation format, etc., in order to increase link robustness under time-varying propagation and interference conditions. In this demo, we demonstrate that another powerful solution for extending physical layer flexibility in OFDM-based technologies is the dynamic adaptation of the channel width. Although some standards already define the possibility of utilizing multiple channel widths (e.g. 20MHz, 10MHz, 5MHz for IEEE 802.11a standards), such an utilization is limited to a static configuration of a value defined during the network set-up. Conversely, we demonstrate that channel width adaptations can be performed in real-time during network operation, even on a per-packet basis. To this purpose, we propose an innovative and efficient receiver design, which allows the transmitter to take decisions about the channel width without explicitly informing the receiver.

Demo: UIWear: Easily Adapting User Interfaces for Wearable Devices
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Wearable devices, such as smart watches, offer exciting new opportunities for users to interact with their applications. The current state of the art for wearable devices is for a developer to write a custom {\em companion app}, which is a variant of the smartphone app, tailored to the wearable form factor. A developer puts a non-trivial amount of effort to write these companion apps and the programming model does not scale to an increasing diversity of form factors. In this demo, we show a working prototype of our system UIWear that allows a developer to easily extend a smartphone application to other wearable interfaces. Our system, UIWear, extracts the application GUI as a UI tree, which preserves the semantics of the GUI. The developer (or the user) only writes a {\em metaprogram} to encode the GUI design for the wearable device; no effort is needed beyond the design phase. UIWear executes the metaprogram by performing all the underlying tasks to virtualize the application GUI, adapt it, and recreate it on the wearable. A metaprogram can create the same functionality as existing companion apps with an order-of-magnitude less programming effort.

Demo: Coding with Superposed Reflection Light for LED-Camera Communication
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
As a popular approach to implementing Visible Light Communication (VLC) on commercial-off-the-shelf devices, LED-Camera VLC has attracted substantial attention recently. While such systems initially used reflected light as the communication media, direct light becomes the dominant media for the purpose of combating interference. Nonetheless, the data rate achievable by direct light LED-Camera VLC systems has hit its bottleneck: the dimension of the transmitters. In this demo, we revisit the reflected light approach and propose a novel modulation mechanism, ReflexCode, which converts the potentially destructive interferences into collaborative transmissions. Essentially, our ReflexCode system codes information by superposing light emissions from multiple transmitters. It combines traditional amplitude demodulation with slope detection to "decode" the grayscale modulated signal, and it tunes decoding thresholds dynamically depending on the spatial symbol distribution. In addition, ReflexCode re-engineers the balanced codes to avoid flicker from individual transmitters. We implement ReflexCode as a prototype and demonstrate that it can achieve a promising throughput.

Demo: Stuffing Wi-Fi Beacons for Fun and Profit
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Ubiquitous Wi-Fi access points (APs) constantly send out beacon and probe response frames to inform potential stations (STAs) about their existence. Beacon and probe responses can be extended by adding additional information (so-called beacon stuffing) making it possible to deliver this information to mobile devices (e.g. smart-phones equipped with 802.11 interfaces) without the need for association with the local infrastructure. This feature can be used to support location-based information services (LBS) related for e.g. advertising local opportunities, temporary obstacles and traffic disturbances or emergency notifications. In this paper we introduce a demonstrator for Location-based Wi-Fi Services (LoWS) based on beacon stuffing. The LoWS system can be easily installed within an existent 802.11 infrastructure while the receiver application can be installed on nearly all up-to-date commercial off-the-shelf smartphones, e.g. based on Android or iOS.

We compensate minute hand sway movements to identify small surface recessions, thus detecting doors automatically. Additionally, we leverage structure cues in indoor environments for user trace calibration. The demo will enable any person to hold the smartphone and walk along a corridor to map the corridor shape and detect doors in real-time.

Demo: LiShield: Privacy Protection of Physical Environment Against Photographing

The ubiquity of mobile camera devices has been triggering an outcry of privacy concerns, whereas privacy protection still relies on the compliance of the photographer or camera hardware, which can hardly be guaranteed in practice. In this demo, we introduce LiShield, which automatically protects a physical scene against photographing, by illuminating it with smart LEDs flickering in a specialized waveform. We use a model-driven approach to optimize the waveform, so as to ensure protection against the (uncontrollable) cameras and potential image-processing based attacks. We have also designed mechanisms to unblock authorized cameras and enable graceful degradation under strong ambient light interference. This demo will show our prototype implementation, with simple on-site experiments that demonstrate how LiShield effectively destroys unauthorized photo capturing.

Poster: Resource Allocation with Conflict Resolution for Vehicular Sidelink Broadcast Communications
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
In this paper we present a graph-based resource allocation scheme for sidelink broadcast V2V communications. Harnessing available information on geographical position of vehicles and spectrum resources utilization, eNodeBs are capable of allotting the same set of sidelink resources to different vehicles distributed among several communications clusters. Within a communications cluster, it is crucial to prevent time-domain allocation conflicts since vehicles cannot transmit and receive simultaneously, i.e., they must transmit in orthogonal time resources. In this research, we present a solution based on a bipartite graph, where vehicles and spectrum resources are represented by vertices whereas the edges represent the achievable rate in each resource based on the SINR that each vehicle perceives. The aforementioned time orthogonality constraint can be approached by aggregating conflicting vertices into macro-vertices which, in addition, reduces the search complexity. We show mathematically and through simulations that the proposed approach yields an optimal solution. In addition, we provide simulations showing that the proposed method outperforms other competing approaches, specially in scenarios with high vehicular density.

Poster: Link Line Crossing Speed Estimation with Narrowband Signal Strength
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

We present results from a system which uses received signal strength (RSS) measurements to estimate the speed at which a person is walking when they cross the link line. While many RSS-based device-free localization systems can detect a line crossing, this system estimates additionally the speed of crossing, which can provide significant additional information to a tracking system. Further, unlike device-free RF sensors which occupy tens of MHz of bandwidth, this system uses a channel of about 10 kHz. Experiments with a person walking from 0.3 to 1.8 m/s show the system can measure walking speed within 0.05 m/s RMS error.

2017
The rapid growth in mobile connectivity is enabling phones to support a wide range of societally-important applications. In this work, we show that broad classes of popular mobile applications have distinct radio resource allocation signatures. Using this insight, we design a mobile application classifier, and demonstrate that (1) an application can infer its own type solely from its resource allocation patterns, and (2) anyone can accurately infer the type of application being served by each session on a particular cell tower. We present our findings by showing the breakdown of applications being served by an LTE base station belonging to a Tier 1 US provider in downtown Palo Alto. Our work encourages an open discussion about LTE standards, and whether they might need to be enhanced to mask features that can be exploited to infer application type from signals broadcast over the air.

Poster: Toward a Better Monitoring of Air Pollution using Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSN) are widely used for monitoring physical phenomena such as air pollution where the aim is usually to generate accurate pollution maps in real time. The generation of pollution maps can be performed using either sensor measurements or physical models which simulate the phenomenon of pollution dispersion. The combination of these two information sources, known as data assimilation, makes it possible to better monitor air pollution by correcting the simulations of physical models while relying on sensor measurements. The quality of data assimilation mainly depends on the number of measurements and their locations. A careful deployment of nodes is therefore necessary in order to get better pollution maps. In this ongoing work, we tackle the placement problem of pollution sensors and design a mixed integer programming model allowing to maximize the assimilation quality while ensuring the connectivity of the network. We perform some simulations on a dataset of the Lyon city, France in order to show the effectiveness of our model regarding the quality of pollution coverage.

Poster: DeepTFP: Mobile Time Series Data Analytics based Traffic Flow Prediction
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
Traffic flow prediction is an important research issue to avoid traffic congestion in transportation systems. Traffic congestion avoiding can be achieved by knowing traffic flow and then conducting transportation planning. Achieving traffic flow prediction is challenging as the prediction is affected by many complex factors such as inter-region traffic, vehicles' relations, and sudden events. However, as the mobile data of vehicles has been widely collected by sensor-embedded devices in transportation systems, it is possible to predict the traffic flow by analysing mobile data. This study proposes a deep learning based prediction algorithm, DeepTFP, to collectively predict the traffic flow on each and every traffic road of a city. This algorithm uses three deep residual neural networks to model temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of traffic flow. Each residual neural network consists of a branch of residual convolutional units. DeepTFP aggregates the outputs of the three residual neural networks to optimize the parameters of a time series prediction model. Contrast experiments on mobile time series data from the transportation system of England demonstrate that the proposed DeepTFP outperforms the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture based method in prediction accuracy.

Driver assistance systems, that rely on vehicular sensors such as cameras, LIDAR and other on-board diagnostic sensors, have progressed rapidly in recent years to increase road safety. Road conditions in developing countries like India are chaotic where roads are not well maintained and thus vehicular sensors alone do not suffice in detecting impending collisions. In this paper, we investigate a collaborative driver assistance system "DRIZY: DRIve eaSY" for such scenarios where inference is drawn from on-board camera feed to alert drivers of obstacles ahead and the cloud uses GPS sensor data uploaded by all vehicles to alert drivers of vehicles in potential collision trajectory. Thus, we combine computer vision and vehicle-to-cloud communication to create comprehensive situational awareness. We prototype our system to consider two types of collisions: vehicle-to-vehicle collisions based on uploading GPS sensor data of vehicles to cloud and vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions based on detecting pedestrians from vehicle's dashboard camera feed. Sensor data processing in each vehicle occurs on smartphone for GPS values which are then uploaded to cloud and on raspberry pi3 for video feeds to make a cost-effective solution. Experiments over both 4G and wireless networks in India show that collaborative driver assistance is feasible in low traffic density within acceptable driver reaction time of <5 sec, but can be limited by the time to process compute-intensive video feeds in real-time. We investigate novel ways to optimize the processing to find an acceptable trade-off.

Poster: Emotion-Aware Smart Tips for Healthy and Happy Sleep
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
People spend up to one-third of lives asleep, and healthy sleep habits can make a big difference in their quality of life. But in modern society, many people have unhealthy sleep diaries and suffer from various sleep disorders, which may result in irregular mood fluctuations or even mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. We propose the Emotion-Aware Smart Tips (EAST), a novel approach that could help to inform users about their irregular emotional states with smart tips to improve their sleep qualities. EAST aims at helping users keep healthy sleep schedules and emotional states by providing smart tips through a novel model that combines multivariate regression, random forest, and neural network to quantify the relations between sleep patterns and emotional states. Prototype implementation and initial experiments of EAST in mobile phones have demonstrated its desired functionality and practicality for real-world deployment.

2017
In this poster we present IoTurva, a platform for securing Device-to-Device (D2D) communication in IoT. Our solution takes a blackbox approach to secure IoT edge-networks. We combine user and device-centric context-information together with network data to classify network communication as normal or malicious. We have designed a dual-layer traffic classification scheme based on fuzzy logic, where the classification model is trained remotely. The remotely trained model is then used by the edge gateway to classify the network traffic. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype and evaluate its performance in a real world environment. Theevaluation shows that IoTurva causes very small overhead while it works with minimal hardware, and that our model training and classification approach can improve system efficiency and privacy.

Poster: A Portfolio Theory Approach to Edge Traffic Engineering via Bayesian Networks
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
One of the main goals of mobile edge computing is to support new generation latency-sensitive networked applications. To manage such demanding applications, a fine-grained control of end-to-end paths is imperative. End-to-end delay estimation and forecast techniques were essential traffic engineering tools even before the mobile edge computing paradigm pushed the cloud closer to the end user. In this paper, we model the path selection problem for edge traffic engineering using a risk minimization technique inspired by portfolio theory in economics, and we use machine learning to estimate the risk of a path. In particular, using real latency time series measurements, collected with and without the GENI testbed, we compare four short-horizon latency estimation techniques, commonly used by the finance community to estimate prices of volatile financial instruments. Our initial results suggest that a Bayesian Network approach may lead to good latency estimation performance and open a few research questions that we are currently exploring.

Poster: Interacting Data-Intensive Services Mining and Placement in Mobile Edge Clouds
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
With the rapid growth of cloud computing and mobile computing, it is commonplace for users to request cloud services from mobile devices. Mobile edge clouds (MECs) allow the users to access the cloud services seamlessly. Although cloudlets provide a promising technique to reduce the service access latency, how to place the data-intensive service in MECs to reduce the communication overhead between different services is yet to be addressed. To attack this challenge, this paper proposes an approach for mining interacting services and placing the services on the cloudlets by optimizing the communication overhead. In this approach, a frequent itemsets mining algorithm is proposed to obtain the fine-grained frequent 2-itemsets by analyzing the cookies. This algorithm determines the minimum support threshold automatically, based on which FP-tree with FP-matrix is constructed to avoid traversing the FP-tree during the process of frequent 2-itemsets discovery, then a searching algorithm is presented to mine the discriminative frequent 2-itemsets with interestingness measure. Furthermore, the communication overhead is optimized with the capacity constraints of cloudlets. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by real-world data based simulations. The results show our approach can reduce the communication overhead for service placement in MECs.

Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
We present LAN Radio, an Open Source prototyping system to couple simulation and real world for the wireless channel of IEEE 802.11p based communication. Our main focus is the use in a vehicular networking environment, where field testing and real world experimentation is becoming more relevant these days. Large Field Operational Tests (FOTs) are expensive and difficult to handle in terms of reproducibility and controllability -- particularly for application development and integration tests for automotive Electronic Control Units (ECUs). To support such experiments, we developed an approach to integrate a real system to test into a large scale simulation scenario without the need to change the physical and access layer parts of the communication stack of this system. We closely followed the Hardware In The Loop (HIL) simulation concept but also integrated a wireless communication channel into the picture. LAN Radio is building upon the well established and Open Source development platform OpenWRT to provide optimal extensibility.

Poster: FooDNet: Optimized On Demand Take-out Food Delivery using Spatial Crowdsourcing
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
This paper builds a Food Delivery Network (FooDNet) that investigates the usage of urban taxis to support on demand take-out food delivery by leveraging spatial crowdsourcing. Unlike existing service sharing systems (e.g., ridesharing), the delivery of food in FooDNet is more time-sensitive and the optimization problem is more complex regarding high-efficiency, huge-number of delivery needs. In particular, we study the food delivery problem in association with the Opportunistic Online Takeout Ordering & Delivery service (O-OTOD). Specifically, the food is delivered incidentally by taxis when carrying passengers in the O-OTOD problem, and the optimization goal is to minimize the number of selected taxis to maintain a relative high incentive to the participated drivers. The two-stage method is proposed to solve the problem, consisting of the construction algorithm and the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm. Preliminary experiments based on real-world taxi trajectory datasets verify that our proposed algorithms are effective and efficient.

Poster: RQL: REST Query Language for Converting Firebase to a Mobile Cloud Computing Platform
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
MCC (Mobile Cloud Computing) performs computation offloading from mobile edge devices to centralized cloud services for achieving the reduction in resource consumption of mobile devices. MBaaS is considered as a new service model within the range of MCC and firebase by Google has been accepted as the most popular MBaaS. However, firebase has not made the efforts for performing computation offloading, as it is expected from an MCC platform. We have contributed in two folds by 1) identifying the limitations of firebase as an MCC platform and by 2) proposing RQL (REST Query Language) as a wrapper over firebase to improve its services for achieving computational offloading. RQL is used for requesting data in the form of JSON instead of using URLs for making REST requests. We have also explained different case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of RQL for converting firebase to an MCC platform.

Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
As the dominant mobile operating system in the markets of smartphones, Android platform is increasingly targeted by attackers. Besides, attackers often produce novel malware to bypass the conventional detection approaches, which are largely reliant on expert analysis to design the discriminative features manually. Therefore, more effective and easy-to-use approaches for detection of Android malware are in demand. In this paper, we design and implement EasyDefense, a lightweight defense system that is integrated with Android OS for easy and effective detection of Android malware utilizing machine learning methods and the ensemble of them. Besides universal static features such as permissions and API calls, EasyDefense also employs the N-gram features of operation codes (opcodes). These N-gram features are extracted and learnt automatically from raw data of applications. Experimental results on 204,650 applications show that users can easily and effectively protect the privacy and security on their smartphones through this system.

Poster: Can MPTCP Improve Performance for Dual-Band 60 GHz/5 GHz Clients?
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2017
This work conducts one of the first experimental studies of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) in dual-band 60 GHz/5 GHz WLANs using off-the-shelf hardware. We consider both uncoupled and different coupled congestion control algorithms, compare their performance and their potential to improve throughput over single path TCP, and uncover their limitations. In contrast to a recent study that reports reduced throughput with MPTCP compared to single path TCP over 60 GHz, our results show that significant performance improvements are possible, especially in the case of uncoupled congestion control. On the other hand, performance gains with coupled congestion control are lower as these algorithms often fail to fully utilize the capacity of both paths simultaneously. We also observe a pathological case that can lead to significantly reduced throughput with MPTCP regardless of the congestion control algorithm.

Poster: A VLC Solution for Smart Parking
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
With the rapid growth of vehicle ownership, parking has become an issue, especially in metropolitan areas -- the extra time for check-ins, check-outs and finding available parking spaces not only causes frustration and potential road rage on the driver side, but also increases the traffic congestion, gasoline waste and air pollution in consequence. In order to address these problems, the concept of "smart parking" is put forward. To make a parking lot "smart", we argue that three basic features, namely Vehicle Identification, Parking Space Detection and Indoor Localization are are critical and should be supported by the infrastructure. Herein, we present LightPark, a Visible Light Communication (VLC) solution to realize the vision of "smart parking". Building on top of the visible light backscatter communication primitive, LightPark is able to leverage the lighting infrastructure to perform scalable visible light communication and networking with the batter-free tag devices instrumented on the vehicles and parking spaces to manage the critical information such as identification and real-time location of vehicles, and status of parking spaces in a centralized and low-cost manner.

We present our efforts to design the first Visible Light Sensing (VLS) system that consumes only tens of &#956; Ws of power to sense and communicate.

We achieve this by designing a sensing mechanism that uses solar cells to achieve sub-&#956;Ws of power consumption. Further, we devise an ultra-low power backscatter based transmission mechanism we call Scatterlight that transmits digital readings without incurring the processing and computation overhead of existing sensors. Based on these principles we build a preliminary prototype. Our initial results demonstrate its ability to sense and communicate three hand gestures at 20 &#956;Ws of power.

Poster: Improving Multipath Resolution with MIMO Smoothing
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
Super-resolution subspace methods are popular in estimating multipath parameters such as angle of arrival and time of flight. However, they require decorrelation techniques to resolve coherent multipath components. The conventional decorrelation techniques reduce the effective aperture of the MIMO array, thus reducing the resolution and number of resolved paths. In this paper, we introduce MIMO smoothing as a new technique to bring decorrelation effect by leveraging the spacial and frequential diversity in MIMO transmitters and receivers. Via extensive experiments on WiFi links, we show that MIMO smoothing can increase the accuracy of multipath resolution.

Poster: Combating Multipaths to Enable RFID Sensing in Practical Environments
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
There have been increasing interests in exploring the sensing capabilities of RFID beyond its basic identification task, to reveal more information of tagged objects and the physical world. Phase is a crucial physical feature for many RFID sensing applications, such as tag localization. Most existing methods rely on a low multipath environment for accurate phase measurement. Unfortunately, practical environments are highly likely to be multipath-revalent, especially for indoors. This paper presents the first work to extract "clean" phase measurement of RFID tags in multipath-prevalent environments. We propose CPEX (Clean Phase EXtraction) based on theoretical modeling, which is also validated via experimental results of our prototype implementation. We studied the performance of CPEX on tag localization. CPEX can achieve median errors of 4.3-6.4cm (in different setups), which is the most accurate 3D tag localization result in multipath-prevalent environments.

It is envisioned in the future that not only smartphones will connect to cellular networks, but all kinds of different wearable devices, sensors, vehicles, home appliances, VR headsets, robots, will also connect to cellular networks. Because the characteristics of these devices differ largely, people argue that future 5G systems should be designed to elastically accommodate to the different users. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable core network called RECO that demonstrates how to implement customized virtual core network entities efficiently to suit for users with different characteristics. We then build a testbed to verify our proposed RECO architecture. Finally, we will open source our RECO in the near future so that the research community can take benefit out of it.

Poster: Enabling Secure Location Authentication in Drone
Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
With the popularity of commodity drones in a wide variety of applications, significant security issues have been raised. One of the major problems is that a legal drone may be illegally hijacked by GPS spoofing attacks. Though some GPS anti-spoofing techniques have been proposed, no effective technique has been implemented in commodity drones yet due to practical limitations. Motivated by the ubiquitous WiFi signals around us, we propose WiDrone, a WiFi fingerprint location cross-check based anti-hijacking system on commodity drones in this poster. WiDrone still relies on GPS for navigation but it will authenticate the destination by comparing current WiFi fingerprint (CWF) with the destination WiFi fingerprint (DWF) when the drone receives a landing order. Furthermore, we propose a WiFi fingerprint authentication algorithm to decide whether CWF matches DWF. We have designed and implemented the prototype of WiDrone on DJI Matrice 100 to ascertain the practicability of proposed system.

Control framework design is critical to future SDN/NFV-enabled satellite network. However, the current multi-layer constellation based solutions have drawbacks in terms of availability, latency, openness, etc. The key contribution in this work is the study of an efficient control framework, which logically consists of two parts: entity part and overlay part. The entity part is a novel heterogeneous single-layer LEO satellite network, while the overlay part implements a virtualized overlay network. We have implemented a lightweight prototype of our framework and compared it with a GEO satellite based solution (i.e. OpenSAN). We demonstrate proof-of-concept that our framework performs better than OpenSAN with respect to control latency and avoids potential system bottleneck.

Proceedings of the 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2017
Existing human activity recognition approaches require either the deployment of extra infrastructure or the cooperation of occupants to carry dedicated devices, which are expensive, intrusive and inconvenient for pervasive implementation. In this paper, we propose SmartSense, a device-free human activity recognition system based on a novel machine learning algorithm with existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi routers. By exploiting the prevalence of existing WiFi infrastructure in buildings, we developed a novel OpenWrt based firmware for COTS WiFi routers to collect the CSI measurements from regular data frames. To identify different human activities, an automatic kernel representation learning method, namely auto-HSRL, is established to selection informative Hilbert space patterns from time, frequency, wavelet, and shape domains. A new information fusion tool based on multi-view kernel learning is proposed to combine the representations extracted from diverse perspectives and build up a robust and comprehensive activity classifier. Extensive experiments were conducted in an office and the experimental results demonstrate that SmartSense outperforms existing methods and achieves a 98% activity recognition accuracy.

The darkLight rises: visible light communication in the dark
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as a new wireless communication technology with appealing benefits not present in radio communication. However, current VLC designs commonly require LED lights to emit shining light beams, which greatly limits the applicable scenarios of VLC (e.g., in a sunny day when indoor lighting is not needed). It also entails high energy overhead and unpleasant visual experiences for mobile devices to transmit data using VLC. We design and develop DarkLight, a new VLC primitive that allows light-based communication to be sustained even when LEDs emit extremely-low luminance. The key idea is to encode data into ultra-short, imperceptible light pulses. We tackle challenges in circuit designs, data encoding/decoding schemes, and DarkLight networking, to efficiently generate and reliably detect ultra-short light pulses using off-the-shelf, low-cost LEDs and photodiodes. Our DarkLight prototype supports 1.3-m distance with 1.6-Kbps data rate. By loosening up VLC's reliance on visible light beams, DarkLight presents an unconventional direction of VLC design and fundamentally broadens VLC's application scenarios.

Making sense of mechanical vibration period with sub-millisecond accuracy using backscatter signals
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Traditional vibration inspection systems, equipped with separated sensing and communication modules, are either very expensive (e.g., hundreds of dollars) and/or suffer from occlusion and narrow field of view (e.g., laser). In this work, we present an RFID-based solution, Tagbeat, to inspect mechanical vibration using COTS RFID tags and readers. Making sense of micro and high-frequency vibration using random and low-frequency readings of tag has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving sub-millisecond period accuracy. Our system achieves these three goals by discerning the change pattern of backscatter signal replied from the tag, which is attached on the vibrating surface and displaced by the vibration within a small range. This work introduces three main innovations. First, it shows how one can utilize COTS RFID to sense mechanical vibration and accurately discover its period with a few periods of short and noisy samples. Second, a new digital microscope is designed to amplify the micro-vibration-induced weak signals. Third, Tagbeat introduces compressive reading to inspect high-frequency vibration with relatively low RFID read rate. We implement Tagbeat using a COTS RFID device and evaluate it with a commercial centrifugal machine. Empirical benchmarks with a prototype show that Tagbeat can inspect the vibration period with a mean accuracy of 0.36ms and a relative error rate of 0.03%. We also study three cases to demonstrate how to associate our inspection solution with the specific domain requirements.

Messages behind the sound: real-time hidden acoustic signal capture with smartphones

With the ever-increasing use of smart devices, recent research endeavors have led to unobtrusive screen-camera communication channel designs, which allow simultaneous screen viewing and hidden screen-camera communication. Such practices, albeit innovative and effective, require well-controlled alignment of camera and screen and obstacle-free access. In this paper, we develop Dolphin, a novel form of real-time acoustics-based dual-channel communication, which uses a speaker and the microphones on off-the-shelf smartphones to achieve concurrent audible and hidden communication. By leveraging masking effects of the human auditory system and readily available audio signals in our daily lives, Dolphin ensures real-time unobtrusive speaker-microphone data communication without affecting the primary audio-hearing experience for human users, while, at the same time, it overcomes the main limitations of existing screen-camera links. Our Dolphin prototype, built using off-the-shelf smartphones, realizes real-time hidden communication, supports up to 8-meter signal capture distance and &plusmn;90&deg; listening angle and achieves decoding rate above 80% without error correction. Further, it achieves average data rates of up to 500bps while keeping the decoding rate above 95% within a distance of 1m.

Near-ultrasound communication for TV's 2nd screen services
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
In this paper, we propose a near-ultrasound chirp signal-based communication for the TV's 2nd screen services. While near-ultrasound (with under 20 kHz frequency) communication has been developed for various applications recently, none of the previous work provides a perfect solution for 2nd screen services between TVs and smart devices. This is due mainly to the following real world challenges. The embedded signal in TV contents should be successfully received in a typical TV-watching environment by (i) delivering information at least at 15 bps with significantly low volume to avoid human perception, (ii) despite the presence of ambient noise, e.g., a tick, a snap, or a knock. To fulfill (i), we design chirp quaternary orthogonal keying (QOK) symbols. Especially, we aim to minimize inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects by symbol design in order to completely eliminate guard intervals. To resolve (ii), we propose the novel J-shape detection algorithms for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing. The proposed modem achieves almost zero frame error rate on a smartphone 2.7 m away from the TV even with minimal receive sound pressure level of 35 dBSPL, i.e., the noise level in a very quiet room. Moreover, throughout experiments and log analysis of 2nd screen service deployed in a nation-wide TV broadcasting system, J-shape detection algorithms are proven to achieve highly resilient performance for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing compared to previous schemes.

Gyro in the air: tracking 3D orientation of batteryless internet-of-things
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
3D orientation tracking is an essential ingredient for many Internet-of-Things applications. Yet existing orientation tracking systems commonly require motion sensors that are only available on battery-powered devices. In this paper, we propose Tagyro, which attaches an array of passive RFID tags as orientation sensors on everyday objects. Tagyro uses a closed-form model to transform the run-time phase offsets between tags into orientation angle. To enable orientation tracking in 3D space, we found the key challenge lies in the imperfect radiation pattern of practical tags, caused by the antenna polarity, non-isotropic emission and electromagnetic coupling, which substantially distort phase measurement. We address these challenges by designing a set of phase sampling and recovery algorithms, which together enable reliable orientation sensing with 3 degrees of freedom. We have implemented a real-time version of Tagyro on a commodity RFID system. Our experiments show that Tagyro can track the 3D orientation of passive objects with a small error of 4&deg;, at a processing rate of 37.7 samples per second.

CAT: high-precision acoustic motion tracking

None
2016
Video games, Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Smart appliances (e.g., smart TVs) all call for a new way for users to interact and control them. This paper develops high-preCision Acoustic Tracker (CAT), which aims to replace a traditional mouse and let a user play games, interact with VR/AR headsets, and control smart appliances by moving a smartphone in the air. Achieving high tracking accuracy is essential to provide enjoyable user experience. To this end, we develop a novel system that uses audio signals to achieve mm-level tracking accuracy. It lets multiple speakers transmit inaudible sounds at different frequencies. Based on the received sound, our system continuously estimates the distance and velocity of the mobile with respect to the speakers to continuously track it. At its heart lies a distributed Frequency Modulated Continuous Waveform (FMCW) that can accurately estimate the absolute distance between a transmitter and a receiver that are separate and unsynchronized. We further develop an optimization framework to combine FMCW estimation with Doppler shifts and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to enhance the accuracy, and efficiently solve the optimization problem. We implement two systems: one on a desktop and another on a mobile phone. Our evaluation and user study show that our system achieves high tracking accuracy and ease of use using existing hardware.

Device-free gesture tracking using acoustic signals
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Device-free gesture tracking is an enabling HCI mechanism for small wearable devices because fingers are too big to control the GUI elements on such small screens, and it is also an important HCI mechanism for medium-to-large size mobile devices because it allows users to provide input without blocking screen view. In this paper, we propose LLAP, a device-free gesture tracking scheme that can be deployed on existing mobile devices as software, without any hardware modification. We use speakers and microphones that already exist on most mobile devices to perform device-free tracking of a hand/finger. The key idea is to use acoustic phase to get fine-grained movement direction and movement distance measurements. LLAP first extracts the sound signal reflected by the moving hand/finger after removing the background sound signals that are relatively consistent over time. LLAP then measures the phase changes of the sound signals caused by hand/finger movements and then converts the phase changes into the distance of the movement. We implemented and evaluated LLAP using commercial-off-the-shelf mobile phones. For 1-D hand movement and 2-D drawing in the air, LLAP has a tracking accuracy of 3.5 mm and 4.6 mm, respectively. Using gesture traces tracked by LLAP, we can recognize the characters and short words drawn in the air with an accuracy of 92.3% and 91.2%, respectively.

Emotion recognition using wireless signals
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2016
This paper demonstrates a new technology that can infer a person's emotions from RF signals reflected off his body. EQ-Radio transmits an RF signal and analyzes its reflections off a person's body to recognize his emotional state (happy, sad, etc.). The key enabler underlying EQ-Radio is a new algorithm for extracting the individual heartbeats from the wireless signal at an accuracy comparable to on-body ECG monitors. The resulting beats are then used to compute emotion-dependent features which feed a machine-learning emotion classifier. We describe the design and implementation of EQ-Radio, and demonstrate through a user study that its emotion recognition accuracy is on par with state-of-the-art emotion recognition systems that require a person to be hooked to an ECG monitor.

QuickC: practical sub-millisecond transport for small cells
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Cellular operators want to be able to deploy small cells with the same ease as WiFi access points, to quickly address traffic hotspots in dense urban areas. However, deploying small cells has not been easy. The reason is that due to scarcity of licensed spectrum, small cells need to use the same spectrum as the existing macro cells, and they need to explicitly coordinate their spectrum usage with each other to manage interference. The challenge is that this coordination needs to happen with latencies less than a millisecond, otherwise adding small cells does not help scale the overall network capacity. Implementing such tight coordination in dense urban deployments has not been easy in practice. We present QuickC, a wireless transport technology that can simplify small cell deployment. QuickC enables small cells to coordinate with their neighboring macro and small cells with sub-1ms latencies over the operator's licensed spectrum but in a way that the users of this spectrum are negligibly affected. QuickC is designed to be an "add on" to existing cellular networks and does not require any invasive changes to the existing infrastructure or standards. We implement QuickC on a commodity system on chip from Texas Instruments used for building commercial cellular baseband and show that it can consistently deliver latencies less than 0.6 ms between neighboring cells. We also use system-level simulations to evaluate the wide-area impact of deploying QuickC in current networks, and show that it can deliver 5--10 Mbps of bandwidth between neighboring cells while causing less than 1--4% throughput degradation to the existing users of the spectrum.

Practical MU-MIMO user selection on 802.11ac commodity networks
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Multi-User MIMO, the hallmark of IEEE 802.11ac and the upcoming 802.11ax, promises significant throughput gains by supporting multiple concurrent data streams to a group of users. However, identifying the best-throughput MU-MIMO groups in commodity 802.11ac networks poses three major challenges: a) Commodity 802.11ac users do not provide full CSI feedback, which has been widely used for MU-MIMO grouping. b) Heterogeneous channel bandwidth users limit grouping opportunities. c) Limited-resource on APs cannot support computationally and memory expensive operations, required by existing algorithms. Hence, state-of-the-art designs are either not portable in 802.11ac APs, or perform poorly, as shown by our testbed experiments. In this paper, we design and implement MUSE, a lightweight user grouping algorithm, which addresses the above challenges. Our experiments with commodity 802.11ac testbeds show MUSE can achieve high throughput gains over existing designs.

LTE in unlicensed spectrum: are we there yet?
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
In this work, we explore the potential and impact of unlicensed LTE on WiFi in unlicensed spectrum. Our experiments demonstrate that the large asymmetry in the channel access methodologies employed by WiFi and LTE (carrier sensing/notification in WiFi, energy sensing alone in LTE-U), can result LTE-U completely blocking WiFi transmissions, and causing significant degradation to either technologies from collisions. We address this critical sensing asymmetry with U<scp>ltron</scp>, a LTE-WiFi co-existence solution that integrates WiFi's carrier sensing and notification mechanisms into LTE, without any modifications to the LTE PHY standard. Ultron operates at the LTE base station and consists of two key components: (a) WiFi embedding that embeds appropriate data into the LTE-subframes through an intelligent reverse-engineering of the LTE PHY, so as to realize a WiFi PLCP preamble-header transmission over the air directly using the LTE PHY; and (b) scalable WiFi sensing that employs a single WiFi interface and maximizes its carrier sensing benefits to all the unlicensed channels operating at the LTE node. Our evaluations demonstrate that U<scp>ltron</scp> can increase the WiFi and LTE throughput by 5x and 6x respectively, resulting from a sharp reduction in LTE-WiFi interference.

BASIC: backbone-assisted successive interference cancellation
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
To meet the growing demand for wireless data, it is time to move away from the age-old paradigm of prohibiting interfering nodes from transmissions. Instead, through proactive management of interference among multiple colliding packets, we can design high throughput wireless systems. This is well explored in the Information Theory community and there are also a few implementational efforts that have been recently reported. The existing solutions are nontrivial to use in real systems as they require either tight time/frequency synchronization or exchange of data between transmitters prior to the transmissions. These requirements are hard to meet in practice especially for uplink transmissions. This paper proposes BASIC, a lightweight multi-user uplink transmission strategy that does not require tight synchronization or exchange of samples among nodes, which makes it an attractive alternative compared to its counterparts. BASIC exploits receiver diversity by controlling the data rates of the clients. A novel greedy algorithm is proposed for data rate selection. We implement BASIC on a software-defined radio platform. Our experiments on a real testbed show that BASIC outperforms TDMA by 48% in terms of overall throughput. Our trace-driven simulations show up to 4.8x gain in throughput with similar flow fairness.

OpenMili: a 60 GHz software radio platform with a reconfigurable phased-array antenna
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
The 60 GHz wireless technology holds great potential for multi-Gbps communications and high-precision radio sensing. But the lack of an accessible experimental platform has been impeding its progress. In this paper, we overcome the barrier with OpenMili, a reconfigurable 60 GHz radio architecture. OpenMili builds from off-the-shelf FPGA processor, data converters and 60 GHz RF front-end. It employs customized clocking, channelization and interfacing modules, to achieve Gsps sampling bandwidth, Gbps wireless bit-rate, and Gsps sample streaming from/to a PC host. It also incorporates the first programmable, electronically steerable 60 GHz phased-array antenna. OpenMili adopts programming models that ease development, through automatic parallelization inside signal processing blocks, and modular, rate-insensitive interfaces across blocks. It provides common reference designs to bootstrap the development of new network protocols and sensing applications. We verify the effectiveness of OpenMili through benchmark communication/sensing experiments, and showcase its usage by prototyping a pairwise phased-array localization scheme, and a learning-assisted real-time beam adaptation protocol.

A case for faster mobile web in cellular IPv6 networks
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
The transition to IPv6 cellular networks creates uncertainty for content providers (CPs) and content delivery networks (CDNs) of whether and how to follow suit. Do CPs that update their CDN contracts to allow IPv6 hosting achieve better, or worse performance in mobile networks? Should CDNs continue to host mobile content over IPv4 networks, or persuade to their CP customers the performance benefits of IPv6 content delivery? In this paper we answer these questions through a comprehensive comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 mobile Web performance in cellular networks in the US from the point of view of Akamai's content delivery infrastructure. Our data show that IPv6 hosting outperforms legacy IPv4 paths in mobile Web. Our analysis leads to clear recommendations for CPs to transition to IPv6-hosted mobile Web. Finally, we propose new mechanisms, through which CDNs can safely transition mobile content to IPv6-enabled servers for improved content delivery.

An in-depth understanding of multipath TCP on mobile devices: measurement and system design
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Today's mobile devices are usually equipped with multiple wireless network interfaces that provide new opportunities for improving application performance. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of multipath for mobile settings, focusing on MPTCP, with the goal of developing key insights for evolving the mobile multipath design. First, we conduct to our knowledge the most in-depth and the longest user trial of mobile multipath that focuses not only on MPTCP performance, but also on cross-layer interactions. Second, we identify a new research problem of multipath-aware CDN server selection. We demonstrate its real-world importance and provide recommendations. Third, our measurement findings lead us to design and implement a flexible software architecture for mobile multipath called MPFlex, which strategically employs multiplexing to improve multipath performance (by up to 63% for short-lived flows). MPFlex decouples the high-level scheduling algorithm and the low-level OS protocol implementation, and enables developers to flexibly plug-in new multipath features. MPFlex also provides an ideal vantage point for flexibly realizing user-specified multipath policies and is friendly to middleboxes.

3D real-time indoor localization via broadband nonlinear backscatter in passive devices with centimeter precision
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
We propose and demonstrate accurate 3D real-time indoor localization via broadband nonlinear backscatter in passive devices. The proposed method does not need any relative motion between a reader and a tag or the use of reference anchor nodes. In the conventional radio frequency identification (RFID) system, a passive tag responds to a reader by switching its antenna "on" and "off". The operation of such conventional backscatter is essentially "linear", since the reader-to-tag (downlink) and tag-to-reader (uplink) signals overlap on the same carrier frequency. Although linear backscatter is straightforward, the self-jamming problem caused by strong leakage signals from the transmitter to the receiver is notorious and poses many constraints on the received signal quality, operation bandwidth, modulation flexibility and system complexity. To enable high-accuracy real-time 3D indoor localization for passive devices, we show that nonlinear backscatter is more effective than linear backscatter. Nonlinear backscatter exploits nonlinear elements in passive devices to generate second or higher-order harmonics as the uplink response. Separation of downlink and uplink on different carriers allows immediate self-jamming cancellation and direct un-modulated carrier phase decoding, hence resulting in better received signal quality and broad bandwidth of operation, both of which are critical for the localization system. The broad bandwidth allows the design of an efficient phase-based ranging algorithm - heuristic multi-frequency continuous wave (HMFCW) ranging which resolves ambiguous phase cycles with heuristically optimized sparse carrier frequencies. HMFCW ranging can correctly pin down the phase cycle integer with 100% reliability as long as the phase error falls within &plusmn;90&deg; &times; BW% (percentage bandwidth). In our present implementation, we achieved a median ranging error below 1 cm under phase error bounds of &plusmn;50&deg;. We realized real-time 3D localization from differential ranging by nonlinear conjugate gradient (CG) search for hyperboloids intersection in a multi-static transceiving system with 1 Tx antenna and 4 Rx antennas. The measured 3D localization median error was 3.5 cm in the indoor environment. Presently, the measurement latency was less than 0.155 seconds. We will present system design, algorithms and a prototype with experimental evaluation.

LiTell: robust indoor localization using unmodified light fixtures
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Owing to dense deployment of light fixtures and multipath-free propagation, visible light localization technology holds potential to overcome the reliability issue of radio localization. However, existing visible light localization systems require customized light hardware, which increases deployment cost and hinders near term adoption. In this paper, we propose LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency ( &gt; 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. Our experiments demonstrate LiTell's high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and its potential to achieve sub-meter location granularity. Our user study in a multi-storey office building, parking lot and grocery store further validates LiTell as an accurate, robust and ready-to-use indoor localization system.

LiFS: low human-effort, device-free localization with fine-grained subcarrier information
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Device-free localization of people and objects indoors not equipped with radios is playing a critical role in many emerging applications. This paper presents an accurate model-based device-free localization system LiFS, implemented on cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices. Unlike previous COTS device-based work, LiFS is able to localize a target accurately without offline training. The basic idea is simple: channel state information (CSI) is sensitive to a target's location and by modelling the CSI measurements of multiple wireless links as a set of power fading based equations, the target location can be determined. However, due to rich multipath propagation indoors, the received signal strength (RSS) or even the fine-grained CSI can not be easily modelled. We observe that even in a rich multipath environment, not all subcarriers are affected equally by multipath reflections. Our pre-processing scheme tries to identify the subcarriers not affected by multipath. Thus, CSIs on the "clean" subcarriers can be utilized for accurate localization. We design, implement and evaluate LiFS with extensive experiments in three different environments. Without knowing the majority transceivers' locations, LiFS achieves a median accuracy of 0.5 m and 1.1 m in line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art systems. Besides single target localization, LiFS is able to differentiate two sparsely-located targets and localize each of them at a high accuracy.

Experience: accurate simulation of dense scenarios with hundreds of vehicular transmitters
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
This paper reports on our methodology and experience from a multi-year effort to cross-validate a vehicular network experiment with four hundred Dedicated Short Range Communications IEEE 802.11p transmitters through ns-3 simulations. With most of these transmitters in communication range, this represents an extremely dense wireless configuration that challenges radio and interference models. Field test and simulations were conducted in tandem and iteratively to facilitate model selection and configuration as well as to allow a detailed evaluation of simulation accuracy. We have learned that 1) results were most sensitive to parameter choices in the propagation and receiver models, with simulator default parameters not providing a good match; 2) results could, however, be significantly improved by adapting, implementing, and calibrating the propagation models and receiver models from the literature, yielding 88% accuracy (in terms of packet error rate compared to the field test) in such a complex large-scale setting; 3) the process was helpful in identifying errors both in the simulation models and in the experimental code and points to opportunities for further research.

Tracking drone orientation with multiple GPS receivers
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Inertial sensors continuously track the 3D orientation of a flying drone, serving as the bedrock for maneuvers and stabilization. However, even the best inertial measurement units (IMU) are prone to various types of correlated failures. We consider using multiple GPS receivers on the drone as a fail-safe mechanism for IMU failures. The core challenge is in accurately computing the relative locations between each receiver pair, and translating these measurements into the drone's 3D orientation. Achieving IMU-like orientation requires the relative GPS distances to be accurate to a few centimeters -- a difficult task given that GPS today is only accurate to around 1-4 meters. Moreover, GPS-based orientation needs to be precise even under sharp drone maneuvers, GPS signal blockage, and sudden bouts of missing data. This paper designs SafetyNet, an off-the-shelf GPS-only system that addresses these challenges through a series of techniques, culminating in a novel particle filter framework running over multi-GNSS systems (GPS, GLONASS, and SBAS). Results from 11 sessions of 5-7 minute flights report median orientation accuracies of 2&deg; even under overcast weather conditions. Of course, these improvements arise from an increase in cost due to the multiple GPS receivers, however, when safety is of interest, we believe that tradeoff is worthwhile.

DopEnc: acoustic-based encounter profiling using smartphones
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2016
This paper presents DopEnc, an acoustic-based encounter profiling system on smartphones. DopEnc can automatically identify the persons that users interact with in the context of encountering. DopEnc performs encounter profiling in two major steps: (1) Doppler profiling to detect that two persons approach and stop in front of each other via an effective trajectory, and (2) voice profiling to confirm that they are thereafter engaged in an interactive conversation. DopEnc is further extended to support parallel acoustic exploration of many users by incorporating a unique multiple access scheme within the limited inaudible acoustic frequency band. All implementation of DopEnc is based on commodity sensors like speakers, microphones and accelerometers integrated on commercial-off-the-shelf smartphones. We evaluate DopEnc with detailed experiments and a real use-case study of 11 participants. Overall DopEnc achieves an accuracy of 6.9% false positive and 9.7% false negative in real usage.

RnB: rate and brightness adaptation for rate-distortion-energy tradeoff in HTTP adaptive streaming over mobile devices
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Video streaming is a prevalent mobile service that drains a significant amount of battery power. While various efforts have been made toward saving both video transfer and display energy, they are independently designed in an ad-hoc way and thereby can cause some non-apparent yet critical performance issues. To fill in this gap, this paper presents a fundamentally new design by jointly considering the end-to-end pipeline from the initial video encoding to the final mobile display. In essence, we shift the classic R-D tradeoff that has governed streaming system designs for decades to a fresh rate-distortion-energy (R-D-E) tradeoff specifically tailored for mobile devices. We present RnB, a video bitrate and display brightness adaptation platform that is standard-compliant, backward compatible, and device-neutral in order to achieve the proposed R-D-E tradeoff. RnB is empowered by some new discovery about the inherent relationship among bitrate, display brightness, and video quality as well as by an control-theoretic formulation to dynamically adapt the bitrate and scale the display brightness. Experimental results based on real-time implementation show that RnB can achieve an average of 19% energy reduction with final video quality comparable to conventional R-D based schemes.

LEO: scheduling sensor inference algorithms across heterogeneous mobile processors and network resources
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Mobile apps that use sensors to monitor user behavior often employ resource heavy inference algorithms that make computational offloading a common practice. However, existing schedulers/offloaders typically emphasize one primary offloading aspect without fully exploring complementary goals (e.g., heterogeneous resource management with only partial visibility into underlying algorithms, or concurrent sensor app execution on a single resource) and as a result, may overlook performance benefits pertinent to sensor processing. We bring together key ideas scattered in existing offloading solutions to build LEO -- a scheduler designed to maximize the performance for the unique workload of continuous and intermittent mobile sensor apps without changing their inference accuracy. LEO makes use of domain specific signal processing knowledge to smartly distribute the sensor processing tasks across the broader range of heterogeneous computational resources of high-end phones (CPU, co-processor, GPU and the cloud). To exploit short-lived, but substantial optimization opportunities, and remain responsive to the needs of near real-time apps such as voice-based natural user interfaces, LEO runs as a service on a low-power co-processor unit (LPU) to perform both frequent and joint schedule optimization for concurrent pipelines. Depending on the workload and network conditions, LEO is between 1.6 and 3 times more energy efficient than conventional cloud offloading with CPU-bound sensor sampling. In addition, even if a general-purpose scheduler is optimized directly to leverage an LPU, we find LEO still uses only a fraction (&lt; 1/7) of the energy overhead for scheduling and is up to 19% more energy efficient for medium to heavy workloads.

Lasagna: towards deep hierarchical understanding and searching over mobile sensing data
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
The proliferation of mobile devices has enabled extensive mobile-data supported applications, e.g., exercise and activity recognition and quantification. Typically, these applications need predefined features and are only applicable to predefined activities. In this work, we address the issue of deep understanding of arbitrary activities and semantic searching of any activity over massive mobile sensing data. The challenges stem from the rich dynamics and the wide-spectrum of activities that a human being could perform. We propose a hierarchical activity representation, extract common bases of motion data in an unsupervised manner by leveraging the power of deep neural networks, and propose a universal multi-resolution representation for all activities without prior knowledge. Based on this representation, we design an innovative system Lasagna to manage and search motion data semantically. We implement a prototype system and our comprehensive evaluations show that our system can achieve highly accurate activity classification (with precision 98.9%) and search (with recall almost 100% and precision about 90%) over a diverse set of activities.

SPREE: a spoofing resistant GPS receiver
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Global Positioning System (GPS) is used ubiquitously in a wide variety of applications ranging from navigation and tracking to modern smart grids and communication networks. However, it has been demonstrated that modern GPS receivers are vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks. For example, today it is possible to change the course of a ship or force a drone to land in a hostile area by simply spoofing GPS signals. Several countermeasures have been proposed in the past to detect GPS spoofing attacks. These counter-measures offer protection only against naive attackers. They are incapable of detecting strong attackers such as those capable of seamlessly taking over a GPS receiver, which is currently receiving legitimate satellite signals, and spoofing them to an arbitrary location. Also, there is no hardware platform that can be used to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of existing countermeasures in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present SPREE, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first GPS receiver capable of detecting all spoofing attacks described in the literature. Our novel spoofing detection technique called auxiliary peak tracking enables detection of even a strong attacker capable of executing the seamless takeover attack. We implement and evaluate our receiver against three different sets of GPS signal traces: (i) a public repository of spoofing traces, (ii) signals collected through our own wardriving effort and (iii) using commercial GPS signal generators. Our evaluations show that SPREE constraints even a strong attacker (capable of seamless takeover attack) from spoofing the receiver to a location not more than 1 km away from its true location. This is a significant improvement over modern GPS receivers that can be spoofed to any arbitrary location. Finally, we release our implementation and datasets to the community for further research and development.

Appstract: on-the-fly app content semantics with better privacy
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Services like Google Now on Tap and Bing Snapp enable new user experiences by understanding the semantics of contents that users consume in their apps. These systems send contents of currently displayed app pages to the cloud to identify relevant entities (e.g., a movie) appearing in the current page and show information related to such entities (e.g., local theaters playing the movie). These new experiences come with privacy concerns as they can send sensitive on-screen data (bank details, medical data, etc.) to the cloud. We propose a novel approach that efficiently extracts app content semantics on the device, without exfiltrating user data. Our solution consists of two phases: an offline, user-agnostic, in-cloud phase that automatically annotates apps' UI elements with stable semantics, and a lightweight on-device phase that assigns semantics to captured app contents on the fly, by matching the annotations. With this automatic approach we annotated 100+ food, dining, and music apps, with accuracy over 80%. Our system implementation for Android and Windows Phone---Appstract---incurs minimal runtime overhead. We built eight use cases on the Appstract framework.

Investigation of multi-device location spoofing attacks on air traffic control and possible countermeasures
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Multilateration techniques have been proposed to verify the integrity of unprotected location claims in wireless localization systems. A common assumption is that the adversary is equipped with only a single device from which it transmits location spoofing signals. In this paper, we consider a more advanced model where the attacker is equipped with multiple devices and performs a geographically distributed coordinated attack on the multilateration system. The feasibility of a distributed multi-device attack is demonstrated experimentally with a self-developed attack implementation based on multiple COTS software-defined radio (SDR) devices. We launch an attack against the OpenSky Network, an air traffic surveillance system that implements a time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) multi-lateration method for aircraft localization based on ADS-B signals. Our experiments show that the timing errors for distributed spoofed signals are indistinguishable from the multilateration errors of legitimate aircraft signals, indicating that the threat of multi-device spoofing attacks is real in this and other similar systems. In the second part of this work, we investigate physical-layer features that could be used to detect multi-device attacks. We show that the frequency offset and transient phase noise of the attacker's radio devices can be exploited to discriminate between a received signal that has been transmitted by a single (legitimate) transponder or by multiple (malicious) spoofing sources. Based on that, we devise a multi-device spoofing detection system that achieves zero false positives and a false negative rate below 1%.

MASHaBLE: mobile applications of secret handshakes over bluetooth LE
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2016
We present new applications for cryptographic secret handshakes between mobile devices on top of Bluetooth Low-Energy (LE). Secret handshakes enable mutual authentication, with the property that the parties learn nothing about each other unless they have been both issued credentials by a group administrator. This property provides strong privacy guarantees that enable interesting applications. One of them is proximity-based discovery for private communities. We introduce MASHaBLE, a mobile application that enables participants to discover and interact with nearby users if and only if they belong to the same secret community. We use direct peer-to-peer communication over Bluetooth LE, rather than relying on a central server. We discuss the specifics of implementing secret handshakes over Bluetooth LE and present our prototype implementation.

SALVE: server authentication with location verification
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
The Location Service (LCS) proposed by the telecommunication industry is an architecture that allows the location of mobile devices to be accessed in various applications. We explore the use of LCS in location-enhanced server authentication, which traditionally relies on certificates. Given recent incidents involving certificate authorities, various techniques to strengthen server authentication were proposed. They focus on improving the certificate validation process, such as pinning, revocation, or multi-path probing. In this paper, we propose using the server's geographic location as a second factor of its authenticity. Our solution, SALVE, achieves location-based server authentication by using secure DNS resolution and by leveraging LCS for location measurements. We develop a TLS extension that enables the client to verify the server's location in addition to its certificate. Successful server authentication therefore requires a valid certificate and the server's presence at a legitimate geographic location, e.g., on the premises of a data center. SALVE prevents server impersonation by remote adversaries with mis-issued certificates or stolen private keys of the legitimate server. We develop a prototype implementation and our evaluation in real-world settings shows that it incurs minimal impact to the average server throughput. Our solution is backward compatible and can be integrated with existing approaches for improving server authentication in TLS.

Android malware has been found on various third-party online markets, which poses drastic threats to mobile users in terms of security and privacy. Machine learning is one of the promising approaches to discriminate the malicious applications from the benign ones. Despite its higher malware detection capability, a significant challenge remains: in adversarial environment, an attacker can adapt by maximally sabotaging classifiers by polluting training data. This paper proposes KuafuDet, a two-phase learning enhancing approach that adversarially detects the Android malware. Experiments on more than 50,000 Android applications demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.

We carefully design and implement our protocol, Martian, which allows smooth communication from the LED lights to a group of camera-enabled mobile devices. Across several phone models, Martian can achieve data rate of about 1.6kbps even with NLOS-light. Our intensive evaluations indicate that, the data rate reaches 4.2kbps on iPhone 6. This is a significant improvement compared with the 88bps data rate claimed by state-of-art design.

Poster: A millimeter wave software defined radio platform with phased arrays
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Recently, there has been significant interest in performing research on millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. However, there do not exist any mmWave radio platforms with phased arrays available to the networking community. All existing mmWave platforms use horn antennas which require mechanical steering and are not suitable for non-static links or multi-user networks. We have built MiRa: a full-fledged mmWave radio with phased arrays capable of beam steering. MiRa operates as a daughterboard for the USRP software radio which enables easy manipulation of mmWave signals using standard GNU-radio software. With its reconfigurable architecture, steerable phased arrays and open SDR platform, MiRa can help advance mmWave research in the mobile and networking community.

Sensing on ubiquitous surfaces via vibration signals: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
This work explores vibration-based sensing to determine the location of a touch on extended surface areas as well as identify the object touching the surface leveraging a single sensor. It supports a broad array of applications through either passive or active sensing using only a single sensor. In the passive sensing, the received vibration signals are determined by the location of the touch impact. This allows location discrimination of touches precise enough to enable emerging applications such as virtual keyboards on ubiquitous surfaces for mobile devices. Moreover, in the active mode, the received vibration signals carry richer information of the touching object's characteristics (e.g., weight, size, location and material). This further enables our work to match the signals to the trained profiles and allows it to differentiate personal objects in contact with any surface. We evaluated extensively in the use cases of localizing touches (i.e., virtual keyboards), object localization and identification. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed vibration-based solution can achieve high accuracy, over 95%, in all these use cases.

PIN number-based authentication leveraging physical vibration: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2016
In this work, we propose the first PIN number based authentication system, which can be deployed on ubiquitous surfaces, leveraging physical vibration signals. The proposed system aims to integrate PIN number, behavioral and physiological characteristics together to provide enhanced security. Different from the existing password-based approaches, the proposed system builds upon a touch sensing technique using vibration signals that can operate on any solid surface. In this poster, we explore the feasibility of using vibration signals for ubiquitous user authentication and develop algorithms that identify fine-grained finger inputs with different password secrets (e.g., PIN sequences). We build a prototype using a vibration transceiver that can be attached to any surface (e.g., a door or a desk) easily. Our experiments in office environments with multiple users demonstrate that we can achieve high authentication accuracy with a low false negative rate.

Due to the popularity of soccer and the purposeful use of the head during play, traumatic brain injury to soccer players has been a concern for decades. However, there is a sense of urgency now in understanding and preventing concussions better, due to raising public awareness. Towards that end, intra-oral devices such as Vector MouthGuards are being studied [3] to measure the athlete's head's linear and rotational accelerations from impacts experienced in practices and games. But given the players' natural distaste for such intra-oral devices, more palatable alternatives for head impact monitoring are being developed [2]. X2 Biosystems xPatchis an electronic skin patch thatis worn behind the ear. Reebok Checklight embeds the impact sensor in the back of a skullcap which can be worn with or without a helmet. Triax SIM-P is placed inside a headband for non-helmeted sports and a skullcap for helmeted sports. While all these devices are much more convenient to wear than intra-oral devices, it is yet to be seen whether they gain wider acceptance, particularly by the millions of amateur soccer players all over the world.

A mobility prediction system leveraging realtime location data streams: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Location-based services today, exceedingly depend on user mobility prediction, in order to push context aware services ahead of time. Existing location forecasting techniques are driven by large volumes of data to train the prediction models in a centralised server. This amounts to considerably long waiting times before the model kicks in. Disclosing highly sensitive location information to third party entities also exposes the user to several privacy risks. To address these issues, we put forth a mobility prediction system, able to provide swift realtime predictions, evading the strenuous training procedure. We enable this by constantly adapting the model to substantive user mobility behaviours that facilitate accurate predictions even on marginal time bounded movements. In comparison to existing frameworks, we utilise less volumes of data to produce satisfactory prediction accuracies. This in turn lowers the computational complexity making implementation on mobile devices feasible and a step towards privacy preservation. Here, only the predicted location can be sent to such services to maintain the utility/privacy tradeoff. Our preliminary evaluations based on real world mobility traces corroborate our hypothesis.

Migrating running applications across mobile edge clouds: poster

Mobile edge clouds (MECs) are small cloud-like infrastructures deployed in close proximity to users, allowing users to have seamless and low-latency access to cloud services. When users move across different locations, their service applications often need to be migrated to follow the user so that the benefit of MEC is maintained. In this paper, we propose a layered framework for migrating running applications that are encapsulated either in virtual machines (VMs) or containers. We evaluate the migration performance of various real applications under the proposed framework.

Low-cost wireless phase calibration that works on COTS RFID systems: poster

2016
This paper introduces a wireless phase calibration algorithm that can be applied on cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) radio frequency identification (RFID) system and auto acquire an accurate radio frequency (RF) phase information without any offline training. The key observation is that the raw phase measurements even measured form different RFID tags contain a same set of unknown phase errors. With enough tags' phase measurements, we can determine all the unknown phase errors, since the number of known phase measurements is much larger than the number of unknown phase errors. Real-world experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper introduces GonioSense -- a wearable based system that can track and measure both active and passive joint motions. GonioSense leverages embedded inertial sensors to provide reliable and consistent measurement results. A key challenge for our system is how to efficiently detect body movement and accurately calculate range of joint motion. We built a preliminary version that can collect and analyze sensor data in real time on the Android platform. To test the system, we recruited five healthy volunteers and measured six kinds of joint motions. The same tools used by physical therapists, measurements gathered from a goniometer and an inclinometer is what we used as the ground truth data for calibrations and evaluation of our algorithm. In the initial version, GonioSense estimation errors are within &plusmn; 5% for more than 80% cases. By utilizing wearable technology, the benefits for both doctors and patients could bring forth an immense step forward in physical therapy treatment.

2016
Usage of WiFi is becoming increasingly popular in public wireless LAN (WLAN) settings like malls, airports and train stations. Similarly to other prominent examples of WiFi usage like enterprise and home settings, public WLANs could also benefit from an SDN-based coordinated management framework that deals with issues like interference and mobility management. However, unlike these settings, public WLANs present a few differences in their characteristics, such as the need to offer location-aware services and dynamic categorization of users, and the consequent need to provide sophisticated association strategies. Motivated by this we propose VALI, an SDN management framework tailored to meet the needs of public WLAN settings. We give an overview of VALI and present initial results obtained using our prototype implementation deployed over a testbed that resembles a realistic public WLAN environment. Our results demonstrate that VALI is a promising solution that could be used to effectively manage public WLAN settings and enable location-aware WiFi access.

Semantic localization refers to the process of finding one's location with respect to visible or identifiable objects in the scene instead of finding position coordinates. In this research, we use textual signs and their geographical relationships inside a building as semantic signatures to design an infrastructureless indoor navigation system without a site survey. We propose a computer vision-based approach, which takes as an input a floor plan image and automatically infers the floor graph. The constructed graph is then used to estimate the shortest path, which is a sequence of store names, that the user needs to pass to reach her destination.

Do open resources encourage entry into the millimeter wave cellular service market?: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
The resource usage model for millimeter wave bands has been the subject of considerable debate. The massive bandwidth, highly directional antennas, high penetration loss and susceptibility to shadowing in these bands suggest certain advantages to spectrum and infrastructure sharing. In particular, resources that are "open", such as unlicensed spectrum or a deployment of base stations open to all service providers, may offer greater gains in mmWave bands than at conventional cellular frequencies. However, even when sharing is technically beneficial (as recent research in this area suggests that it is), it may not be profitable. In this paper, both the technical and economic implications of resource sharing in millimeter wave networks are studied. Millimeter wave service is considered in the economic framework of a network good, and detailed network simulations are used to understand data rates, profit, and demand for millimeter wave service, with and without open resources. The results suggest that "open" deployments of neutral small cells that serve subscribers of any service provider encourage market entry by making it easier for networks to reach critical mass, more than "open" (unlicensed) spectrum would.

In some special circumstances, such as earthquakes, tsunamis and floods, etc. Infrastructure communication facilities are damaged, all communications are interrupted. For the communication between peoples, Android smartphones can be used to construct Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). To improve the work efficiency, it is necessary to run the Information Systems (Android Applications) in MANETs, therefore the distribution of information becomes convenient. However, it is very hard to get a real MANET environment to test Android Applications, and so far, we have not found any MANETs simulation environments which can be used to test actual Android Applications. Therefore, we propose a Simulation Experimental Environment for Android Applications in MANETs (SEEM). The test results show that the SEEM is practicable to test Android Applications in MANETs. We believe that the SEEM will be beneficial to the researchers and developers who need to develop and test actual Android Applications in MANETs.

Cell tower extension through drones: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2016
Internet connectivity on mobile devices is an essential commodity in today's world. While outdoors, most people connect through cellphone towers on 3G or 4G. However, cellphone tower coverage is not uniform and is affected by electromagnetic shadows cast by large structures, multipath, and absorption by various surfaces. Users with high data needs suffer in such locations due to insufficient network bandwidth. A similar insufficiency can also be felt by flash crowds in locations with otherwise moderate signal strength due to division of the available bandwidth. We explore the possibility of using drones as a solution to this problem. The drones can hover with direct line of sight with a cellphone tower and extend cellular coverage into the weaker regions. Our idea is to use the knowledge of large structures in the area to compute the expected SNR space around the client's current location. We use ray-tracing techniques to compute the expected SNR in an area. We then verify its similarity with ground truth by measuring, at several locations on the ground, the received signal strength from a Wifi router on a drone.

EasyGuard: enhanced context-aware adaptive access control system for android platform: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2016
Applications in Android often have the ability of accessing sensitive resources on mobile devices. These resources have different levels of security and usage constraint in scenarios which have different requirements for privacy. Therefore, it is in demand for users to have fine-grained privacy protection and resources usage constraint that taking the context information into account, which is not supported by inherent access control mechanism of Android. To address these issues, we designed and implemented an enhanced context-aware adaptive access control system (EasyGuard) in Android to provide adaptive access control automatically when the specific context is detected according to the pre-configured policies. In addition, we developed an application to facilitate users that have little domain knowledge in android to configure policies reasonably. Experimental results show that users can easily protect their privacy, security and save energy of mobile devices through this system.

Harnessing spectrum awareness to enhance mobile computing: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
The well documented growth in mobile traffic is mainly driven by increasingly sophisticated smart phone applications. Simultaneously, user preference for lighter phones has resulted in more battery power constrained hand-helds that offload computations to resource intensive cloud. This second trend exacerbates the bandwidth crunch often experienced over wireless networks. Our idea (joint cognitive offloading and scheduling) is to use dynamic spectrum access and management concepts from wireless networking to effect computation offloading and scheduling solutions that achieves near optimal trade-offs between the mobile device and wireless resources. We use all radio available interfaces (e.g. WiFi, LTE) in multi-RAT enabled devices to schedule appropriate components of the application to run either on the mobile device or on the resource-rich cloud, while staying adaptive to the conditions of the wireless network.

A transfer kernel learning based strategy for adaptive localization in dynamic indoor environments: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2016
Existing WiFi fingerprinting-based Indoor Positioning System (IPS) suffers from the vulnerability of environmental dynamics. To address this issue, we propose TKL-WinSMS as a systematic strategy, which is able to realize robust and adaptive localization in dynamic indoor environments. We developed a WiFi-based Non-intrusive Sensing and Monitoring System (WinSMS) that enables COTS WiFi routers as online reference points by extracting real-time RSS readings among them. With these online data and labeled source data from the offline calibrated radio map, we further combine the RSS readings from target mobile devices as unlabeled target data, to design a robust localization model using an emerging transfer learning algorithm, namely transfer kernel learning (TKL). It can learn a domain-invariant kernel by directly matching the source and target distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space instead of the raw noisy signal space. By leveraging the resultant kernel as input for the SVR training, the trained localization model can inherit the information from online phase to adaptively enhance the offline calibrated radio map. Extensive experimental results verify the superiority of TKL-WinSMS in terms of localization accuracy compared with existing solutions in dynamic indoor environments.

Then the MSN enhances endpoint mobility by a clean separation of identity and logical network location through an identity-to-location resolution service, and taking full advantage of the user's geographical location information. Moreover, a SDN based implementation is presented to further illustrate the proposal.

Cross-layer MAC/PHY protocol to support IoT traffic in 5G: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
With exponential growth of IoT devices [1], the 5G network will experience a variety of traffic patterns not prevalent in earlier applications. These, often will transmit short sporadic messages, which are not well suited to the connection-oriented modes associated with legacy 3GPP network resulting in high service latency and excessive control overhead. It is acknowledged that current 4G network could be overwhelmed by the surge in both traffic and control plane signaling load. For 5G, it is necessary to redesign the mobile network to provide a low delay, low control overhead IoT mode that will work efficiently for emerging application scenarios. The MAC layer has to be designed in such a way that IoT messages experience low access latency across both the radio access network and core network. The goal is to operate in the same band as current LTE, thus not requiring any separate bandwidth allocation and is backward compatible with the current 4G system. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer MAC and Physical layer solution for low power, low bitrate devices that require low access delay and long range for communication.

CSI feedback reduction by checking its validity period: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) is proposed in 802.11ac to achieve more than 3x faster than 802.11n. In the real world no-one gets close to theoretical speeds. The primary reason for this anomaly are the various overheads of channel access and channel state information (CSI) feedback. In order to achieve concurrent data transmission, (CSI) feedback from users is required. However, this overhead can easily overwhelm the actual channel time spent on data transmission in large-scale network. Moreover, due to spontaneous uplink traffic, which makes the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a smart CSI feedback protocol called Gabriel. Firstly, Gabriel achieves alterable CSI feedback by evaluating its validity period to eliminate the unnecessary CSI feedback operation. Secondly, we introduce a new concept named 'large time slice' to solve fairness problem. Software-radio based implementation and testbed experimentation show that Gabriel significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CSI feedback reduction methods under various traffic patterns and node mobility.

Preserving incumbent users' privacy in exclusion-zone-based spectrum access systems: poster
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2016
Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technique has emerged as a fundamental approach to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem. As a key form of DSA, government is proposing to release more federal spectrum for sharing with commercial wireless users. However, the flourish of federal-commercial sharing hinges upon how the federal privacy is managed. In current DSA proposals, the sensitive exclusion zone (E-Zone) information of federal incumbent users (IUs) needs to be shared with a spectrum access system (SAS) to realize spectrum allocation. However, SAS is not necessarily trust-worthy for holding the sensitive IU E-Zone data, especially considering that FCC allows some industry third parties (e.g., Google) to operate SAS for better efficiency and scalability. Therefore, the current proposals dissatisfy the IUs' privacy requirement. To address the privacy issue, this paper presents an IU-privacy-preserving SAS (IP-SAS) design, which realizes the spectrum allocation process through secure computation over ciphertext based on homomorphic encryption.

The sensing capabilities of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) network are usually fixed at deployment. Adding new sensing modalities is a cumbersome process because it requires altering the deployed hardware. We introduce passive sensor tags that allow to easily and seamlessly add new sensors to existing IoT deployments without requiring hardware modifications or additional energy sources. Passive sensor tags employ backscatter communication to generate transmissions that can be decoded by the radio transceivers present in today's IoT devices. Furthermore, unlike recent works, our approach does not require dedicated infrastructure to generate the unmodulated carrier used for backscatter communication. The demo showcases our prototype of a passive sensor tag collecting sensor data and delivering it to unmodified commodity IoT devices using passive 802.15.4 transmissions.

The resolution process not only affects the customer experience but could also entails cost on customer care and network operations of the mobile service providers.

Owing to dense deployment of light fixtures and multipath-free propagation, visible light localization technology holds potential to overcome the reliability issue of radio localization. However, existing visible light localization systems require customized light hardware, which increases deployment cost and hinders near term adoption. We present LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency, which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency (&gt; 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. In our experiments, LiTell demonstrates high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and great potential to achieve sub-meter granularity.

Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as a new wireless communication technology with appealing benefits not present in radio communication. However, current VLC designs commonly require LED lights to emit perceptible light beams, which greatly limits the applicable scenarios of VLC (e.g., in a sunny day when indoor lighting is not needed), and brings high energy overhead and unpleasant visual experiences for mobile devices to transmit data using VLC. We design and develop DarkLight, a new VLC primitive that allows light-based communication to be sustained even when LEDs emit extremely-low luminance. The key idea is to encode data into ultra-short, imperceptible light pulses. We tackle challenges in circuit designs, data encoding/decoding schemes, and DarkLight networking, to efficiently generate and reliably detect ultra-short light pulses using off-the-shelf, low-cost LEDs and photodiodes. Our DarkLight prototype supports 1.3-m distance with 1.6-Kbps data rate. By loosening up VLC's reliance on visible light beams, DarkLight presents an unconventional direction of VLC and fundamentally broadens VLC's application scenarios.

Device-free gesture tracking using acoustic signals: demo
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
In this demo, we present LLAP, a hand tracking system that uses ultrasound to localize the hand of the user to enable device-free gesture inputs. LLAP utilizes speakers and microphones on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mobile devices to play and record sound waves that are inaudible to humans. By measuring the phase of the sound signal reflected by the hands or fingers of the user, we can accurately measure the gesture movements. With a single pair of speaker/microphone, LLAP can track hand movement with accuracy of 3.5 mm. For devices with two microphones, LLAP enables drawing-in-the air capability with tracking accuracy of 4.6 mm. Moreover, the latency for LLAP is smaller than 15 ms for both the Android and the iOS platforms so that LLAP can be used for real-time applications.

FMNC - rapid and accurate wifi characterization: demo
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
A key part of achieving a reasonable Quality of Experience (QoE) for the mobile user is the ability to properly assess the quality of the available network capacity. Unfortunately, most existing techniques are ill-suited to wireless characterization, either providing fast but grossly inaccurate results or providing accurate results at the cost of time and bandwidth. To meet this need, we developed Fast Mobile Network Characterization (FMNC). FMNC operates within a web fetch and provides an accurate available bandwidth assessment within 250 ms while consuming less than 100 KB of data. In our demo, we will show the mobile clients for FMNC including apps for Android / iOS, the server back end, and a REST API. We will also show visualization of our ongoing longitudinal dataset of nearly one hundred users.

A framework for collaborative sensing and processing of mobile data streams: demo
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Emerging mobile applications involve continuous sensing and complex computations on sensed data streams. Examples include cognitive apps (e.g., speech recognition, natural language translation, as well as face, object, or gesture detection and recognition) and anticipatory apps that proactively track and provide services when needed. Unfortunately, today's mobile devices cannot keep pace with such apps, despite advances in hardware capability. Traditional approaches address this problem by computation offloading. One approach offloads by sending sensed streams to remote cloud servers via cellular networks or to cloudlets via Wi-Fi, where a clone of the app runs [2, 3, 4]. However, cloudlets may not be widely deployed and access to cloud infrastructure may yield high network delays and can be intermittent due to mobility. Morever, users might hesitate to upload private sensing data to the cloud or cloudlet. A second approach offloads to accelerators by rewriting code to use DSP or GPU within mobile devices. However, using accelerators requires substantial programming effort and produces varied benefits for diverse codes on heterogeneous devices.

VibKeyboard: virtual keyboard leveraging physical vibration: demo
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
VibKeyboard could accurately determine the location of a keystroke on extended surface areas leveraging a single vibration sensor. Unlike capacitive sensing, it does not require conductive materials and compared to audio sensing it is more robust to acoustic noise. In VibKeyboard, the received vibration signals are determined by the location of the touch impact. This allows location discrimination of touches precise enough to enable emerging applications such as virtual keyboards on ubiquitous surfaces for mobile devices. VibKeyboard seeks to extract unique features in frequency domain embedded in the vibration signal attenuation and interference and perform fine grained localization. Our experimental results demonstrate that VibKeyboard could accurately recognize keystrokes from close-by keys on a nearby virtual keyboard.

HearHere: smartphone based audio localization using time difference of arrival: demo
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
Recent advancements in audio recording on mobile devices have improved audio localization capabilities using phones. Previous research has shown that millimeter level accuracy is capable using an off-the-shelf smartphone. This work demonstrates that such valuable resources in smartphones are readily available for developing consumer applications. We develop a smartphone application called HearHere that utilizes geometric features of sound to categorize a tapping sound within a grid. The geometric features are based on the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) of the sound between two microphones. By using this classification, any off the shelf phone with stereo recording capability can be made into a music producing device. The application consists of three major components: system calibration, data collection, and audio localization engine based on TDoA. We demonstrate that we can accurately map the tapping sound six region on various solid surface and turn it into a MIDI controller with six different types of instruments.

WiART - visualize and interact with wireless networks using augmented reality: demo
Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking
None
2016
With the increasing programmability and fast-paced dynamics of modern wireless systems, it has become more difficult to gain timely insights into wireless network operations. In this demonstration1 we present WiART, an augmented reality framework to help visualize and interact with wireless network activities in real time. WiART collects real-time radio and network statistics from participating network devices and depicts them on users' mobile devices in an intuitive way, leveraging the virtual information overlay of augmented reality. Specifically in our current implementation, WiART takes inputs from a cognitive radio link controlling beam-steerable reconfigurable antennas and annotates on a live mobile screen the active pre-measured radiation patterns. In the reverse flow, WiART enables users to select desired antenna radiation patterns directly in the mobile app and observe their effects on link performance in real time. These capabilities add an unprecedented level of instant visualization and interaction with wireless activities and provides valuable insights into the dynamics of a reconfigurable antenna-based cognitive radio network.
