Improved interval-based clock synchronization in sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Interval-based synchronization provides the nodes of a distributed system with guaranteed bounds on a common time. This is a crucial piece of infrastructure in many distributed sensing and actuating systems. We propose a modification to a known interval-based synchronization algorithm; our new algorithm obtains substantially better results in sensor-network scenarios by taking advantage of the typical drift diversity of the nodes' clocks. We propose a model for synchronization in ad-hoc, sporadic-communication scenarios. The model allows us to identify the worst and the best case in terms of achievable time uncertainty and to show the worst-case optimality of the discussed algorithms. Simulations show that in the average case, our modification significantly reduces the time uncertainty.

Design of a wireless sensor network platform for detecting rare, random, and ephemeral events
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
We present the design of the extreme scale mote, a new sensor network platform for reliably detecting and classifying, and quickly reporting, rare, random, and ephemeral events in a large-scale, long-lived, and ret askable manner. This new mote was designed for the ExScal project which seeks to demonstrate a 10,000 node network capable of discriminating civilians, soldiers and vehicles, spread out over a 10 km/sup 2/ area, with node lifetimes approaching 1,000 hours of continuous operation on two AA alkaline batteries. This application posed unique functional, usability, scalability, and robustness requirements which could not be met with existing hardware, and therefore motivated the design of a new platform. The detection and classification requirements are met using infrared, magnetic, and acoustic sensors. The infrared and acoustic sensors are designed for low-power continuous operation and include asynchronous processor wakeup circuitry. The usability and scalability requirements are met by minimizing the frequency and cost of human-in-the-loop operations during node deployment, activation, and verification through improvements in the user interface, packaging, and configurability of the platform. Recoverable retasking is addressed by using a grenade timer that periodically forces a system reset. The key contributions of this work are a specific design point and general design methods for building sensor network platforms to detect exceptional events.

Decentralized compression and predistribution via randomized gossiping
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Developing energy efficient strategies for the extraction, transmission, and dissemination of information is a core theme in wireless sensor network research. In this paper we present a novel system for decentralized data compression and predistribution. The system simultaneously computes random projections of the sensor data and disseminates them throughout the network using a simple gossiping algorithm. These summary statistics are stored in an efficient manner and can be extracted from a small subset of nodes anywhere in the network. From these measurements one can reconstruct an accurate approximation of the data at all nodes in the network, provided the original data is compressible in a certain sense which need not be known to the nodes ahead of time. The system provides a practical and universal approach to decentralized compression and content distribution in wireless sensor networks. Two example applications, network health monitoring and field estimation, demonstrate the utility of our method

Blind Calibration of Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
This paper considers the problem of blindly calibrating sensor response using routine sensor network measurements. We show that as long as the sensors slightly oversample the signals of interest, then unknown sensor gains can be perfectly recovered. Remarkably, neither a controlled stimulus nor a dense deployment is required. We also characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for the identification of unknown sensor offsets. Our results exploit incoherence conditions between the basis for the signals and the canonical or natural basis for the sensor measurements. Practical algorithms for gain and offset identification are proposed based on the singular value decomposition and standard least squares techniques. We investigate the robustness of the proposed algorithms to model mismatch and noise on both simulated data and on data from current sensor network deployments.

Sensor Selection for Minimizing Worst-Case Prediction Error
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
We study the problem of choosing the "best" subset of k sensors to sample from among a sensor deployment of n &gt; k sensors, in order to predict aggregate functions over all the sensor values. The sensor data being measured are assumed to be spatially correlated, in the sense that the values at two sensors can differ by at most a monotonically increasing, concave function of their distance. The goal is then to select a subset of sensors so as to minimize the prediction error, assuming that the actual values at unsampled sensors are worst-case subject to the constraints imposed by their distances from sampled sensors. Even selecting sensors for the optimal prediction of the mean, maximum or minimum is NP-hard; we present approximation algorithms to select near-optimal subsets of k sensors that minimize the worst-case prediction error. In general, we show that for any aggregate function satisfying certain concavity, symmetry and monotonicity conditions, the sensor selection problem can be modeled as a k-median clustering problem, and solved using efficient approximation algorithms designed for k-median clustering. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments on two real-world sensor data sets; our experiments confirm that our algorithms lead to prediction errors that are usually less than the (normalized) standard deviation of the test data, using only around 10% of the sensors.

Greedy routing with guaranteed delivery using Ricci flows
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
Greedy forwarding with geographical locations in a wireless sensor network may fail at a local minimum. In this paper we propose to use conformal mapping to compute a new embedding of the sensor nodes in the plane such that greedy forwarding with the virtual coordinates guarantees delivery. In particular, we extract a planar triangulation of the sensor network with non-triangular faces as holes, by either using the nodes' location or using a landmark-based scheme without node location. The conformal map is computed with Ricci flow such that all the non-triangular faces are mapped to perfect circles. Thus greedy forwarding will never get stuck at an intermediate node. The computation of the conformal map and the virtual coordinates is performed at a preprocessing phase and can be implemented by local gossip-style computation. The method applies to both unit disk graph models and quasi-unit disk graph models. Simulation results are presented for these scenarios.

The SensorFly is a novel, low-cost, miniature (29g) controlled-mobile aerial sensor networking platform. Mobility permits a network of SensorFly nodes, unlike fixed networks, to be autonomous in deployment, maintenance and adapting to the environment, as required for emergency response situations such as fire monitoring or survivor search. We demonstrate the ability of the SensorFly system to collaboratively sense the environment (floor temperature) in a demonstration scenario. The SensorFly nodes are tasked to explore the area and transmit sensed data back to a base station. The system partitions tasks among SensorFly nodes based on their capabilities (location, sensors, energy) to achieve concurrent and faster coverage. The real-time sensor data is presented to the user on a display terminal at the base station.

SugarMap: Location-less coverage for micro-aerial sensing swarms
2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2013
Micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) swarms are emerging as a new class of mobile sensor networks with many potential applications such as urban surveillance, disaster response, radiation monitoring, etc., where the swarm is tasked with collaboratively covering a hazardous unknown environment. However, efficient collaborative coverage is challenging due to limited individual sensing, computing and communication resources of MAV sensor nodes, and lack of location infrastructure in the unknown application environment. We present SugarMap, a novel system that enables such resource-constrained MAV nodes to achieve efficient sensing coverage. The self-establishing system uses approximate motion models of mobile nodes in conjunction with radio signatures from self-deployed stationary anchor nodes to create a common coverage map. Consequently, the system coordinates node movements to reduce sensing overlap and increase the speed and efficiency of coverage. The system uses particle filters to account for uncertainty in sensors and actuation of MAV nodes, and incorporates redundancy to guarantee coverage. Through large-scale simulations and a real implementation on the SensorFly MAV sensing platform, we show that SugarMap provides better coverage than the existing coverage approaches for MAV swarms.

Bringing up OpenSky: A large-scale ADS-B sensor network for research
IPSN-14 Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2014
Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is one of the key components of the next generation air transportation system. Since ADS-B will become mandatory by 2020 for most airspaces, it is important that aspects such as capacity, applications, and security are investigated by an independent research community. However, large-scale real-world data was previously only accessible to a few closed industrial and governmental groups because it required specialized and expensive equipment. To enable researchers to conduct experimental studies based on real data, we developed OpenSky, a sensor network based on low-cost hardware connected over the Internet. OpenSky is based on off-the-shelf ADS-B sensors distributed to volunteers throughout Central Europe. It covers 720,000 km2, is able to capture more than 30% of the commercial air traffic in Europe, and enables researchers to analyze billions of ADS-B messages. In this paper, we report on the challenges we faced during the development and deployment of this participatory network and the insights we gained over the last two years of operations as a service to academic research groups. We go on to provide real-world insights about the possibilities and limitations of such low-cost sensor networks concerning air traffic surveillance and further applications such as multilateration.

This demonstration presents a user-friendly Web-based platform that supports intuitive remote benchmarking of different indoor localization solutions. It reduces the barriers for experimental evaluation and fair comparison of their performance across a set of testing environments. The platform is aimed at addressing the limitations in the current praxis of publishing indoor localization research evaluated only in local, potentially biased environments. To this end, it provides a holistic support for the benchmarking process offering: (i) multiple pre-collected raw data-traces from different RF technologies, (ii) high-level interface to control remote wireless testbed facilities, and (iii) a set of tools for creating, storing, comparing and visualizing the performance results of multiple indoor localization solutions.

Natural Timestamping Using Powerline Electromagnetic Radiation
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2017
The continuous fluctuation of electric network frequency (ENF) presents a fingerprint indicative of time, which we call natural timestamp. This paper studies the time accuracy of these natural timestamps obtained from powerline electromagnetic radiation (EMR), which is mainly excited by powerline voltage oscillations at the rate of the ENF. However, since the EMR signal is often weak and noisy, extracting the ENF is challenging, especially on resource-limited sensor platforms. We design an efficient EMR conditioning algorithm and evaluate the time accuracy of EMR natural timestamps on two representative classes of IoT platforms - a high-end single-board computer with a customized EMR antenna and a low-end mote with a normal conductor wire acting as EMR antenna. Extensive measurements at five sites in a city, which are away from each other for up to 24 km, show that the high-end and low-end nodes achieve median time errors of about 50 ms and 150 ms, respectively. To demonstrate the use of the EMR natural timestamps, we discuss two applications, namely time recovery and runtime clock verification.

Sensing uncertainty reduction using low complexity actuation
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
The performance of a sensor network may be best judged by the quality of application specific information return. The actual sensing performance of a deployed sensor network depends on several factors which cannot be accounted at design time, such as environmental obstacles to sensing. We propose the use of mobility to overcome the effect of unpredictable environmental influence and to adapt to run time dynamics. Now, mobility with its dependencies such as precise localization and navigation is expensive in terms of hardware resources and energy constraints, and may not be feasible in compact, densely deployed and widespread sensor nodes. We present a method based on low complexity and low energy actuation primitives which are feasible for implementation in sensor networks. We prove how these primitives improve the detection capabilities with theoretical analysis, extensive simulations and real world experiments. The significant coverage advantage recurrent in our investigation justifies our own and other parallel ongoing work in the implementation and refinement of self-actuated systems.

This work presents an approach for dynamic software reconfiguration in sensor networks. Our approach utilizes explicit models of the design space of the embedded application. The design space is captured by formally modeling all the software components, their interfaces, and their composition. System requirements are expressed as formal constraints on QoS parameters that are measured at runtime. Reconfiguration is performed by transitioning from one point of the operation space to another based on the constraints. We demonstrate our approach using simulation results for a simple sensor network that performs one-dimensional tracking.

Scattered data selection for dense sensor networks

An evaluation methodology is presented for the performance of reporting node self-selection in wireless sensor networks. Five cost metrics are proposed along with several methods for self-selection that involve little or no collaboration with other nodes. These costs are used to evaluate how efficiently the various algorithms allow for node self-selection as simulated on different field complexities. Analysis of different methods over 100 test fields sampled by 2000 nodes indicates that there is no single method that is superior in all respects. Trade-offs in latency and overall energy consumption are revealed to be highly dependent on the selection method and the field complexity.

This paper describes a modeling and simulation framework called VisualSense for wireless sensor networks that builds on and leverages Ptolemy II. This framework supports actor-oriented definition of sensor nodes, wireless communication channels, physical media such as acoustic channels, and wired subsystems. The software architecture consists of a set of base classes for defining channels and sensor nodes, a library of subclasses that provide certain specific channel models and node models, and an extensible visualization framework. Custom nodes can be defined by subclassing the base classes and defining the behavior in Java or by creating composite models using any of several Ptolemy II modeling environments. Custom channels can be defined by subclassing the WirelessChannel base class and by attaching functionality defined in Ptolemy II models.

Flexible power scheduling for sensor networks

2004
We propose a distributed on-demand power-management protocol for collecting data in sensor networks. The protocol aims to reduce power consumption while supporting fluctuating demand in the network and provide local routing information and synchronicity without global control. Energy savings are achieved by powering down nodes during idle times identified through dynamic scheduling. We present a real implementation on wireless sensor nodes based on a novel, two-level architecture. We evaluate our approach through measurements and simulation, and show how the protocol allows adaptive scheduling and enables a smooth trade-off between energy savings and latency. An example current measurement shows an energy savings of 83% on an intermediate node.

Effect of overhearing transmissions on energy efficiency in dense sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Energy efficiency is an important design criterion for the development of sensor networking protocols involving data dissemination and gathering. In-network processing of sensor data, aggregation, transmission power control in radios, and periodic cycling of node wake-up schedules are some techniques that have been proposed in the sensor networking literature for achieving energy efficiency. Owing to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel many nodes in the vicinity of a sender node may overhear its packet transmissions even if they are not the intended recipients of these transmissions. Reception of these transmissions can result in unnecessary expenditure of battery energy of the recipients. We investigate the impact of overhearing transmissions on total energy costs during data gathering and dissemination and attempt to minimize them systematically. We model the minimum energy data gathering problem as a directed minimum energy spanning tree problem where the energy cost of each edge in the wireless connectivity graph is augmented by the overhearing cost of the corresponding transmission. We observe that in dense sensor networks, overhearing costs constitute a significant fraction of the total energy cost and that computing the minimum spanning tree on the augmented cost metric results in energy savings, especially in networks with non-uniform spatial node distribution. We also study the impact of this new metric on the well known energy-efficient dissemination (also called broadcasting) algorithms for multihop wireless networks. We show via simulation that through this augmented cost metric, gains in energy efficiency of 10% or more are possible without additional hardware and minimal additional complexity.

Adaptive clock synchronization in sensor networks

2004
Recent advances in technology have made low cost, low power wireless sensors a reality. Clock synchronization is an important service in any distributed system, including sensor network systems. Applications of clock synchronization in sensor networks include data integration in sensors, sensor reading fusion, TDMA medium access scheduling, and power mode energy saving. However, for a number of reasons, standard clock synchronization protocols are unsuitable for direct application in sensor networks. We introduce the concept of adaptive clock synchronization based on the need of the application and the resource constraint in the sensor networks. We describe a probabilistic method for clock synchronization that uses the higher precision of receiver-to-receiver synchronization, as described in reference broadcast synchronization (RBS) protocol. This deterministic protocol is extended to provide a probabilistic bound on the accuracy of the clock synchronization, allowing for a tradeoff between accuracy and resource requirement. Expressions to convert service specifications (maximum clock synchronization error and confidence probability) to actual protocol parameters (minimum number of messages and synchronization overhead) are derived. Further, we extend this protocol for maintaining clock synchronization in a multihop network.

Lattice sensor networks: capacity limits, optimal routing and robustness to failures
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
We study network capacity limits and optimal routing algorithms for regular sensor networks, namely, square and torus grid sensor networks, in both, the static case (no node failures) and the dynamic case (node failures). For static networks, we derive upper bounds on the network capacity and then we characterize and provide optimal routing algorithms whose rate per node is equal to this upper bound, thus, obtaining the exact analytical expression for the network capacity. For dynamic networks, the unreliability of the network is modeled in two ways: a Markovian node failure and an energy based node failure. Depending on the probability of node failure that is present in the network, we propose to use a particular combination of two routing algorithms, the first one being optimal when there are no node failures at all and the second one being appropriate when the probability of node failure is high. The combination of these two routing algorithms defines a family of randomized routing algorithms, each of them being suitable for a given probability of node failure.

Rate-distortion problem for physics based distributed sensing
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
We consider the rate-distortion problem for sensing the continuous space-time physical temperature in a circular ring on which a heat source is applied over space and time, and which is also allowed to cool by radiation or convection to its surrounding medium. The heat source is modelled as a continuous space-time stochastic process which is bandlimited over space and time. The temperature field is the result of a circular convolution over space and a continuous-time causal filtering over time of the heat source with the Green's function corresponding to the heat equation, which is space and time invariant. The temperature field is sampled at uniform spatial locations by a set of sensors and it has to be reconstructed at a base station. The goal is to minimize the mean-square-error per second, for a given number of nats per second, assuming ideal communication channels between sensors and base station. We find a) the centralized R/sup c/ (D) function of the temperature field, where all the space-time samples can be observed and encoded jointly. Then, we obtain b) the R/sup s-i/ (D) function, where each sensor, independently, encodes its samples optimally over time and c) the R/sup st-i/ (D) function, where each sensor is constrained to encode also independently over time. We also study two distributed prediction-based approaches: a) with perfect feedback from the base station, where temporal prediction is performed at the base station and each sensor performs differential encoding, and b) without feedback, where each sensor locally performs temporal prediction.

The impact of spatial correlation on routing with compression in wireless sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
The efficacy of data aggregation in sensor networks is a function of the degree of spatial correlation in the sensed phenomenon. While several data aggregation (i.e., routing with data compression) techniques have been proposed in the literature, an understanding of the performance of various data aggregation schemes across the range of spatial correlations is lacking. We analyze the performance of routing with compression in wireless sensor networks using an application-independent measure of data compression (an empirically obtained approximation for the joint entropy of sources as a function of the distance between them) to quantify the size of compressed information, and a bit-hop metric to quantify the total cost of joint routing with compression. Analytical modelling and simulations reveal that while the nature of optimal routing with compression does depend on the correlation level, surprisingly, there exists a practical static clustering scheme which can provide near-optimal performance for a wide range of spatial correlations. This result is of great practical significance as it shows that a simple cluster-based system design can perform as well as sophisticated adaptive schemes for joint routing and compression.

Multi-hop communication is order-optimal for homogeneous sensor networks

2004
The main goal of this paper is to show that multi-hop single-user communication achieves the per node transport capacity of /spl Theta/((ln N)/N) in homogeneous sensor networks, making it order-optimal. Our contributions in this paper are three-fold. First, we construct a route-discovery and scheduling scheme based on spatial TDMA for sensor networks. Second, we show that our schedule achieves a per node transport capacity of /spl Theta/ ((ln N)/N), the same as that achievable by beamforming. Third, we compare multi-hop communication and beamforming based methods in terms of the network power consumption required to attain a fixed throughput. Based on our power calculations, we conclude that if the channel attenuation is above a certain threshold (which we calculate), then multi-hop communication performs better, whereas below the threshold, beamforming is preferable.

Sensors acquire noisy measurements and have to communicate them over a power- and possibly bandwidth-constrained interference channel to a set of base stations. The goal of this paper is to analyze, as a function of the number of sensors, the trade-offs between the degrees of freedom of the underlying physical reality, the communication resources (power, temporal and spatial bandwidth), and the resulting distortion at which the physical reality can be estimated by the base stations. The distortion can be expressed as the sum of two fundamentally different terms. The first term reflects the fact that the measurements are noisy. It depends on the number of sensors and on their locations, but it cannot be influenced by the communication resources. The second contribution to the distortion can be controlled by the communication resources, and the key question becomes: What resources are necessary to make it decay at least as fast as the first distortion term, as a function of the number of sensors? This question is answered threefold: First, a lower bound to the power-bandwidth trade-off is derived, showing that at least a constant to linearly increasing total power is required for typical cases (as a function of M). But is this also sufficient? In the second answer, communication strategies are considered where each sensor applies the best possible distributed compression algorithm, followed by capacity-achieving channel codes. For such a separation strategy, it is shown for typical cases that the power must increase exponentially as a function of the number of sensors, suggesting that the lower bound derived in this paper is far too optimistic. However, in the third answer, it is shown that this is not the case: For some example scenarios, the power requirements of the lower bound are indeed achievable, but joint source-channel coding is required. Finally, the problem of sensor synchronization is considered, and it is shown that the scaling laws derived in this paper continue to hold under a Rician fading model.

Distributed optimization in sensor networks

Wireless sensor networks are capable of collecting an enormous amount of data over space and time. Often, the ultimate objective is to derive an estimate of a parameter or function from these data. This paper investigates a general class of distributed algorithms for "in-network" data processing, eliminating the need to transmit raw data to a central point. This can provide significant reductions in the amount of communication and energy required to obtain an accurate estimate. The estimation problems we consider are expressed as the optimization of a cost function involving data from all sensor nodes. The distributed algorithms are based on an incremental optimization process. A parameter estimate is circulated through the network, and along the way each node makes a small adjustment to the estimate based on its local data. Applying results from the theory of incremental subgradient optimization, we show that for a broad class of estimation problems the distributed algorithms converge to within an /spl epsi/-ball around the globally optimal value. Furthermore, bounds on the number incremental steps required for a particular level of accuracy provide insight into the trade-off between estimation performance and communication overhead. In many realistic scenarios, the distributed algorithms are much more efficient, in terms of energy and communications, than centralized estimation schemes. The theory is verified through simulated applications in robust estimation, source localization, cluster analysis and density estimation.

On the scalability and capacity of wireless networks with omnidirectional antennas

2004
We consider a wireless network of N nodes equipped with omnidirectional antennas, and we extend the capacity results of some previous works by finding bounds on the maximum achievable per-node end-to-end throughput, /spl lambda//sub e/, while using a general network model and a bounded propagation model. Specifically, we show that when the network domain has a fixed area, /spl lambda//sub e/ is /spl Theta/(1/N) even when the mobility pattern of the nodes, the temporal variation of transmission powers, the source-destination pairs, and the possibly multi-path routes between them are optimally chosen. This result continues to hold even when the nodes are capable of maintaining multiple transmissions and/or receptions simultaneously, or when the communication bandwidth is partitioned into sub-channels of smaller bandwidth. We also address how /spl lambda//sub e/ depends on the other network parameters such as the area of the network domain, the path loss exponent, or the average number of hops between a source and a destination. Finally, we determine some required conditions to achieve a non-vanishing per-node end-to-end throughput as the number of nodes in the network grows large.

Fusion in sensor networks with communication constraints

2004
We address the problem of optimizing the detection performance of sensor networks under communication constraints on the common access channel. Our work helps understanding tradeoffs between sensor network parameters like number of sensors, degree of quantization at each local sensor, and SNR. Traditionally, this problem is tackled using asymptotic assumptions on the number of sensors, an approach that leads to the abstraction of important details such as the structure of the fusion center. We adopt a non-asymptotic approach and optimize both, the sensing and the fusion sides with respect to the probability of detection error. We show that the optimal fusion rule has an interesting structure similar to the majority-voting rule. In addition, we study the convergence with respect to the number of sensors of the performance of the fusion rule. We show that convergence is SNR dependent and that, in low-SNR environments, asymptotics may require a large number of sensors.

Fractionally cascaded information in a sensor network

2004
We address the problem of distributed information aggregation and storage in a sensor network, where queries can be injected anywhere in the network. The principle we propose is that a sensor should know a "fraction" of the information from distant parts of the network, in an exponentially decaying fashion by distance. We show how a sampled scalar field can be stored in this distributed fashion, with only a modest amount of additional storage and network traffic. Our storage scheme makes neighboring sensors have highly correlated world views; this allows smooth information gradients and enables local search algorithms to work well. We study in particular how this principle of fractionally cascaded information can be exploited to answer range queries about the sampled field efficiently. Using local decisions only we are able to route the query to exactly the portions of the field where the sought information is stored. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis showing that our scheme is close to optimal.

In this paper we develop algorithms for distributed computation of a broad range of estimation and detection tasks over networks with arbitrary but fixed connectivity. The distributed algorithms we develop are linear dynamical systems that generate sequences of approximations to the desired computation. The algorithms are locally constructed at each node by exploiting only locally available and macroscopic information about the network topology. We present methods for designing these distributed algorithms so as to optimize the convergence rates to the desired computation and demonstrate their performance characteristics in the context of a problem of signal estimation from multi-node signal observations in Gaussian noise.

A probabilistic approach to inference with limited information in sensor networks

2004
We present a methodology for a sensor network to answer queries with limited and stochastic information using probabilistic techniques. This capability is useful in that it allows sensor networks to answer queries effectively even when present information is partially corrupt and when more information is unavailable or too costly to obtain. We use a Bayesian network to model the sensor network and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to perform approximate inference. We demonstrate our technique on the specific problem of determining whether a friendly agent is surrounded by enemy agents and present simulation results for it.

Reliability vs. efficiency in distributed source coding for field-gathering sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
The tradeoff between reliability and efficiency in distributed source coding for field-gathering sensor networks is examined. In the considered networks, sensors measure some underlying random field, quantize their measurements, encode the quantized values into bits and transmit these directly, or via relays, to a collector that reconstructs the field. The bits from one sensor's encoder are regarded as a packet. The minimum achievable coding rate can be attained if the sensors are ordered and each applies Slepian-Wolf distributed coding to its data assuming the decoder knows the data from all prior sensors. However, with such a coding scheme, losing even one sensor's packet would cause decoding failure for all subsequent sensors' values. Therefore, one might consider other ways of applying Slepian-Wolf coding, where in trade for increased coding rate, fewer sensor values are lost when a packet is lost. In this paper, the tradeoff between efficiency, i.e. coding rate, and reliability, characterized by a loss factor, is considered for several different Slepian-Wolf based coding schemes as a function of the packet error probability and the size of the network.

Robust distributed estimation in sensor networks using the embedded polygons algorithm
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
We propose a new iterative distributed algorithm for linear minimum mean-squared-error (LMMSE) estimation in sensor networks whose measurements follow a Gaussian hidden Markov graphical model with cycles. The embedded polygons algorithm decomposes a loopy graphical model into a number of linked embedded polygons and then applies a parallel block Gauss-Seidel iteration comprising local LMMSE estimation on each polygon (involving inversion of a small matrix) followed by an information exchange between neighboring nodes and polygons. The algorithm is robust to temporary communication faults such as link failures and sleeping nodes and enjoys guaranteed convergence under mild conditions. A simulation study indicates that energy consumption for iterative estimation increases substantially as more links fail or nodes sleep. Thus, somewhat surprisingly, energy conservation strategies such as low-powered transmission and aggressive sleep schedules could actually be counterproductive.

Nonparametric belief propagation for self-calibration in sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Automatic self-calibration of ad-hoc sensor networks is a critical need for their use in military or civilian applications. In general, self-calibration involves the combination of absolute location information (e.g. GPS) with relative calibration information (e.g. time delay or received signal strength between sensors) over regions of the network. Furthermore, it is generally desirable to distribute the computational burden across the network and minimize the amount of inter-sensor communication. We demonstrate that the information used for sensor calibration is fundamentally local with regard to the network topology and use this observation to reformulate the problem within a graphical model framework. We then demonstrate the utility of nonparametric belief propagation (NBP), a recent generalization of particle filtering, for both estimating sensor locations and representing location uncertainties. NBP has the advantage that it is easily implemented in a distributed fashion, admits a wide variety of statistical models, and can represent multi-modal uncertainty. We illustrate the performance of NBP on several example networks while comparing to a previously published nonlinear least squares method.

We describe an SDP relaxation based method for the position estimation problem in wireless sensor networks. The optimization problem is set up so as to minimize the error in sensor positions to fit distance measures. Observable gauges are developed to check the quality of the point estimation of sensors or to detect erroneous sensors. The performance of this technique is highly satisfactory compared to other techniques. Very few anchor nodes are required to accurately estimate the position of all the unknown nodes in a network. Also the estimation errors are minimal even when the anchor nodes are not suitably placed within the network or the distance measurements are noisy.

On the scalability of hierarchical cooperation for dense sensor networks

2004
In this paper we study the problem of information dissemination in dense multihop sensor networks characterized by highly correlated sample measurements. In particular, we investigate the benefits, and trade-offs, of exploiting correlations via cooperatively compressing the data as it hops around the network. First, we study two extreme cooperation strategies, namely no cooperation and network-wide cooperation. We show that network-wide cooperation achieves logarithmic growth rate for the transport traffic with the network size whereas the schedule length growth rate remains linear. Next, we analyze a two-phase cooperation strategy which localizes cooperation within regions of the network in an attempt to assess the performance of strategies bounded by the two aforementioned extremes. Finally, we extend two-phase cooperation to a multiphase hierarchical cooperation strategy where the number of phases depends on the number of nodes and the size of the cooperation set. The rationale behind this strategy is to achieve logarithmic scaling laws at the expense of more complexity in coordinating nodes' cooperation. In addition, hierarchical cooperation opens room for optimizing the transport traffic and schedule length for a given network size.

We study the optimal way of distributing sensors in a random field to minimize the estimation distortion. We show that this problem is equivalent to certain problems in optimal sampling design and multiterminal source coding. In our model, we partition the field into cells within which the observations are assumed to be the same. A number of identical sensors that can report the observed data to the fusion center at communication rate /spl Delta/R are to be allocated to cells so that the distortion achieved at the fusion center is minimized. We find optimal solutions for the Gaussian, binary and simplified Gaussian vector cases.

Complexity constrained sensor networks: achievable rates for two relay networks and generalizations
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Motivated by limited computational resources in sensor nodes, the impact of complexity constraints on the communication efficiency of sensor networks is studied. A single-parameter characterization of processing limitation of nodes in sensor networks is invoked. Specifically, the relaying nodes are assumed to "donate" only a small part of their total processor time to relay other nodes information. The amount of donated processor time is modelled by the node's ability to decode a channel code reliably at given rate R. Focusing on a four node network, with two relays, prior work for a complexity constrained single relay network is built upon. In the proposed coding scheme, the transmitter sends a broadcast code such that the relays decode only the "coarse" information, and assist the receiver in removing ambiguity only in that information. Via numerical examples, the impact of different power constraints in the system, ranging from per node power bound to network wide power constraint is explored. As the complexity bound R increases, the proposed scheme becomes identical to the recently proposed achievable rate by Gupta & Kumar (2003). Both discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels are considered.

Distributed regression: an efficient framework for modeling sensor network data
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
We present distributed regression, an efficient and general framework for in-network modeling of sensor data. In this framework, the nodes of the sensor network collaborate to optimally fit a global function to each of their local measurements. The algorithm is based upon kernel linear regression, where the model takes the form of a weighted sum of local basis functions; this provides an expressive yet tractable class of models for sensor network data. Rather than transmitting data to one another or outside the network, nodes communicate constraints on the model parameters, drastically reducing the communication required. After the algorithm is run, each node can answer queries for its local region, or the nodes can efficiently transmit the parameters of the model to a user outside the network. We present an evaluation of the algorithm based upon data from a 48-node sensor network deployment at the Intel Research - Berkeley Lab, demonstrating that our distributed algorithm converges to the optimal solution at a fast rate and is very robust to packet losses.

Security is important for many sensor network applications. A particularly harmful attack against sensor and ad hoc networks is known as the Sybil attack based on J.R. Douceur (2002), where a node illegitimately claims multiple identities. This paper systematically analyzes the threat posed by the Sybil attack to wireless sensor networks. We demonstrate that the attack can be exceedingly detrimental to many important functions of the sensor network such as routing, resource allocation, misbehavior detection, etc. We establish a classification of different types of the Sybil attack, which enables us to better understand the threats posed by each type, and better design countermeasures against each type. We then propose several novel techniques to defend against the Sybil attack, and analyze their effectiveness quantitatively.

This work presents a new group communication scheme, roamingcast, for collaborative information processing in wireless sensor networks. Roamingcast enables efficient communication among a subset of mobile terminals in a collaboration group. Unicast and multicast communication can be considered as special cases of roamingcast in which the subset contains one and all group members, respectively. We propose a Roaming Hub Based Architecture (RoamHBA, pronounced as 'rumba') as one solution to support roamingcast. We present the distributed construction and dynamic update of a multicast tree, referred as the roaming hub. This roaming hub has the property that an average pair of terminals communicate using the hub with only constant degradation in path length compared to the best possible path. We have developed network layer protocols implementing this mechanism and evaluated their performance in comparison with roaming restricted flooding. We simulated our design using NS-2.

We describe a low-power VLSI wake-up detector for use in an acoustic surveillance sensor network. The detection criterion is based on the degree of low-frequency periodicity in the acoustic signal. To this end, we have developed a periodicity estimation algorithm that maps particularly well to a low-power VLSI implementation. The time-domain algorithm is based on the "bumpiness" of the autocorrelation of one-bit version of the signal. We discuss the relationship of this algorithm to the maximum-likelihood estimator for periodicity. We then describe a full-custom CMOS ASIC that implements this algorithm. This ASIC is fully functional and its core consumes 835 nanoWatts. The ASIC was integrated into an acoustic enclosure and tested outdoors on synthesized sounds. This unit was also deployed in a three-node sensor network and tested on ground-based vehicles.

On distributed sampling of smooth non-bandlimited fields
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Distributed sampling and reconstruction of a physical field using an array of sensors is a problem of considerable interest in environmental monitoring applications of sensor networks. Our recent work has focused on the sampling of bandlimited sensor fields. However, sensor fields are not perfectly bandlimited but typically have rapidly decaying spectra. In a classical sampling set-up it is possible to precede the A/D sampling operation with an appropriate analog anti-aliasing filter. However, in the case of sensor networks, this is infeasible since sampling must precede filtering. We show that even though the effects of aliasing on the reconstruction cannot be prevented due to the "filter-less" sampling constraint, they can be suitably controlled by oversampling and carefully reconstructing the field from the samples. We show using a dither-based scheme that it is possible to estimate non-bandlimited fields with a precision that depends on how fast the spectral content of the field decays. We develop a framework for analyzing non-bandlimited fields that lead to upper bounds on the maximum pointwise error for a spatial bit rate of R bits/meter. We present results for fields with exponentially decaying spectra as an illustration. In particular, we show that for fields f(t) with exponential tails; i.e., F(/spl omega/) < /spl pi//spl alpha//sup -/spl alpha/|/spl omega/|/, the maximum pointwise error decays as c2e/sup -a//sub 1//spl radic/R+ c3 1//spl radic/R (e/sup -2a//sub 1//spl radic/R) with spatial bit rate R bits/meter. Finally, we show that for fields with spectra that have a finite second moment, the distortion decreases as O((1/N)/sup 2/3/) as the density of sensors, N, scales up to infinity . We show that if D is the targeted non-zero distortion, then the required (finite) rate R scales as O (1 //spl radic/D log 1/D).

Loss inference in wireless sensor networks based on data aggregation

2004
We consider the problem of inferring per node loss rates from passive end-to-end measurements in wireless sensor networks. Specifically, we consider the case of inferring loss rates during the aggregation of data from a collection of sensor nodes to a sink node. Previous work has studied the general problem of network inference, which considers the cases of inferring link-based metrics in wireline networks. We show how to adapt previous work on network inference so that loss rates in wireless sensor networks may be inferred as well. This includes (1) considering the per-node, instead of per-link, loss rates; and (2) taking into account the unique characteristics of wireless sensor networks. We formulate the problem as a maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and show how it can be efficiently solved using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The results of the inference procedure may then be utilized in various ways to effectively streamline the data collection process. Finally, we validate our analysis through simulations.

Distinct from wireless ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks are data-centric, application-oriented, collaborative, and energy-constrained in nature. In this paper, formulate the problem of data transport in sensor networks as an optimization problem whose objective function is to maximize the amount of information (utility) collected at sinks (subscribers), subject to the flow, energy and channel bandwidth constraints. Also, based on a Markov model extended from G. Bianchi (2000), we derive the link delay and the node capacity in both the single and multi-hop environments, and figure them in the problem formulation. We study three special cases under the problem formulation. In particular, we consider the energy-aware flow control problem, derive an energy aware flow control solution, and investigate via ns-2 simulation its performance. The simulation results show that the proposed energy-aware flow control solution can achieve high utility and low delay without congesting the network.

Entropy-based sensor selection heuristic for target localization

None
2004
We propose an entropy-based sensor selection heuristic for localization. Given 1) a prior probability distribution of the target location, and 2) the locations and the sensing models of a set of candidate sensors for selection, the heuristic selects an informative sensor such that the fusion of the selected sensor observation with the prior target location distribution would yield on average the greatest or nearly the greatest reduction in the entropy of the target location distribution. The heuristic greedily selects one sensor in each step without retrieving any actual sensor observations. The heuristic is also computationally much simpler than the mutual-information-based approaches. The effectiveness of the heuristic is evaluated using localization simulations in which Gaussian sensing models are assumed for simplicity. The heuristic is more effective when the optimal candidate sensor is more informative.

Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
In this work, we present a method for the selection of a subset of nodes in a wireless sensor network whose application is to reconstruct the image of a (spatially) bandlimited physical value (e.g., temperature). The selection method creates a sampling pattern based on blue noise masking and guarantees a near minimal number of activated sensors for a given signal-to-noise ratio. The selection method is further enhanced to guarantee that the sensor nodes with the least residual energy are the primary candidates for deselection, while enabling a tradeoff between sensor selection optimality and balanced load distribution. Simulation results show the effectiveness of these selection methods in improving signal-to-noise ratio and reducing the necessary number of active sensors compared with simpler selection approaches.

Efficient and robust query processing in dynamic environments using random walk techniques
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Many existing systems for sensor networks rely on state information stored in the nodes for proper operation (e.g., pointers to parent in a spanning tree, routing information, etc). In dynamic environments, such systems must adopt failure recovery mechanisms, which significantly increase the complexity and impact the overall performance. We investigate alternative schemes for query processing based on random walk techniques. The robustness of this approach under dynamics follows from the simplicity of the process, which only requires the connectivity of the neighborhood to keep moving. In addition we show that visiting a constant fraction of sensor network, say 80%, using a random walk is efficient in number of messages and sufficient for answering many interesting queries with high quality. Finally, the natural behavior of a random walk, also provide the important properties of load-balancing and scalability.

Co-Grid: an efficient coverage maintenance protocol for distributed sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Wireless sensor networks often face the critical challenge of sustaining long-term operation on limited battery energy. Coverage maintenance protocols can effectively prolong network lifetime by maintaining sufficient sensing coverage over a region using a small number of active nodes while scheduling the others to sleep. We present a novel distributed coverage maintenance protocol called the coordinating grid (Co-Grid). In contrast to existing coverage maintenance protocols which are based on simpler detection models, Co-Grid adopts a distributed detection model based on data fusion that is more consistent with many distributed sensing applications. Co-Grid organizes the network into coordinating fusion groups located on overlapping virtual grids. Through coordination among neighboring fusion groups, Co-Grid can achieve comparable number of active nodes as a centralized algorithm, while reducing the network (re-)configuration time by orders of magnitude. Co-Grid is especially suitable for large and energy-constrained sensor networks that require quick (re-)configuration in response to node failures and environmental changes. We validate our claims by both theoretical analysis and simulations.

Distributed state representation for tracking problems in sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
This paper investigates the problem of designing decentralized representations to support monitoring and inferences in sensor networks. State-space models of physical phenomena such as those arising from tracking multiple interacting targets, while commonly used in signal processing and control, suffer from the curse of dimensionality as the number of phenomena of interest increases. Furthermore, mapping an inference algorithm onto a distributed sensor network must appropriately allocate scarce sensing and communication resources. We address the state-space explosion problem by developing a distributed state-space model that switches between factored and joint state spaces as appropriate. We develop a collaborative group abstraction as a mechanism to effectively support the information flow within and across subspaces of the state-space model, which can be efficiently supported in a communication-constrained network. The approach has been implemented and demonstrated in a simulation of tracking multiple interacting targets.

A bit-map-assisted energy-efficient MAC scheme for wireless sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Low-energy characteristics of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) pose a great design challenge for MAC control design. Recent studies have proposed different intra-cluster communication bit-map-assisted (BMA) MAC protocol for large-scale cluster-based WSNs. BMA is intended for event-driven applications, where sensor nodes transmit data to the cluster head only if significant events are observed. In addition, we provide the energy and packet latency analytical models for BMA, conventional TDMA, and energy efficient TDMA (E-TDMA) when used as intra-cluster MAC schemes. Our results show that BMA is superior for the cases of low and medium traffic loads, relatively few sensor nodes per cluster, and relatively large data packet sizes. In addition, BMA performs better than the TDMA-based MAC schemes in terms of average packet latency.

Virtual radar imaging for sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Most approaches to sensor data collection in the literature are based on a multihop wireless relay between sensor nodes forming an ad hoc network to reach a remote data-processing destination. We propose an alternative virtual radar paradigm, which, in its most rudimentary form, is implementable with sensor nodes without networking capabilities. We introduce this concept for a simple setting in which each sensor only has one bit of information to send (e.g., indicating whether the level of a certain chemical has crossed a threshold). "Active" sensors (those which have one to send) respond to a beacon sent by the collector node, precisely timed with a trigger sequence in the beacon. The collector node uses a modified version of synthetic aperture radar processing to obtain an "image" of the activity in the sensor network.

Estimation from lossy sensor data: jump linear modeling and Kalman filtering
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Due to constraints in cost, power, and communication, losses often arise in large sensor networks. The sensor can be modeled as an output of a linear stochastic system with random losses of the sensor output samples. This paper considers the general problem of state estimation for jump linear systems where the discrete transitions are modeled as a Markov chain. Among other applications, this rich model can be used to analyze sensor networks. The sensor loss events are then modeled as Markov processes. Under the jump linear system model, many types of underlying losses can be easily considered, and the optimal estimator to be performed at the receiver in the presence of missing sensor data samples is given by a standard time-varying Kalman filter. We show that the asymptotic average estimation error variance converges and is given by a linear matrix inequality, which can be easily solved. Under this framework, any arbitrary Markov loss process can be modeled, and its average asymptotic error variance can be directly computed. We include a few illustrative examples including fixed-length burst errors, a two-state model, and partial losses due to multiple SNR states. Our analysis encompasses modeling discrete changes not only in the received data as stated above, but also in the underlying system. In the context of the lossy sensor model, the former allows for variation in sensor positioning, power control, and loss of data communications; the latter could allow for discrete changes in the dynamics of the variable monitored by the sensor. This freedom in modeling yields a tool that is potentially valuable in various scenarios in which entities that share information are subjected to challenging and time-varying network conditions.

Power-efficient sensor placement and transmission structure for data gathering under distortion constraints
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
We consider the joint optimization of sensor placement and transmission structure for data gathering, where a given number of nodes need to be placed in a field such that the sensed data can be reconstructed at a sink within specified distortion bounds while minimizing the energy consumed for communication. We assume that the nodes use joint entropy coding based on explicit communication between sensor nodes, and consider both maximum and average distortion bounds. The optimization is complex since it involves an interplay between the spaces of possible transmission structures given radio reachability limitations, and feasible placements satisfying distortion bounds. We address this problem by first looking at the simplified problem of optimal placement in the one-dimensional case. An analytical solution is derived for the case when there is a simple aggregation scheme, and numerical results are provided for the cases when joint entropy encoding is used. We use the insight from our 1-D analysis to extend our results to the 2-D case, and show that our algorithm for two-dimensional placement and transmission structure provides significant power benefit over a commonly used combination of uniformly random placement and shortest path trees.

Backcasting: adaptive sampling for sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Wireless sensor networks provide an attractive approach to spatially monitoring environments. Wireless technology makes these systems relatively flexible, but also places heavy demands on energy consumption for communications. This raises a fundamental trade-off: using higher densities of sensors provides more measurements, higher resolution and better accuracy, but requires more communications and processing. This paper proposes a new approach, called "back-casting," which can significantly reduce communications and energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy. Back-casting operates by first having a small subset of the wireless sensors communicate their information to a fusion center. This provides an initial estimate of the environment being sensed, and guides the allocation of additional network resources. Specifically, the fusion center backcasts information based on the initial estimate to the network at large, selectively activating additional sensor nodes in order to achieve a target error level. The key idea is that the initial estimate can detect correlations in the environment, indicating that many sensors may not need to be activated by the fusion center. Thus, adaptive sampling can save energy compared to dense, non-adaptive sampling. This method is theoretically analyzed in the context of field estimation and it is shown that the energy savings can be quite significant compared to conventional approaches. For example, when sensing a piecewise smooth field with an array of 100 /spl times/ 100 sensors, adaptive sampling can reduce the energy consumption by roughly a factor of 10 while providing the same accuracy achievable if all sensors were activated.

Set k-cover algorithms for energy efficient monitoring in wireless sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are emerging as an effective means for environment monitoring. This paper investigates a strategy for energy efficient monitoring in WSNs that partitions the sensors into covers, and then activates the covers iteratively in a round-robin fashion. This approach takes advantage of the overlap created when many sensors monitor a single area. Our work builds upon previous work by Slijepcevic and Potkonjak (2001), where the model is first formulated. We have designed three approximation algorithms for a variation of the set k-cover problem, where the objective is to partition the sensors into covers such that the number of covers that include an area, summed over all areas, is maximized. The first algorithm is randomized and partitions the sensors, in expectation, within a fraction 1 - (1/e) (/spl sim/ .63) of the optimum. We present two other deterministic approximation algorithms. One is a distributed greedy algorithm with a 1/2 approximation ratio and the other is a centralized greedy algorithm with a 1 - (1/e) approximation ratio. We show that it is NP-complete to guarantee better than 15/16 of the optimal coverage, indicating that all three algorithms perform well with respect to the best approximation algorithm possible in polynomial time, assuming P /spl ne/ NP. Simulations indicate that in practice, the deterministic algorithms perform far above their worst case bounds, consistently covering more than 72% of what is covered by an optimum solution. Simulations also indicate that the increase in longevity is proportional to the amount of overlap amongst the sensors. The algorithms are fast, easy to use, and according to simulations, significantly increase the longevity of sensor networks. The randomized algorithm in particular seems quite practical.

Distributed online localization in sensor networks using a moving target
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
We describe a novel method for node localization in a sensor network where there are a fraction of reference nodes with known locations. For application-specific sensor networks, we argue that it makes sense to treat localization through online distributed learning and integrate it with an application task such as target tracking. We propose distributed online algorithm in which sensor nodes use geometric constraints induced by both radio connectivity and sensing to decrease the uncertainty of their position. The sensing constraints, which are caused by a commonly sensed moving target, are usually tighter than connectivity based constraints and lead to a decrease in average localization error over time. Different sensing models, such as radial binary detection and distance-bound estimation, are considered. First, we demonstrate our approach by studying a simple scenario in which a moving beacon broadcasts its own coordinates to the nodes in its vicinity. We then generalize this to the case when instead of a beacon, there is a moving target with a-priori unknown coordinates. The algorithms presented are fully distributed and assume only local information exchange between neighboring nodes. Our results indicate that the proposed method can be used to significantly enhance the accuracy in position estimation, even when the fraction of reference nodes is small. We compare the efficiency of the distributed algorithms to the case when node positions are estimated using centralized (convex) programming. Finally, simulations using the TinyOS-Nido platform are used to study the performance in more realistic scenarios.

Network coverage using low duty-cycled sensors: random &amp; coordinated sleep algorithms
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
This paper investigates the problem of providing network coverage using wireless sensors that operate on low duty cycles (measured by the percentage time a sensor is on or active), i.e., each sensor alternates between active and sleep states to conserve energy with an average sleep period (much) longer than the active period. The dynamic change in topology as a result of such duty-cycling has potentially disruptive effect on the operation and performance of the network. This is compensated by adding redundancy in the sensor deployment. In this paper we examine the fundamental relationship between the reduction in sensor duty cycle and the required level of redundancy for a fixed performance measure, and explore the design of good sensor sleep schedules. In particular, we consider two types of mechanisms, the random sleep type where each sensor keeps an active-sleep schedule independent of another, and the coordinated sleep type where sensors coordinate with each other in reaching an active-sleep schedule. Both types are studied within the context of providing network coverage. We present specific scheduling algorithms within each type, and illustrate their coverage and duty cycle properties via both analysis and simulation. We show with either type of sleep schedule the benefit of added redundancy saturates at some point in that the reduction in duty cycles starts to diminish beyond a certain threshold in deployment redundancy. We also show that at the expense of extra control overhead, a coordinated sleep schedule is more robust and can achieve higher duty cycle reduction with the same amount of redundancy compared to a random sleep schedule.

On the effect of localization errors on geographic face routing in sensor networks

None
2004
In the absence of localization errors, geographic routing - using a combination of greedy forwarding and face routing - has been shown to work correctly and efficiently. The effects of location errors on geographic routing have not been studied before. In this work we provide a detailed analysis of the effects of location errors on the correctness and performance of geographic routing in static sensor networks. First, we perform a micro-level behavioural analysis to identify the possible protocol error scenarios and their conditions and bounds. Then, we present results from an extensive simulation study of GPRS and GHT to quantify the performance degradation due to location errors (of 10% of the radio range or less) can in fact lead to incorrect (non-recoverable) geographic routing with noticeable performance degradation. We then introduce a simple modification for face routing that eliminates probable errors and leads to near perfect performance.

Topology management schemes conserve energy in wireless ad hoc networks by identifying redundant nodes that may turn off their radios or other components while maintaining connectivity. We present Naps, a randomized topology management scheme that does not rely on geographic location information, provides exibility in the target density of waking nodes, and sends only a periodic heartbeat message between waking neighbors; thus it is implementable even on modest hardware. We formally analyze the connectivity of the waking graphs produced by Naps, showing that these graphs have nearly complete connectivity even at relatively low densities. We examine simulation results for a wide range of initial deployment densities and for heterogeneous and mobile deployments.

Distributed beamforming for information transfer in sensor networks

2004
Energy efficient transfer of data from sensors is a fundamental problem in sensor networks. We propose a distributed beamforming approach to this problem, with a cluster of sensors emulating a centralized antenna array. While it is well-known that beamforming can provide large performance gains, such gains presuppose not only accurate knowledge of the channel, but also time and phase synchronization at the transmitter. We propose explicit methods for achieving such synchronization in a distributed fashion, and analyze the effects of various sources of coordination error on the attained performance. We find that, as long as the error in range measurements or placement of the sensor nodes is within a fraction of a carrier wavelength, the proposed distributed beamforming strategies achieve most of the gains available from a centralized beamformer.

Distributed particle filters for sensor networks
Third International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2004. IPSN 2004
None
2004
This paper describes two methodologies for performing distributed particle filtering in a sensor network. It considers the scenario in which a set of sensor nodes make multiple, noisy measurements of an underlying, time-varying state that describes the monitored system. The goal of the proposed algorithms is to perform on-line, distributed estimation of the current state at multiple sensor nodes, whilst attempting to minimize communication overhead. The first algorithm relies on likelihood factorization and the training of parametric models to approximate the likelihood factors. The second algorithm adds a predictive scalar quantizer training step into the more standard particle filtering framework, allowing adaptive encoding of the measurements. As its primary example, the paper describes the application of the quantization-based algorithm to tracking a maneuvering object. The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the presented technique and an indication of future avenues for enhancement.

Coverage and hole-detection in sensor networks via homology
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
We consider coverage problems in sensor networks of stationary nodes with minimal geometric data. In particular, there are no coordinates and no localization of nodes. We introduce a new technique for detecting holes in coverage by means of homology, an algebraic topological invariant. The impetus for these techniques is a completion of network communication graphs to two types of simplicial complexes: the nerve complex and the Rips complex. The former gives information about coverage intersection of individual sensor nodes, and is very difficult to compute. The latter captures connectivity in terms of inter-node communication: it is easy to compute but does not in itself yield coverage data. We obtain coverage data by using persistence of homology classes for Rips complexes. These homological invariants are computable: we provide simulation results.

Virtual patrol: a new power conservation design for surveillance using sensor networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
Surveillance has been a typical application of wireless sensor networks. To conduct surveillance of a given area in real life, one can use stationary watch towers, or can also use patrolling sentinels. Comparing them to solutions in sensor network surveillance, all current coverage based methods fall into the first category. In this paper, we propose and study patrol-based surveillance operations in sensor networks. Two patrol models are presented: the coverage-oriented patrol and the on-demand patrol. They achieve one of the following goals, respectively, i) to achieve surveillance of the entire field with low power drain but still bounded delay of detection; ii) to use an on-demand manner to achieve user initiated surveillance only to interested places. We propose the "SENSTROL" protocol to fulfill the patrol setup procedure for both models. With the implementation in the GloMoSim simulator, it is shown that patrol on arbitrary path can be set up in a network where each node follows a 98%-time-sleep-2%-time-wake power schedule.

Over the last three years we have built and experimented with the Pushpin computing wireless sensor network platform. The Pushpin platform is a tabletop multihop wireless sensor network testbed comprised of 100 nodes arbitrarily placed within a one-square-meter area. The Pushpin platform's concise form factor and extreme node density allow for fine-grained control of its environment and immediate user interaction, thereby uniquely situating it between simulated and real world sensor networks. This paper details our salient successes and lessons learned along the way. We also discuss how these experiences have shaped our vision of the future of wireless sensor networks and some concrete research directions to follow.

Analysis of a wireless sensor dropping problem in wide-area environmental monitoring
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
In this paper we study the following problem: we are given a certain region R to monitor and a requirement on the degree of coverage (DoC) of R to meet by a network of deployed sensors. The latter will be dropped by a moving vehicle, which can release sensors at arbitrary points within R. The node spatial distribution when sensors are dropped at a certain point is modeled by a probability density function F. The network designer is allowed to choose an arbitrary a set of drop points, and to release an arbitrary number of sensors at each point. Given this setting, we consider the problem of determining the optimal grid deployment strategy, i.e., the drop strategy in which release points are arranged in a grid such that (1) the DoC requirement is fulfilled and (2) the total number of deployed nodes n is minimum. This problem is relevant whenever manual node deployment is impossible or overly expensive, and partially controlled deployment is the only feasible choice. The main contribution of this paper is an accurate study of the interrelationships between environmental conditions, DoC requirement, and cost of the deployment. In particular, we show that, for a given value of /spl sigma/ and DoC requirement, optimal grid deployment strategies can be easily identified.

This allows the XYZ and its peripheral boards to transition into deep sleep for extended time intervals. To support mobility hardware control and computations, XYZ supports a wide dynamic range and power options. In low power configuration the node resembles existing small low power nodes. When needed, the node can scale up its resources to perform more powerful computations. Mobility is enabled with an additional accessory board that allows the node to move along a horizontal string. In this paper we provide an overview of the XYZ architecture and provide an insightful power characterization of the different operational modes to allow the users to optimize their platforms for power.

Ecolocation: a sequence based technique for RF localization in wireless sensor networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
In this paper we present a novel sequence-based RF localization algorithm called Ecolocation. Our algorithm determines the location of unknown nodes by examining the ordered sequence of received signal strength (RSS) measurements taken at multiple reference nodes. We employ a constraint-based approach that provides for robust location decoding even in the presence of random RSS fluctuations due to multi-path fading and shadowing. Through extensive systematic simulations, and a representative set of real mote experiments, we show that over a wide range of settings Ecolocation performs better than other state of the art approaches in terms of localization accuracy and precision.

A compact modular wireless sensor platform
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.

2005
We have designed and constructed a modular platform for use in compact wireless sensing. This platform is based around a series of circuit boards (or panes), each of which instantiates a specific sensing modality - e.g. inertial sensing, tactile sensing or ambient sensing. As opposed to similar architectures, this system treats the sensor panes as discrete design objects that have data collection as their primary purpose. The main goals achieved by this design are ease of prototyping (and revision) and encapsulation of design knowledge. We describe a number of different projects instantiated with this system. Key among them are a wearable gait measurement system which exploited the modularity of the system, a novel musical controller which benefited from the design encapsulation and a study of dynamically low-power sensor nodes based on the structure of the panes (i.e. multiple sensors for a single modality). Several other applications are discussed. Lessons learned in the areas of software design, sensor placement and mechanical stability are commented on.

Quantizer design and distributed encoding algorithm for source localization in sensor networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
In this paper, we propose a quantizer design algorithm that is optimized for source localization in sensor networks. For this application, the goal is to minimize the amount of information that the sensor nodes have to exchange in order to achieve a certain source localization accuracy. We show that this goal can be achieved more efficiently when "application-specific" quantizers are used. Our proposed quantizer design algorithm uses a cost function that takes into account the distance between the actual source position and the position estimated based on quantized data. We also propose a distributed encoding algorithm that is applied after quantization and achieves rate savings by merging quantization bins without any degradation of localization performance. The merging technique in the encoding algorithm exploits the fact that certain combinations of quantization bins at each node cannot occur because the corresponding spatial regions have an empty intersection. We apply these algorithms to a system where an acoustic sensor model is employed for localization. For this case, we introduce the equally distance-divided quantizer (EDQ), designed so that quantizer partitions correspond to a uniform partitioning in terms of distance. Our simulations show the improved performance of our quantizer over traditional quantizer designs. In addition, they show rate savings (32.8%, 5 nodes, 4 bits per node) when our novel bin-merging algorithms are used. Our results also show that an optimized bit allocation leads to significant improvements in localization performance with respect to a bit allocation that uses the same number of bits for each node.

Distributed particle filter with GMM approximation for multiple targets localization and tracking in wireless sensor network
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
Two novel distributed particle filters with Gaussian mixer approximation are proposed to localize and track multiple moving targets in a wireless sensor network. The distributed particle filters run on a set of uncorrelated sensor cliques that are dynamically organized based on moving target trajectories. These two algorithms differ in how the distributive computing is performed. In the first algorithm, partial results are updated at each sensor clique sequentially based on partial results forwarded from a neighboring clique and local observations. In the second algorithm, all individual cliques compute partial estimates based only on local observations in parallel, and forward their estimates to a fusion center to obtain final output. In order to conserve bandwidth and power, the local sufficient statistics (belief) is approximated by a low dimensional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) before propagating among sensor cliques. We further prove that the posterior distribution estimated by distributed particle filter convergence almost surely to the posterior distribution estimated from a centralized Bayesian formula. Moreover, a data-adaptive application layer communication protocol is proposed to facilitate sensor self-organization and collaboration. Simulation results show that the proposed DPF with GMM approximation algorithms provide robust localization and tracking performance at much reduced communication overhead.

This paper presents a sensor-based, networked embedded system, referred to as the particle computer system. It is comprised of tiny wireless sensor nodes, capable of communication with each other, as well as connectivity with backend, PC-based systems, thereby facilitating software development and data analysis in an integrated systems package. The core design principles of the sensor nodes enable operation in very mobile settings and truly ad-hoc, peer-to-peer interoperation without the intervention of a master or explicit middleware layer. The two main system properties highlighted in this paper are: 1) information distribution to all components within the system and 2) the usage of a common communication language in all system components. This language has been proprietarily developed for the particle system and is known as ConCom. As a result of these system properties, we have found the particle system to be very extensible and applicable in many everyday scenarios. The paper presents insights to the implementation of the particle computer system, including software development and data analysis capabilities, and the overall system integration.

Efficient routing with small buffers in dense networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
The analysis and design of routing algorithms for finite buffer networks requires solving the associated queue network problem which is known to be hard. We propose alternative and more accurate approximation models to the usual Jackson's theorem that give more insight into the effect of routing algorithms on the queue size distributions. Using the proposed approximation models, we analyze and design routing algorithms that minimize overflow losses in grid networks with finite buffers and different communication patterns, namely uniform communication and data gathering. We show that the buffer size required to achieve the maximum possible rate decreases as the network size increases. Motivated by the insight gained in grid networks, we apply the same principles to the design of routing algorithms for random networks with finite buffers that minimize overflow losses. We show that this requires adequately combining shortest path tree routing and traveling salesman routing. Our results show that such specially designed routing algorithms increase the transmitted rate for a given loss probability up to almost three times, on average, with respect to the usual shortest path tree routing.

Adaptive statistical sampling methods for decentralized estimation and detection of localized phenomena
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
Sensor networks (SNETs) for monitoring spatial phenomena has emerged as an area of significant practical interest. We focus on the important problem of detection of distributed events, sources, or abnormalities that are localized, i.e., only a small number of sensors in the vicinity of the phenomena are in the field of observation. This problem complements the standard decentralized detection problem, where noisy information about an event is measured by the entire network. For localized phenomena the main difficulty arises from the coupling of: a) noisy sensor observations that lead to local false positives/negatives; and b) limited energy, which constrains communication among sensor nodes. Together these difficulties call for reaching a decentralized statistical ordering based on limited collaboration. We are then led to the following fundamental problem: determine the most probable event locations while minimizing communication cost. Our objective in this paper is to characterize the fundamental trade offs between global performance (false alarms and miss rate) and communication cost. We develop a framework to minimize the communication cost subject to worst-case misclassification constraints by making use of the false discovery rate (FDR) concept along with an optimal local measure transformation at each sensor node. The preliminary results show that the FDR concept applied in a sensor networks context leads to significant reduction in the communication cost of the system. A very interesting implication of this work is that the detection performance of a wireless sensor network is comparable to that of a wired network of sensors.

Statistical model of lossy links in wireless sensor networks

None
2005
Recently, several wireless sensor network studies demonstrated large discrepancies between experimentally observed communication properties and properties produced by widely used simulation models. Our first goal is to provide sound foundations for conclusions drawn from these studies by extracting relationships between location (e.g. distance) and communication properties (e.g. reception rate) using non-parametric statistical techniques. The objective is to provide a probability density function that completely characterizes the relationship. Furthermore, we study individual link properties and their correlation with respect to common transmitters, receivers and geometrical location. The second objective is to develop a series of wireless network models that produce networks of arbitrary sizes with realistic properties. We use an iterative improvement-based optimization procedure to generate network instances that are statistically similar to empirically observed networks. We evaluate the accuracy of our conclusions using our models on a set of standard communication tasks, like connectivity maintenance and routing.

Robomote: enabling mobility in sensor networks

Severe energy limitations, and a paucity of computation pose a set of difficult design challenges for sensor networks. Recent progress in two seemingly disparate research areas namely, distributed robotics and low power embedded systems has led to the creation of mobile (or robotic) sensor networks. Autonomous node mobility brings with it its own challenges, but also alleviates some of the traditional problems associated with static sensor networks. We illustrate this by presenting the design of the robomote, a robot platform that functions as a single mobile node in a mobile sensor network. We briefly describe two case studies where the robomote has been used for table top experiments with a mobile sensor network.

Lazy inference on object identities in wireless sensor networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
Maintaining the identities of moving objects is an important aspect of most multi-object tracking applications. Uncertainty in sensor data, coupled with the intrinsic combinatorial difficulty of the data association problem, suggests probabilistic formulations over the set of possible identities. While an explicit representation of a distribution over all associations may require exponential storage and computation, in practice the information provided by this distribution is accessed only in certain stylized ways, as when asking for the identity of a given track, or the track with a given identity. Exploiting this observation, we proposed a practical solution to this problem based on maintaining marginal probabilities and demonstrated its effectiveness in the context of tracking within a wireless sensor network. That method, unfortunately, requires extensive communication in the network whenever new identity observations are made, in order for normalization operations to keep the marginals consistent. In this paper, we have proposed a very different solution based on accumulated log-likelihoods that can postpone all normalization computations until actual identity queries are made. In this manner the continuous communication and computational expense of repeated normalizations is avoided and that effort is expended only when actual queries are made of the network. We compare the two methods in terms of their computational complexities, inference accuracies, and distributed implementations. Simulation and experimental results from a RFID system are also presented.

We analyze the performance of an approximate distributed Kalman filter proposed in recent work on distributed coordination. This approach to distributed estimation is novel in that it admits a systematic analysis of its performance as various network quantities such as connection density, topology, and bandwidth are varied. Our main contribution is a frequency-domain characterization of the distributed estimator's steady-state performance; this is quantified in terms of a special matrix associated with the connection topology called the graph Laplacian, and also the rate of message exchange between immediate neighbors in the communication network.

The Intel mote is a new sensor node platform motivated by several design goals: increased CPU performance, improved radio bandwidth and reliability, and the usage of commercial off-the-shelf components in order to maintain cost-effectiveness. This new platform is built around an integrated wireless microcontroller consisting of an ARM*7 core, a Bluetooth radio, SRAM and FLASH memory, as well as various I/O options. The Intel Mote software architecture is based on an ARM port of TinyOS. Networking and routing layers have been created on top of the TinyOS base to provide Bluetooth-based multi-hop functionality. The network is self-organizing on startup and has mechanisms to repair failed links and circumvent failed nodes. A reliable high bandwidth streaming transport layer has also been created. The Intel Mote was deployed in an equipment monitoring application using industrial vibration sensors. This application was chosen since it benefits from the increased platform capabilities and network bandwidth of the Intel Mote platform. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the observed network operation, packet transfer rates, and power consumption.

A scheme for robust distributed sensor fusion based on average consensus

None
2005
We consider a network of distributed sensors, where where each sensor takes a linear measurement of some unknown parameters, corrupted by independent Gaussian noises. We propose a simple distributed iterative scheme, based on distributed average consensus in the network, to compute the maximum-likelihood estimate of the parameters. This scheme doesn't involve explicit point-to-point message passing or routing; instead, it diffuses information across the network by updating each node's data with a weighted average of its neighbors' data (they maintain the same data structure). At each step, every node can compute a local weighted least-squares estimate, which converges to the global maximum-likelihood solution. This scheme is robust to unreliable communication links. We show that it works in a network with dynamically changing topology, provided that the infinitely occurring communication graphs are jointly connected.

Ubiquitous computing applications often use a user's context to automatically adjust their behavior to the situation. We have developed three types of wireless sensor nodes that can be worn, carried, or embedded in the environment that can provide interesting contextual information: a rich multi-sensor node to infer human activity that can be worn by a person or be part of a sensing environment, a portable wireless node for reading and writing short-range radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, and a small wrist-watch-sized wireless display device that can serve as an easily accessible and 'glanceable' user interface. We report on our experiences in building these platforms and using them in some initial applications. We conclude with suggestions for future work in creating platforms that help blend sensor networks into ubiquitous computing.

Geographic routing with limited information in sensor networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
Geographic routing with greedy relaying strategies have been widely studied as a routing scheme in sensor networks. These schemes assume that the nodes have perfect information about the location of the destination. We consider three scenarios: (i) where nodes have location errors (imprecise GPS), (ii) where only coarse geographic information about the destination is available, such as the quadrant or half-plane in which the destination is located, and (iii) where only a small fraction of the nodes have routing information. In this paper, we show that even with such imprecise or limited destination-location information, the routing delays are /spl Theta/(1/M(n)). We further show that routing delays of this magnitude can be obtained even if only a small fraction of the nodes have any location information, and other nodes simply forward the packet to a randomly chosen neighbor, and we validate our analysis with simulation. Finally, we consider the throughput-capacity of networks with progressive routing strategies that take packets closer to the destination in every step, but not necessarily along a straight-line. Such a routing strategy could potentially lead to spatial "hot spots" in the network where many data flows intersect at a spatial region (a node or group of nodes), due to "sub-optimal" routes with increased path-lengths. In this paper, we show that the effect of hot spots due to progressive routing does not reduce the network throughput-capacity in an order sense. In other words, the throughput-capacity with progressive routing is order-wise the same as the maximum achievable throughput-capacity.

Estimation in sensor networks: a graph approach

2005
In many sensor networks applications, sensors collect correlated measurements of a physical field, e.g., temperature field in a building or in a data center. However, the locations of the sensors are usually inconsistent with the application requirements. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the field at arbitrary positions of interest, where there are possibly no sensors, from the irregularly placed sensors. We map this sensor network on a graph, and, by introducing the concepts of interconnection matrices, system digraphs, and cut point sets, we can pose sensor network tradeoffs and derive real-time field estimation algorithms. The results of temperature field estimation, obtained from simulations and real world experiments, show that the methodology presented in this paper can successfully predict the field values at arbitrary locations, including others than the ones with sensors.

On target tracking with binary proximity sensors

We consider the use of binary proximity sensors for tracking targets. Such sensors provide only 1-bit information regarding a target's presence or absence in their vicinity, albeit with less than 100% reliability. A novel tracking method employing such binary sensors is proposed and its performance in different deployment scenarios evaluated. For a given target, the method utilizes the sensor outputs to estimate individual positions in the path of the target in the near past and finds the line which best fits the path points. This line is then used to estimate the target's current position. A performance study has been conducted through comprehensive simulation using parameters collected from a prototype deployment consisting of wireless micro-sensors with binary acoustic detectors.

The effects of ranging noise on multihop localization: an empirical study

2005
This paper presents a study of how empirical ranging characteristics affect multihop localization in wireless sensor networks. We use an objective metric to evaluate a well-established parametric model of ranging called Noisy Disk: if the model accurately predicts the results of a real-world deployment, it sufficiently captures ranging characteristics. When the model does not predict accurately, we systematically replace components of the model with empirical ranging characteristics to identify which components contribute to the discrepancy. We reveal that both the connectivity and noise components of Noisy Disk fail to accurately represent real-world ranging characteristics and show that these shortcomings affect localization in different ways under different circumstances.

Beyond event handlers: programming wireless sensors with attributed state machines
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
Event-driven programming is a popular paradigm for programming sensor nodes. It is based on the specification of actions (also known as event handlers) which are triggered by the occurrence of events. While this approach is both simple and efficient, it suffers from two important limitations. Firstly, the association of events to actions is static-there is no explicit support for adopting this association depending on the program state. Secondly, a program is split up into many distinct actions without explicit support for sharing information among these. These limitations often lead to issues with code modularity, complexity, and correctness. To tackle these issues we propose OSM, a programming model and language for sensor nodes based on finite state machines. OSM extends the event paradigm with states and transitions, such that the invocation of actions becomes a function of both the event and the program state. For removing the second limitation, OSM introduces state attributes that allow sharing of information among actions. They can be considered local variables of a state with support for automatic memory management. OSM specifications can be compiled into sequential C code that requires only minimal runtime support, resulting in efficient and compact systems.

Simulation can be an important step in the development of software for wireless sensor networks and has been the subject of intense research in the past decade. While most previous efforts in simulating wireless sensor networks have focused on protocol-level issues utilizing models of the software implementation, a significant challenge remains in precisely measuring time-dependent properties such as radio channel utilization. One promising approach, first demonstrated by ATEMU, is to simulate the behavior of sensor network programs at the machine code level with cycle-accuracy, but poor performance has so far limited its scalability. In this paper we present Avrora, a cycle-accurate instruction-level sensor network simulator which scales to networks of up to 10,000 nodes and performs as much as 20 times faster than previous simulators with equivalent accuracy, handling as many as 25 nodes in real-time. We show how an event queue can enable efficient instruction-level simulation of microcontroller programs and allow the hidden parallelism in finegrained sensor network simulations to be extracted, once two core synchronization problems are identified and solved. Avrora's ability to measure detailed time-critical phenomena can shed new light on design Issues for large-scale sensor networks.

IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
We consider a sensor network measuring correlated data, where the task is to gather all data from the network nodes to a sink. We consider the case where data at nodes is lossy coded with high-resolution, and the information measured by the nodes should be available at the sink within certain total and individual distortion bounds. First, we consider the problem of finding the optimal transmission structure and the rate-distortion allocations at the various spatially located nodes, such as to minimize the total power consumption cost of the network. We prove that the optimal transmission structure is the shortest path tree and that the problems of rate and distortion allocation separate in the high-resolution case, namely, we first find the distortion allocation as a function of the transmission structure, and then the rate allocation is computed. Then, we also study the case when the node positions can be chosen, by finding the optimal node placement when two different targets of interest are considered, namely total power minimization and network lifetime extension.

Attack-resistant location estimation in sensor networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.

2005
Many sensor network applications require sensors' locations to function correctly. Despite the recent advances, location discovery for sensor networks in hostile environments has been mostly overlooked. Most of the existing localization protocols for sensor networks are vulnerable in hostile environments. The security of location discovery can certainly be enhanced by authentication. However, the possible node compromises and the fact that location determination uses certain physical features (e.g., received signal strength) of radio signals make authentication not as effective as in traditional security applications. This paper presents two methods to tolerate malicious attacks against beacon-based location discovery in sensor networks. The first method filters out malicious beacon signals on the basis of the "consistency" among multiple beacon signals, while the second method tolerates malicious beacon signals by adopting an it era lively refined voting scheme. Both methods can survive malicious attacks even if the attacks bypass authentication, provided that the benign beacon signals constitute the majority of the "consistent" beacon signals. This paper also presents the implementation of these techniques on MICA2 motes running TinyOS, and the evaluation through both simulation and field experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods are promising for the current generation of sensor networks.

Snow crashing the diamond age: mobile devices meet sensor networks

2005
Personal mobile computing devices share many of the same properties of nodes in a sensor network. They are both sensor-rich, power-limited, and wirelessly connected. Indeed, a number of researchers have described sensor networks composed of collections of mobile devices. Sensor networks may be naively characterized as instrumentation of a fixed space or structure. Mobile devices are appliances in the service of an individual. Imagining the potential of these technologies in combination is a matter of proposing applications. However, combined applications must abide by the tight energy and bandwidth constraints imposed on sensor networks. A conventional mobile device risks becoming the bull in a china shop if it requires service from surrounding sensor networks. This talk examines both the potential and limitations of combined applications.

2005
We introduce a power-aware microsensor architecture supporting a wide operational power range (from <1 mW to >10 W). The platform consists of a family of modules that follow a common set of design principles. Each module includes a local power microcontroller, power switches, and isolation switches to enable independent power-down control of modules and module subsystems. Processing resources are scaled appropriately on each module for their role in the collective system. Hard real-time functions are migrated to the sensor and radio modules for improved power efficiency. The optional Linux-based processor module supports high duty cycling and advanced sleep modes. Our reference hardware implementation is described in detail in this paper. Seven different modules have been developed. We utilize an acoustic vehicle tracking application to demonstrate how the architecture operates and report on results from field tests on tracked and wheeled vehicles.

The problems of sensor configuration and activation for the detection of correlated random fields using large sensor arrays are considered. Using results that characterize the large-array performance of sensor networks in this application, the detection capabilities of different sensor configurations are analyzed and compared. The dependence of the optimal choice of configuration on parameters such as sensor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), field correlation, etc., is examined, yielding insights into the most effective choices for sensor selection and activation in various operating regimes.

Sensing capacity for discrete sensor network applications

None
2005
We bound the number of sensors required to achieve a desired level of sensing accuracy in a discrete sensor network application (e.g. distributed detection). We model the state of nature being sensed as a discrete vector, and the sensor network as an encoder. Our model assumes that each sensor observes only a subset of the state of nature, that sensor observations are localized and dependent, and that sensor network output across different states of nature is neither identical nor independently distributed. Using a random coding argument we prove a lower bound on the 'sensing capacity' of a sensor network, which characterizes the ability of a sensor network to distinguish among all states of nature. We compute this lower bound for sensors of varying range, noise models, and sensing functions. We compare this lower bound to the empirical performance of a belief propagation based sensor network decoder for a simple seismic sensor network scenario. The key contribution of this paper is to introduce the idea of a sharp cut-off function in the number of required sensors, to the sensor network community.

Design considerations for solar energy harvesting wireless embedded systems

2005
Sustainable operation of battery powered wireless embedded systems (such as sensor nodes) is a key challenge, and considerable research effort has been devoted to energy optimization of such systems. Environmental energy harvesting, in particular solar based, has emerged as a viable technique to supplement battery supplies. However, designing an efficient solar harvesting system to realize the potential benefits of energy harvesting requires an in-depth understanding of several factors. For example, solar energy supply is highly time varying and may not always be sufficient to power the embedded system. Harvesting components, such as solar panels, and energy storage elements, such as batteries or ultracapacitors, have different voltage-current characteristics, which must be matched to each other as well as the energy requirements of the system to maximize harvesting efficiency. Further, battery non-idealities, such as self-discharge and round trip efficiency, directly affect energy usage and storage decisions. The ability of the system to modulate its power consumption by selectively deactivating its sub-components also impacts the overall power management architecture. This paper describes key issues and tradeoffs which arise in the design of solar energy harvesting, wireless embedded systems and presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of Heliomote, our prototype that addresses several of these issues. Experimental results demonstrate that Heliomote, which behaves as a plug-in to the Berkeley/Crossbow motes and autonomously manages energy harvesting and storage, enables near-perpetual, harvesting aware operation of the sensor node.

ROPE: robust position estimation in wireless sensor networks

2005
We address the problem of secure location determination, known as secure localization, and the problem of verifying the location claim of a node, known as location verification, in wireless sensor networks (WSN). We propose a robust positioning system we call ROPE that allows sensors to determine their location without any centralized computation. In addition, ROPE provides a location verification mechanism that verifies the location claims of the sensors before data collection. We show that ROPE bounds the ability of an attacker to spoof sensors' locations, with relatively low density deployment of reference points. We confirm the robustness of ROPE against attacks analytically and via simulations.

A robust architecture for distributed inference in sensor networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
Many inference problems that arise in sensor networks require the computation of a global conclusion that is consistent with local information known to each node. A large class of these problems-including probabilistic inference, regression, and control problems-can be solved by message passing on a data structure called a junction tree. In this paper, we present a distributed architecture for solving these problems that is robust to unreliable communication and node failures. In this architecture, the nodes of the sensor network assemble themselves into a junction tree and exchange messages between neighbors to solve the inference problem efficiently and exactly. A key part of the architecture is an efficient distributed algorithm for optimizing the choice of junction tree to minimize the communication and computation required by inference. We present experimental results from a prototype implementation on a 97-node Mica2 mote network, as well as simulation results for three applications: distributed sensor calibration, optimal control, and sensor field modeling. These experiments demonstrate that our distributed architecture can solve many important inference problems exactly, efficiently, and robustly.

Ubiquitous access to distributed data in large-scale sensor networks through decentralized erasure codes

None
2005
Consider a large-scale wireless sensor network of n nodes, where a fraction k out of n generate data packets of global interest. Assuming that the individual nodes have limited storage and computational capabilities, we address the problem of how to enable ubiquitous access to the distributed data packets. Specifically, we assume that each node can store at most one data packet, and study the problem of diffusing the data so that by querying any k nodes, it is possible to retrieve all the k data packets of interest (with high probability). We introduce a class of erasure codes and show how to solve this problem efficiently in a completely distributed and robust way. Specifically we show that we can efficiently diffuse the data by "pre-routing" only O(ln n) packets per data node to randomly selected storage nodes. By using the proposed scheme, the distributed data becomes available "at the fingertips" of a potential data collector located anywhere in the network.

Mobile agent middleware for sensor networks: an application case study

None
2005
Agilla is a mobile agent middleware that facilitates the rapid deployment of adaptive applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Agilla allows users to create and inject special programs called mobile agents that coordinate through local tuple spaces, and migrate across the WSN performing application-specific tasks. This fluidity of code and state has the potential to transform a WSN into a shared, general-purpose computing platform capable of running several autonomous applications at a time, allowing us to harness its full potential. We have implemented and evaluated a fire tracking application to determine how well Agilla achieves its goals. Fire is modeled by agents that gradually spread throughout the network, engulfing nodes by inserting fire tuples into their local tuple spaces. Fire tracker agents are then used to form a perimeter around the fire. Using Agilla, we were able to rapidly create and deploy 47 byte fire agents, and 100 byte tracker agents on a WSN consisting of 26 MICA2 motes. Our experiments show that the tracker agents can form an 8-node perimeter around a burning node within 6.5 seconds and that it can adapt to a fire spreading at a rate of 7 seconds per hop. We also present the lessons learned about the adequacy of Agilla's primitives, and regarding the efficiency, reliability, and adaptivity of mobile agents in a WSN.

We present Telos, an ultra low power wireless sensor module ("mote") for research and experimentation. Telos is the latest in a line of motes developed by UC Berkeley to enable wireless sensor network (WSN) research. It is a new mote design built from scratch based on experiences with previous mote generations. Telos' new design consists of three major goals to enable experimentation: minimal power consumption, easy to use, and increased software and hardware robustness. We discuss how hardware components are selected and integrated in order to achieve these goals. Using a Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller, Chipcon IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio, and USB, Telos' power profile is almost one-tenth the consumption of previous mote platforms while providing greater performance and throughput. It eliminates programming and support boards, while enabling experimentation with WSNs in both lab, testbed, and deployment settings.

Dynamic wake-up and topology maintenance protocols with spatiotemporal guarantees

2005
Many mission-critical applications require spatiotemporal data services for mobile users or objects. Examples include distributed object tracking and fire monitoring by firefighters. To support such applications, wireless sensor networks must satisfy a set of stringent spatiotemporal constraints despite having low network duty cycles and scarce resources. We have developed two new wake-up and topology maintenance protocols, directional tree maintenance (DTM) and omnidirectional tree creation (OTC), to support spatiotemporal services in mobile environments. A key feature of our protocols is that they provide robust spatiotemporal performance while maintaining low overhead and energy consumption. Our simulations showed that both DTM and OTC can successfully deliver over 85% of query results to a mobile user within desired spatiotemporal constraints, even when the sleep schedule is as long as 15 s, the user changes direction every minute, and the location error is as high as 10 m. The benefits of our protocols have been validated through theoretical analysis and empirical results on a testbed of Mica2 motes.

A key pre-distribution scheme using deployment knowledge for wireless sensor networks

None
2005
Sensor networks pose security and privacy challenges. One challenge is how to bootstrap secure communications among nodes. Several key pre-distribution schemes have been proposed, however, they either have a high memory requirement for large networks or need a large transmission range to achieve the desired connectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel key pre-distribution scheme using deployment knowledge. In our scheme, sensor field is divided into multiple hexagonal grids and nodes are divided into groups, each of which is deployed into a grid. By using deployment knowledge, we can drastically reduce the number of potential groups from which neighbors of each node may come. Thus, a pair-wise key can be generated efficiently for each pair of neighbors. Compared to existing schemes, our scheme achieves a high connectivity with a lower memory requirement and a smaller transmission range and outperforms others in resilience against node capture attacks.

eBlocks - an enabling technology for basic sensor based systems

2005
We describe the development of a set of embedded system building blocks, known as eBlocks. An eBlock network can be viewed as a basic form of sensor network that can be developed by non-programming engineers, scientists, and others. Each eBlock has a defined function, either one of a few predefined combinational or sequential functions, a custom-programmed function defined by an automated tool, or by user with programming skills. A user creates an application simply by connecting blocks, and possibly performing simple configuration via dials and switches. We have built over 100 physical eBlock prototypes, and tested their usability with over 100 non-programming users to date. We will describe the architecture of the blocks, including design tradeoffs we considered and the benefit of an exploration tool that we developed to help optimize the power and performance of the design. We have also built a graphical eBlock simulator that users can utilize to quickly build and test systems before deployment, and that we have used in experiments with over 300 non-programming users to help us define intuitive block functions and interfaces. We will describe the simulator architecture, as well as a tool that automatically converts a user's eBlock network into a much smaller network of programmable blocks with accompanying automatically generated programs.

Tracking on a graph

None
2005
This paper considers the problem of tracking objects with sparsely located binary sensors. Tracking with a sensor network is a challenging task due to the inaccuracy of sensors and difficulties in sensor network localization. Based on the simplest sensor model, in which each sensor reports only a binary value indicating whether an object is present near the sensor or not, we present an optimal distributed tracking algorithm which does not require sensor network localization. The tracking problem is formulated as a hidden state estimation problem over the finite state space of sensors. Then a distributed tracking algorithm is derived from the Viterbi algorithm. We also describe provably good pruning strategies for scalability of the algorithm and show the conditions under which the algorithm is robust against false detections. The algorithm is also extended to handle non-disjoint sensing regions and to track multiple moving objects. Since the computation and storage of track information are done in a completely distributed manner, the method is robust against node failures and transmission failures. In addition, the use of binary sensors makes the proposed algorithm suitable for many sensor network applications.

QoM and lifetime-constrained random deployment of sensor networks for minimum energy consumption
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
We consider the problem of energy efficient random deployment of sensor network. Our goal is to find the sensor node density, or alternatively, the energy resource density at every point inside a given deployment region, which results in allocating the minimum total number of deployed sensors, or alternatively, the minimum total energy source subject to constraints on the quality of monitoring (QoM) and network lifetime. The QoM is defined as the average of spatial distortion in reconstructed signal at the base station and can be bounded for a random deployment of sensor nodes when sensors are points of a Poisson process in the deployment region. To solve the optimization problem, we first determine a node density which satisfies the QoM constraint. Next we present a continuous space model for random deployment with the associated routing scheme that can be used to provide the minimum total required energy consumption. Finally, we present a spatial distribution of the sensor nodes (or the energy resources) that can achieve this minimum total energy. Simulation result shows that the minimum total energy obtained is close to the actual energy required in a randomly deployed dense network.

The design and evaluation of a hybrid sensor network for cane-toad monitoring
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.

2005
This paper investigates a wireless, acoustic sensor network application-monitoring amphibian populations in the monsoonal woodlands of northern Australia. Our goal is to use automatic recognition of animal vocalizations to census the populations of native frogs and the invasive introduced species, the cane toad. This is a challenging application because it requires high frequency acoustic sampling, complex signal processing and wide area sensing coverage. We set up two prototypes of wireless sensor networks that recognize vocalizations of up to 9 frog species found in northern Australia. Our first prototype is simple and consists of only resource-rich Stargate devices. Our second prototype is more complex and consists of a hybrid mixture of Stargates and inexpensive, resource-poor Mica2 devices operating in concert. In the hybrid system, the Mica2s are used to collect acoustic samples, and expand the sensor network coverage. The Stargates are used for resource-intensive tasks such as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and machine learning. The hybrid system incorporates three algorithms designed to account for the sampling, processing and communication bottlenecks of the Mica2s (i) high frequency sampling, (ii) compression and noise reduction, to reduce data transmission by up to 90%, and (iii) sampling scheduling, which exploits the sensor network redundancy to increase the effective sample processing rate. We evaluate the performance of both systems over a range of scenarios, and demonstrate that the feasibility and benefits of a hybrid systems approach justify the additional system complexity.

2005
We address the problem of selecting sensors so as to minimize the error in estimating the position of a target. We consider a generic sensor model where the measurements can be interpreted as polygonal, convex subsets of the plane. This model applies to a large class of sensors including cameras. We present an approximation algorithm which guarantees that the resulting error in estimation is within a factor 2 of the least possible error. In establishing this result, we formally prove that a constant number of sensors suffice for a good estimate-an observation made by many researchers. In the second part of the paper, we study the scenario where the target's position is given by an uncertainty region and present algorithms for both probabilistic and online versions of this problem.

MASS: modular architecture for sensor systems
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
Recent advances in low power microprocessors and power storage technology have allowed for the design of a broad range of sensor network platforms. Current sensor network platforms fall into one of two main categories, low power, application specific platforms and full featured general purpose platforms with higher power consumption. The former generally consist of a power-efficient microprocessor and a few application specific resources, while the latter generally have a general purpose processor and a full complement of resources available via a GPIO interface. General purpose platforms are readily available and can be adapted to almost any application but are less efficient with respect to power consumption than application specific solutions. Application specific solutions are extremely efficient and well suited to the problem they are designed for, but are time consuming and expensive to build. MASS is a modular sensor node architecture that enables rapid development of an application specific solution. While not as power-efficient as a completely custom solution, MASS provides application flexibility while being much more efficient than common-off-the-shelf general purpose sensor platforms. Because MASS is modular in both it's software and hardware design, it is straightforward to extend both the software platform and the hardware supporting it to suit an application. What this means is that a custom sensor network solution is now available at a much lower cost, and in a much shorter time-frame than was previously available. This makes a whole new class of sensor network applications feasible.

Detecting cuts in sensor networks

We propose a low overhead scheme for detecting a network partition or cut in a sensor network. Consider a network S of n sensors, modeled as points in a two-dimensional plane. An /spl epsiv/-cut, for any 0</spl epsiv/<1, is a linear separation of /spl epsiv/n nodes in S from a distinguished node, the base station. We show that the base station can detect whenever an /spl epsiv/-cut occurs by monitoring the status of just O(1//spl epsiv/) nodes in the network. Our scheme is deterministic and it is free of false positives: no reported cut has size smaller than 1/2/spl epsiv/n. Besides this combinatorial result, we also propose efficient algorithms for finding the O(1//spl epsiv/) nodes that should act as sentinels, and report on our simulation results, comparing the sentinel algorithm with two natural schemes based on sampling.

A self-reorganizing slot allocation protocol for multi-cluster sensor networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
This paper presents a self-reorganizing slot allocation (SRSA) mechanism for TDMA based medium access control (MAC) in wireless sensor networks. With TDMA, a node can achieve significant energy savings by remaining active only during allocated slots for transmissions and receptions. In multi-cluster networks, it is often necessary for nodes to use either CDMA or FDMA for preventing interference across neighbor clusters. The goal of this paper is to provide an alternative design that can reduce inter-cluster TDMA interference without having to use spectrum expensive CDMA or FDMA. The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that with adaptive slot allocation, it is possible to reduce such interference under low loading conditions, which is often the case for sensor networks with monitoring applications. The second contribution is to design a feedback based adaptive allocation reorganization protocol that can significantly reduce those interferences without relying on any global synchronization mechanisms. We present the design of SRSA and provide a simulation based characterization of the protocol in comparison with TDMA-over-CDMA, TDMA with random slot allocation and CSMA MAC protocols. The results indicate that with moderate cluster overlapping and low traffic, SRSA can significantly reduce inter-cluster TDMA interference while delivering TDMA-over-CDMA like energy efficiency, at the cost of higher delivery latency compared to TDMA-over-CDMA. Assuming its low complexity and narrow-band operation unlike TDMA-over-CDMA, SRSA can be an ideal sensor MAC protocol for applications that can tolerate relatively larger delivery latency but not frequent packet drops.

Robust statistical methods for securing wireless localization in sensor networks

2005
Many sensor applications are being developed that require the location of wireless devices, and localization schemes have been developed to meet this need. However, as location-based services become more prevalent, the localization infrastructure will become the target of malicious attacks. These attacks will not be conventional security threats, but rather threats that adversely affect the ability of localization schemes to provide trustworthy location information. This paper identifies a list of attacks that are unique to localization algorithms. Since these attacks are diverse in nature, and there may be many unforeseen attacks that can bypass traditional security countermeasures, it is desirable to alter the underlying localization algorithms to be robust to intentionally corrupted measurements. In this paper, we develop robust statistical methods to make localization attack-tolerant. We examine two broad classes of localization: triangulation and RF-based fingerprinting methods. For triangulation-based localization, we propose an adaptive least squares and least median squares position estimator that has the computational advantages of least squares in the absence of attacks and is capable of switching to a robust mode when being attacked. We introduce robustness to fingerprinting localization through the use of a median-based distance metric. Finally, we evaluate our robust localization schemes under different threat conditions.

Environmental energy is an attractive power source for low power wireless sensor networks. We present Prometheus, a system that intelligently manages energy transfer for perpetual operation without human intervention or servicing. Combining positive attributes of different energy storage elements and leveraging the intelligence of the microprocessor, we introduce an efficient multi-stage energy transfer system that reduces the common limitations of single energy storage systems to achieve near perpetual operation. We present our design choices, tradeoffs, circuit evaluations, performance analysis, and models. We discuss the relationships between system components and identify optimal hardware choices to meet an application's needs. Finally we present our implementation of a real system that uses solar energy to power Berkeley's Telos Mote. Our analysis predicts the system will operate for 43 years under 1% load, 4 years under 10% load, and 1 year under 100% load. Our implementation uses a two stage storage system consisting of supercapacitors (primary buffer) and a lithium rechargeable battery (secondary buffer). The mote has full knowledge of power levels and intelligently manages energy transfer to maximize lifetime.

Matched source-channel communication for field estimation in wireless sensor network
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
Sensing, processing and communication must be jointly optimized for efficient operation of resource-limited wireless sensor networks. We propose a novel source-channel matching approach for distributed field estimation that naturally integrates these basic operations and facilitates a unified analysis of the impact of key parameters (number of nodes, power, field complexity) on estimation accuracy. At the heart of our approach is a distributed source-channel communication architecture that matches the spatial scale of field coherence with the spatial scale of node synchronization for phase-coherent communication: the sensor field is uniformly partitioned into multiple cells and the nodes in each cell coherently communicate simple statistics of their measurements to the destination via a dedicated noisy multiple access channel (MAC). Essentially, the optimal field estimate in each cell is implicitly computed at the destination via the coherent spatial averaging inherent in the MAC, resulting in optimal power-distortion scaling with the number of nodes. In general, smoother fields demand lower per-node power but require node synchronization over larger scales for optimal estimation. In particular, optimal mean-square distortion scaling can be achieved with sub-linear power scaling. Our results also reveal a remarkable power-density tradeoff inherent in our approach: increasing the sensor density reduces the total power required to achieve a desired distortion. A direct consequence is that consistent field estimation is possible, in principle, even with vanishing total power in the limit of high sensor density.

Communication and sensing trade-offs in decentralized mobile sensor networks: a cross-layer design approach

None
2005
In this paper we characterize the impact of imperfect communication on the performance of a decentralized mobile sensor network. We first examine and demonstrate the trade-offs between communication and sensing objectives, by determining the optimal sensor configurations when introducing imperfect communication. We further illustrate the performance degradation caused by non-ideal communication links in a decentralized mobile sensor network. To address this, we propose a decentralized motion-planning algorithm that considers communication effects. The algorithm is a cross-layer design based on the proper interface of physical and application layers. Simulation results will show the performance improvement attained by utilizing this algorithm.

On the optimal density for real-time data gathering of spatio-temporal processes in sensor networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
We consider sensor networks that measure spatio-temporal correlated processes. An important task in such settings is the reconstruction at a certain node, called the sink, of the data at all points of the field. We consider scenarios where data is time critical, so delay results in distortion, or suboptimal estimation and control. For the reconstruction, the only data available to the sink are the values measured at the nodes of the sensor network, and knowledge of the correlation structure: this results in spatial distortion of reconstruction. Also, for the sake of power efficiency, sensor nodes need to transmit their data by relaying through the other network nodes: this results in delay, and thus temporal distortion of reconstruction if time critical data is concerned. We study data gathering for the case of Gaussian processes in one- and two-dimensional grid scenarios, where we are able to write explicit expressions for the spatial and time distortion, and combine them into a single total distortion measure. We prove that, for various standard correlation structures, there is an optimal finite density of the sensor network for which the total distortion is minimized. Thus, when power efficiency and delay are both considered in data gathering, it is useless from the point of view of accuracy of the reconstruction to increase the number of sensors above a certain threshold that depends on the correlation structure characteristics.

Fading observation alignment via feedback
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
In some remote sensing applications, the functional relationship between the source being observed and the sensor readings may not be known. Because of communication constraints, this uncertainty may result in poor end-to-end distortion. If the sensors have some knowledge of their joint statistics, they may be able to communicate collaboratively to combat the channel noise. A model is proposed for capturing some of the uncertainty in the observation process, called a fading observation model. An example with fading observations is analysed. For M sensors with no fading there exists a scheme for which the achievable distortion scales with M as M/sup -1/, but with fading the distortion does not scale with M. In this paper, a one-bit feedback scheme is presented that provides enough information about the joint statistics to achieve scaling rates like M/sup -1/3/. Additional feedback improves the achievable scaling rate. For comparison, a scheme based on separate source and channel coding at best gives a distortion scaling behaviour of (log M)/sup -1/. Some extensions to multiple sources and observation models with unknown delay are discussed.

In current cooperative communication schemes, to achieve cooperative diversity, synchronization between terminals is usually assumed which may no be practical since each terminal has its own local oscillator.

Networked infomechanical systems (NIMS) introduces a new actuation capability for embedded networked sensing. By exploiting a constrained actuation method based on rapidly deployable infrastructure, NIMS suspends a network of wireless mobile and fixed sensor nodes in three-dimensional space. This permits run-time adaptation with variable sensing location, perspective, and even sensor type. Discoveries in NIMS environmental investigations have raised requirements for 1) new embedded platforms integrating many diverse sensors with actuators, and 2) advances for in-network sensor data processing. This is addressed with a new and generally applicable processor-preprocessor architecture described in this paper. Also this paper describes the successful integration of R, a powerful statistical computing environment, into the embedded NIMS node platform.

Maximizing the functional lifetime of sensor networks
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
The functional lifetime of a sensor network is defined as the maximum number of times a certain data collection function or task can be carried out without any node running out of energy. The specific task considered in this paper is that of communicating a specified quantity of information from each sensor to a collector node. The problem of finding the communication scheme which maximizes functional lifetime can be formulated as a linear program, under "fluid-like" assumptions on information bits. This paper focuses on analytically solving the linear program for some simple regular network topologies. The two topologies considered are a regular linear array, and a regular two-dimensional network. In the linear case, an upper bound on functional lifetime is derived, as a function of the initial energies and quantities of data held by the sensors. Under some assumptions on the relative amounts of the energies and data, this upper bound is shown to be achievable, and the exact form of the optimal communication strategy is derived. For the regular planar network, upper and lower bounds on functional lifetime, differing only by a constant factor, are obtained. Finally, it is shown that the simple collection scheme of transmitting only to nearest neighbors, yields a nearly optimal lifetime in a scaling sense.

Robust computation of aggregates in wireless sensor networks: distributed randomized algorithms and analysis

None
2005
A wireless sensor network consists of a large number of small, resource-constrained devices and usually operates in hostile environments that are prone to link and node failures. Computing aggregates such as average, minimum, maximum and sum is fundamental to various primitive functions of a sensor network like system monitoring, data querying, and collaborative information processing. In this paper we present and analyze a suite of randomized distributed algorithms to efficiently and robustly compute aggregates. Our distributed random grouping (DRG) algorithm is simple and natural and uses probabilistic grouping to progressively converge to the aggregate value. DRG is local and randomized and is naturally robust against dynamic topology changes from link/node failures. Although our algorithm is natural and simple, it is nontrivial to show that it converges to the correct aggregate value and to bound the time needed for convergence. Our analysis uses the eigen-structure of the underlying graph in a novel way to show convergence and to bound the running time of our algorithms. We also present simulation results of our algorithm and compare its performance to various other known distributed algorithms. Simulations show that DRG needs much less transmissions than other distributed localized schemes, namely gossip and broadcast flooding.

Maximizing system lifetime in wireless sensor networks

2005
Maximizing system lifetime in battery-powered wireless sensor networks with power aware topology control protocols and routing protocols has received intensive research. In the past, this problem has been mostly studied from the indirect perspective of energy conservation. Although this leads to solutions that help extend network lifetime, energy conservation is not the same problem as network lifetime maximization. Some researchers have formally studied network lifetime maximization problems, based on the assumption that energy is only consumed by packet transmission. However, it is well known that in many cases energy is significantly consumed during idle periods and overhearing. In this paper, we try to present a survey and formal analysis of a variety of network lifetime maximization problems in different energy consumption models. In particular, we identify different energy consumption models, define a variety of fundamental network lifetime maximization problems in individual energy consumption models, and formally analyze their complexities. Polynomial time algorithms are presented for tractable problems, and NP-hardness proofs are presented for intractable problems.

Data fusion in sensor networks

2005
Summary form only given. There is a growing excitement about the potential application of large scale sensor networks in diverse applications such as precision agriculture, geophysical and environment monitoring, remote health care, and security. Rapid progress in sensing hardware, communications and low-power computing has resulted in a profusion of commercially available sensor nodes. The big challenge now is to develop effective methods for the automatic fusion and interpretation of the information generated by large-scale sensor networks. The success of future applications is predicated on finding solutions to this data fusion challenge. This talk will focus on probabilistic models and Bayesian data fusion methods appropriate to describing and solving sensor network data fusion problems. Over a number of years, we have used such methods to develop decentralised algorithms for point-target estimation in sensor networks. More recently, other researchers have developed distributed Bayesian algorithms for sensor networks to estimate field properties, such as temperature or humidity over an area. The prospect of developing holistic Bayesian methods for fusion in sensor networks now looks to be a real and exciting possibility. This talk will describe these potential developments. Notions of divergence and information appear naturally in probabilistic fusion algorithms. In turn these provide a handle on two other sensor network data fusion problems; how to model and manage sensor node performance and how to learn patterns in or interpret sensor network information. These ideas will also be developed in this talk. Interspersed amongst these developments we will describe some real sensor network applications, some solved, some currently being addressed, and some that remain as a challenge to network data fusion methods.

Towards optimal sleep scheduling in sensor networks for rare-event detection
IPSN 2005. Fourth International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks, 2005.
None
2005
Lifetime maximization is one key element in the design of sensor-network-based surveillance applications. We propose a protocol for node sleep scheduling that guarantees a bounded-delay sensing coverage while maximizing network lifetime. Our sleep scheduling ensures that coverage rotates such that each point in the environment is sensed within some finite interval of time, called the detection delay. The framework is optimized for rare event detection and allows favorable compromises to be achieved between event detection delay and lifetime without sacrificing (eventual) coverage for each point. We compare different sleep scheduling policies in terms of average detection delay, and show that ours is closest to the detection delay lower bound for stationary event surveillance. We also explain the inherent relationship between detection delay, which applies to persistent events, and detection probability, which applies to temporary events. Finally, a connectivity maintenance protocol is proposed to minimize the delay of multi-hop delivery to a base-station. The resulting sleep schedule achieves the lowest overall target surveillance delay given constraints on energy consumption.

Building up to macroprogramming: an intermediate language for sensor networks

2005
There is widespread agreement that a higher level programming model for sensor networks is needed. A variety of models have been developed, but the community is far from consensus. We propose an intermediate language to speed up the exploration of this design space. Our language, called the token machine language (TML) can be targeted by compilers for higher level systems. TML provides a layer of abstraction for a lower-level runtime environment, such as TinyOS. TML is intended to capture coordinated activity in a sensor network. Notable features of TML are its atomic action model of concurrency, and its unification of communication, control, and storage around the concept of a token. Tokens are small objects, typically under a hundred bytes, and can be disseminated across the network. A token causes computation upon its arrival at a site by invoking a token handler. The effect of the computation is to atomically change the token's own state as well as the state of shared variables at the site.

Wireless sensor networks are collections of autonomous devices with computational, sensing and wireless communication capabilities. Research in this area has been growing in the past few years given the wide range of applications that can benefit from such a technology. In this paper, the development of a highly modular and miniaturized wireless platform for sensor networks is described. The system incorporates a radio transceiver (in the 2.4 GHz ISM Band) with embedded protocol software to minimize power consumption and maximize data throughput. Additional input capability for sensor and actuator integration can be incorporated seamlessly due to the modular nature of the system. The total system is packaged in a modular 25 mm cubed form factor. A smaller, (10 mm cubed), prototype is currently under development. Ongoing development of highly miniaturized nodes is discussed.

Summary form only given. While research in sensorwebs often focuses on extremely low-power, inexpensive sensors coupled with ad hoc, occasionally-connected networks, the recent tragic tsunami associated with the Sumatra earthquake leading to the loss of more than 280,000 lives in the Indian Ocean demands a fresh look at networks and grids on a global scale often involving highly sophisticated sensors. The extraordinary growth in network bandwidth coupled with initiatives such as the not-for-profit National Lambda Rail has enhanced grid computing and grid storage technologies making a truly global sensorweb not only possible, but also imperative. The same system lowers most barriers to scientific research on vast amounts of new data and lowers the costs of operations and maintenance. The Earth and planetary sciences are moving toward an interactive global observation capability necessitating a new generation of cyberinfrastructure. At UCSD and Scripps NSF ITR projects including ROADNet, LOOKING, and the OptIPuter are prototyping real time control of remote instruments, visualization of large data objects, metadata searching of federated data repositories, and collaborative analysis of complex simulations and observations. A single-purpose national or global warning system, for tsunamis for example, is nearly impossible to maintain because of the time scales of major events - decades to centuries. However, a broad, scientifically based, multipurpose system can be maintained and will grow as new technologies become available and new approaches in cyberinfrastructure replace the old.

Near-optimal sensor placements: maximizing information while minimizing communication cost
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
When monitoring spatial phenomena with wireless sensor networks, selecting the best sensor placements is a fundamental task. Not only should the sensors be informative, but they should also be able to communicate efficiently. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that addresses the three central aspects of this problem: measuring the predictive quality of a set of sensor locations (regardless of whether sensors were ever placed at these locations), predicting the communication cost involved with these placements, and designing an algorithm with provable quality guarantees that optimizes the NP-hard tradeoff. Specifically, we use data from a pilot deployment to build non-parametric probabilistic models called Gaussian Processes (GPs) both for the spatial phenomena of interest and for the spatial variability of link qualities, which allows us to estimate predictive power and communication cost of un-sensed locations. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the representation of link qualities plays an important role in estimating communication costs. Using these models, we present a novel, polynomial-time, data-driven algorithm, pSPIEL, which selects Sensor Placements at Informative and cost-Effective Locations. Our approach exploits two important properties of this problem: submodularity, formalizing the intuition that adding a node to a small deployment can help more than adding a node to a large deployment; and locality, under which nodes that are far from each other provide almost independent information. Exploiting these properties, we prove strong approximation guarantees for our pSPlEL approach. We also provide extensive experimental validation of this practical approach on several real-world placement problems, and built a complete system implementation on 46 Tmote Sky motes, demonstrating significant advantages over existing methods

Utility-based sensor selection
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Sensor networks consist of many small sensing devices that monitor an environment and communicate using wireless links. The lifetime of these networks is severely curtailed by the limited battery power of the sensors. One line of research in sensor network lifetime management has examined sensor selection techniques, in which applications judiciously choose which sensors' data should be retrieved and are worth the expended energy. In the past, many ad-hoc approaches for sensor selection have been proposed. In this paper, we argue that sensor selection should be based upon a tradeoff between application-perceived benefit and energy consumption of the selected sensor set. We propose a framework wherein the application can specify the utility of measuring data (nearly) concurrently at each set of sensors. The goal is then to select a sequence of sets to measure whose total utility is maximized, while not exceeding the available energy. Alternatively, we may look for the most cost-effective sensor set, maximizing the product of utility and system lifetime. This approach is very generic, and permits us to model many applications of sensor networks. We proceed to study two important classes of utility functions: submodular and supermodular functions. We show that the optimum solution for submodular functions can be found in polynomial time, while optimizing the cost-effectiveness of supermodular functions is NP-hard. For a practically important subclass of supermodular functions, we present an LP-based solution if nodes can send for different amounts of time, and show that we can achieve an O(log n) approximation ratio if each node has to send for the same amount of time. Finally, we study scenarios in which the quality of measurements is naturally expressed in terms of distances from targets. We show that the utility-based approach is analogous to a penalty-based approach in those scenarios, and present preliminary results on some practically important special cases

Global connectivity from local geometric constraints for sensor networks with various wireless footprints
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Adaptive power topology control (APTC) is a local algorithm for constructing a one-parameter family of thetas-graphs, where each node increases power until it has a neighbor in every thetas sector around it. We show it is possible to use such a local geometric thetas-constraint to ensure full network connectivity, and consider tradeoffs between assumptions about the wireless footprint and constraints on the boundary nodes. In particular, we show that if the boundary nodes can communicate with neighboring boundary nodes and all interior nodes satisfy a thetas<sub>I</sub>&lt;pi constraint, we can guarantee connectivity for any arbitrary wireless footprint. If we relax the boundary assumption and instead impose a thetas<sub>B</sub>&lt;3pi/2 constraint on the boundary nodes, together with the thetas<sub>I</sub>&lt;pi constraint on interior nodes, we can guarantee full network connectivity using only a "weak-monotonicity" footprint assumption. The weak-monotonicity model, introduced herein, is much less restrictive than the disk model of coverage and captures aspects of the spatial correlations inherent in signal propagation and noise. We show that under the idealized disk model of coverage, APTC constructs graphs that are sparse. Finally, we show that if the wireless footprint has sufficiently small "eccentricity\

Camera networks are perhaps the most common type of sensor network and are deployed in a variety of real-world applications including surveillance, intelligent environments and scientific remote monitoring. A key problem in deploying a network of cameras is calibration, i.e., determining the location and orientation of each sensor so that observations in an image can be mapped to locations in the real world. This paper proposes a fully distributed approach for camera network calibration. The cameras collaborate to track an object that moves through the environment and reason probabilistically about which camera poses are consistent with the observed images. This reasoning employs sophisticated techniques for handling the difficult nonlinearities imposed by projective transformations, as well as the dense correlations that arise between distant cameras. Our method requires minimal overlap of the cameras' fields of view and makes very few assumptions about the motion of the object. In contrast to existing approaches, which are centralized, our distributed algorithm scales easily to very large camera networks. We evaluate the system on a real camera network with 25 nodes as well as simulated camera networks of up to 50 cameras and demonstrate that our approach performs well even when communication is lossy

Data gathering tours in sensor networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
A basic task in sensor networks is to interactively gather data from a subset of the sensor nodes. When data needs to be gathered from a selected set of nodes in the network, existing communication schemes often behave poorly. In this paper, we study the algorithmic challenges in efficiently routing a fixed-size packet through a small number of nodes in a sensor network, picking up data as the query is routed. We show that computing the optimal routing scheme to visit a specific set of nodes is NP-complete, but we develop approximation algorithms that produce plans with costs within a constant factor of the optimum. We enhance the robustness of our initial approach to accommodate the practical issues of limited-sized packets as well as network link and node failures, and examine how different approaches behave with dynamic changes in the network topology. Our theoretical results are validated via an implementation of our algorithms on the TinyOS platform and a controlled simulation study using Matlab and TOSSIM

Active learning for adaptive mobile sensing networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
This paper investigates data-adaptive path planning schemes for wireless networks of mobile sensor platforms. We focus on applications of environmental monitoring, in which the goal is to reconstruct a spatial map of environmental factors of interest. Traditional sampling theory deals with data collection processes that are completely independent of the target map to be estimated, aside from possible a priori specifications reflective of assumed properties of the target. We refer to such processes as passive learning methods. Alternatively, one can envision sequential, adaptive data collection procedures that use information gleaned from previous observations to guide the process. We refer to such feedback-driven processes as active learning methods. Active learning is naturally suited to mobile path planning, in which previous samples are used to guide the motion of the mobiles for further sampling. This paper presents some of the most encouraging theoretical results to date that support the effectiveness of active over passive learning, and focuses on new results regarding the capabilities of active learning methods for mobile sensing. Tradeoffs between latency, path lengths, and accuracy are carefully assessed using our theory. Adaptive path planning methods are developed to guide mobiles in order to focus attention in interesting regions of the sensing domain, thus conducting spatial surveys much more rapidly while maintaining the accuracy of the estimated map. The theory and methods are illustrated in the application of water current mapping in a freshwater lake

Geographic gossip: efficient aggregation for sensor networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Gossip algorithms for aggregation have recently received significant attention for sensor network applications because of their simplicity and robustness in noisy and uncertain environments. However, gossip algorithms can waste significant energy by essentially passing around redundant information multiple times. For realistic sensor network model topologies like grids and random geometric graphs, the inefficiency of gossip schemes is caused by slow mixing times of random walks on those graphs. We propose and analyze an alternative gossiping scheme that exploits geographic information. By utilizing a simple resampling method, we can demonstrate substantial gains over previously proposed gossip protocols. In particular, for random geometric graphs, our algorithm computes the true average to accuracy 1/na using O(n1.5radic(logn)) radio transmissions, which reduces the energy consumption by a radic(n/logn) factor over standard gossip algorithms

Differential games in large-scale sensor-actuator networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Surveillance systems based on sensor network technology have been shown to successfully detect, classify and track targets of interest over a large area. State information collected via the sensor network also enables these systems to actuate mobile agents so as to achieve surveillance goals such as target capture and asset protection. But satisfying these goals is complicated by the fact that track information in a sensor network is routed to mobile agents through multi-hop communication links and is thus subject to delays and losses. In addition, as the sensor network is scaled in size, high throughput rates for all pursuers cannot be sustained at all times, which necessitates a network communication strategy that adapts to pursuer information requirements. In this paper, we concentrate on the formulation of optimal pursuit control strategies in the presence of network effects, assuming that target track information has been established locally in the sensor network. We adapt ideas from the theory of differential games to networked games-including ones involving non-periodic track updates, message losses and message delays-to derive optimal strategies, bounds on the information requirements, and scaling properties of these bounds. Moreover, we present a specific network communication protocol which has the required scalable information characteristics and conclude with the results of experimental studies

Active wireless sensing for rapid information retrieval in sensor networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Most existing information extraction schemes in sensor networks rely on in-network processing that requires information routing and coordination between sensor nodes and incurs a corresponding overhead in delay and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a viable alternative-active wireless sensing (AWS)-in which a wireless information retriever (WIR) queries a select ensemble of nodes to obtain desired information in a rapid and energy-efficient manner. AWS has two primary attributes: i) the sensor nodes are "dumb" in that they have limited computational ability, and ii) the WIR, is computationally powerful, is equipped with an antenna array, and directly interrogates the sensor ensemble with wideband space-time waveforms. AWS is inspired by an intimate connection with communication over multipath channels: the sensor nodes act as active scatterers and produce a multipath response to the WIR's interrogation signals. We develop the basic communication architecture in AWS and explore various signaling and reception strategies at the WIR, and encoding strategies at the sensors. The basic communication architecture is quite flexible and can cater to a variety of information retrieval tasks. In particular, we illustrate the framework in two extreme information retrieval tasks: high-rate information retrieval corresponding to distributed independent sensor measurements, and low-rate retrieval corresponding to localized correlated measurements. A low-complexity interference suppression technique is proposed for significantly increasing the capacity and reliability of high-rate information retrieval. Performance analysis reveals a fundamental rate versus reliability tradeoff in AWS and is illustrated with accompanying simulation results

Kinetically stable task assignment for networks of microservers
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
This paper studies task assignment in a network of resource constrained computing platforms (called microservers). A task is an abstraction of a computational agent or data that is hosted by the microservers. For example, in an object tracking scenario, a task represents a mobile tracking agent, such as a vehicle location update computation, that runs on microservers, which can receive sensor data pertaining to the object of interest. Due to object motion, the microservers that can observe a particular object change over time and there is overhead involved in migrating tasks among microservers. Furthermore, communication, processing, or memory constraints, allow a microserver to only serve a limited number of objects at the same time. Our overall goal is to assign tasks to microservers so as to minimize the number of migrations, and thus be kinetically stable, while guaranteeing that as many tasks as possible are monitored at all times. When the task trajectories are known in advance, we show that this problem is NP-complete (even over just two time steps), has an integrality gap of at least 2, and can be solved optimally in polynomial time if we allow tasks to be assigned fractionally. When only probabilistic information about future movement of the tasks is known, we propose two algorithms: a multi-commodity flow based algorithm and a maximum matching algorithm. We use simulations to compare the performance of these algorithms against the optimum task allocation strategy

Random distributed multiresolution representations with significance querying
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
We propose random distributed multiresolution representations of sensor network data, so that the most significant encoding coefficients are easily accessible by querying a few sensors, anywhere in the network. Less significant encoding coefficients are available by querying a larger number of sensors, local to the region of interest. Significance can be defined in a multiresolution way, without any prior knowledge of the source data, as global summaries versus local details. Alternatively, significance can be defined in a data-adaptive way, as large differences between neighboring data values. We propose a distributed encoding algorithm that is robust to arbitrary wireless communication connectivity graphs, where links can fail or change with time. This randomized algorithm allows distributed computation that does not require strict global coordination or awareness of network connectivity at individual sensors. Because computations involve sensors in local neighborhoods of the communication graph, they are communication-efficient. Our framework uses local interaction among sensors to enable flexible information retrieval at the global level

Slip surface localization in wireless sensor networks for landslide prediction
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
A landslide occurs when the balance between a hill's weight and the countering resistance forces is tipped in favor of gravity. While the physics governing the interplay between these competing forces is fairly well understood, prediction of landslides has been hindered thus far by the lack of field measurements over large temporal and spatial scales necessary to capture the inherent heterogeneity in a landslide. We propose a network of sensor columns deployed at hills with landslide potential with the purpose of detecting the early signals preceding a catastrophic event. Detection is performed through a three-stage algorithm: First, sensors collectively detect small movements consistent with the formation of a slip surface separating the sliding part of hill from the static one. Once the sensors agree on the presence of such a surface, they conduct a distributed voting algorithm to separate the subset of sensors that moved from the static ones. In the second phase, moved sensors self-localize through a trilateration mechanism and their displacements are calculated. Finally, the direction of the displacements as well as the locations of the moved nodes are used to estimate the position of the slip surface. This information along with collected soil measurements (e.g. soil pore pressures) are subsequently passed to a finite element model that predicts whether and when a landslide will occur. Our initial results from simulated landslides indicate that we can achieve accuracy in the order of cm in the localization as well as the slip surface estimation steps of our algorithm. This accuracy persists as the density and the size of the sensor network decreases as well as when considerable noise is present in the ranging estimates. As for our next step, we plan to evaluate the performance of our system in controlled environments under a variety of hill configurations

Coverage for target localization in wireless sensor networks

None
2006
Target tracking and localization are important applications in wireless sensor networks. Although the coverage problem for target detection has been intensively studied, few consider the coverage problem from the perspective of target localization. In this paper, we propose two methods to estimate the necessary sensor density which can guarantee a localization error bound over the sensing field. In the first method, we convert the coverage problem for localization to a conventional disk coverage problem, where the sensing area is a disk centered around the sensor. Our results show that the disk coverage model requires 4 times more sensors for tracking compared to detection applications. We then introduce the idea of sector coverage, which can satisfy the same coverage conditions with 2 times less sensors over the disk coverage approach. This shows that conventional disk coverage model is insufficient for tracking applications, since it overestimates the sensor density by two times. Simulation results show that the network density requirements derived through sector coverage are close to the actual need for target tracking applications

Error propagation in dense wireless networks with cooperation

None
2006
We study error propagation in wireless cooperative broadcast protocols. In our model, nodes in the network are randomly deployed in a fixed region. The message from a certain source node is relayed by multiple groups of cooperating relays that are located in predetermined consecutive swaths of the network area. We refer to these groups of relays as "levels". Our analysis is based on the derivation of recursive equations that express the error rate at each relay in a given level as a function of the error probabilities of the nodes in the previous levels. To provide analytical results we take the limit as the number of nodes goes to infinity while the relay power goes to zero, so that the relay power density per unit area is constant. In the limit, we show that the relay power density and area of the regions that correspond to the levels lead to fixed points in the error rate that prevent catastrophic error propagation, regardless of the distance the message is transmitted over

Compressive wireless sensing
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Compressive sampling is an emerging theory that is based on the fact that a relatively small number of random projections of a signal can contain most of its salient information. In this paper, we introduce the concept of compressive wireless sensing for sensor networks in which a fusion center retrieves signal field information from an ensemble of spatially distributed sensor nodes. Energy and bandwidth are scarce resources in sensor networks and the relevant metrics of interest in our context are 1) the latency involved in information retrieval; and 2) the associated power-distortion trade-off. It is generally recognized that given sufficient prior knowledge about the sensed data (e.g., statistical characterization, homogeneity etc.), there exist schemes that have very favorable power-distortion-latency trade-offs. We propose a distributed matched source-channel communication scheme, based in part on recent results in compressive sampling theory, for estimation of sensed data at the fusion center and analyze, as a function of number of sensor nodes, the trade-offs between power, distortion and latency. Compressive wireless sensing is a universal scheme in the sense that it requires no prior knowledge about the sensed data. This universality, however, comes at the cost of optimality (in terms of a less favorable power-distortion-latency trade-off) and we quantify this cost relative to the case when sufficient prior information about the sensed data is assumed

Sweeps over wireless sensor networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
We present a robust approach to data collection, aggregation, and dissemination problems in sensor networks. Our method is based on the idea of a sweep over the network: a wavefront that traverses the network, passes over each node exactly once, and performs the desired operation(s). We do not require global information about the sensor field such as node locations. Instead, in a preprocessing phase, we compute a potential function over the network whose gradients guide the sweep process. The sweep itself operates asynchronously, using only local operations to advance the wave-front. The gradient information provides a local ordering of the nodes that helps reduce the number of MAC-layer collisions as the wavefront advances, while also globally shaping the wavefront so as to conform to the sensor field layout. The approach is robust to both link volatility and node failures that may be present in real network conditions. The potential is computed by a stable diffusion process in which each node repeatedly set its potential to the average of the potentials of its neighbors. Aggregation paths are decided on-line as the sweep proceeds and no fixed tree structure is needed over the course of the computation. We present simulation results illustrating the correctness of the algorithm and comparing the performance of the sweep to aggregation trees under various network conditions

CAPTRA: coordinated packet traceback
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Network-based attacks can be either persistent or sporadic. Persistent attack flows can be relatively easy to trace by mechanisms such as probabilistic packet marking, traffic logging, data mining etc. Sporadic attacks are sometimes easily detected by the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) at the victims, but are hard to trace back to the attack origins. We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance

On the interdependence of sensing and estimation complexity in sensor networks

2006
Computing the exact maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimate of the environment is computationally expensive in many practical distributed sensing settings. We argue that this computational difficulty can be overcome by increasing the number of sensor measurements. Based on our work on the connection between error correcting codes and sensor networks, we propose a new algorithm, which extends the idea of sequential decoding used to decode convolutional codes to estimation in a sensor network. In a simulated distributed sensing application, this algorithm provides accurate estimates at a modest computational cost given a sufficient number of sensor measurements. Above a certain number of sensor measurements this algorithm exhibits a sharp transition in the number of steps it requires in order to converge, leading to the potentially counter-intuitive observation that the computational burden of estimation can be reduced by taking additional sensor measurements

A space-time diffusion scheme for peer-to-peer least-squares estimation
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
We consider a sensor network in which each sensor takes measurements, at various times, of some unknown parameters, corrupted by independent Gaussian noises. Each node can take a finite or infinite number of measurements, at arbitrary times (i.e., asynchronously). We propose a space-time diffusion scheme that relies only on peer-to-peer communication, and allows every node to asymptotically compute the global maximum-likelihood estimate of the unknown parameters. At each iteration, information is diffused across the network by a temporal update step and a spatial update step. Both steps update each node's state by a weighted average of its current value and locally available data: new measurements for the time update, and neighbors' data for the spatial update. At any time, any node can compute a local weighted least-squares estimate of the unknown parameters, which converges to the global maximum-likelihood solution. With an infinite number of measurements, these estimates converge to the true parameter values in the sense of mean-square convergence. We show that this scheme is robust to unreliable communication links, and works in a network with dynamically changing topology

This paper develops a new framework for distributed coding and compression in sensor networks based on distributed compressed sensing (DCS). DCS exploits both intra-signal and inter-signal correlations through the concept of joint sparsity; just a few measurements of a jointly sparse signal ensemble contain enough information for reconstruction. DCS is well-suited for sensor network applications, thanks to its simplicity, universality, computational asymmetry, tolerance to quantization and noise, robustness to measurement loss, and scalability. It also requires absolutely no inter-sensor collaboration. We apply our framework to several real world datasets to validate the framework

We consider a wired network of analog sensors in one dimension. Each sensor measures some physical quantity and "communicates" with its adjacent neighbors. The base station can access the network by communicating with the sensors at the boundaries. We show that by making measurements at the boundary (i.e. from the first sensor) we can determine the values of the unknown field values along the entire network stably. The method is based on building an analogy with classical one dimensional inverse scattering (Helmholtz equation) for which the Chen-Rokhlin algorithm provides a highly surprising stable method for recovering the scattering parameters.

Analytic modeling of detection latency in mobile sensor networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
An envisioned usage of sensor networks is in surveillance systems for detecting a target or monitoring a physical phenomenon in a region. Traditionally, stationary sensor networks are deployed to carry out the sensing operations. In many applications, if the monitored region is relatively large compared to the sensing range of a node, a large number of nodes are required in the region to achieve high coverage. Using mobile nodes in such situations can be an attractive alternative. Mobility of sensor nodes has been studied in sensor networks for many purposes such as power saving, data collection, and packet delivery. However, nearly all research literature for the target detection problem has focused on stationary sensor networks. This paper investigates the problem of detecting the presence/absence of a target using mobile sensor networks. It presents an analytic method to evaluate the detection latency based on a collaborative sensing approach using nodes with uncoordinated mobility. We verify the analytic model through simulations. The analytic method provides a simple way of analyzing the tradeoff between number of nodes and detection latency in a mobile sensor network. The analysis is also used to compare the performance of mobile and stationary sensor networks with respect to these measures. Results show that if the target is present at the worst possible location in a given deployment, then detection latency of mobile sensor networks is considerably less as compared to that of stationary networks with the same number of nodes

Effects of A-D conversion nonidealities on distributed sampling in dense sensor networks

2006
We address the effect of the errors occurring at the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), from quantization noise, circuit noise, aperture uncertainty and comparator ambiguity, on the accuracy of sensor field reconstruction. We focus on the oversampling of bandlimited sensor fields in a distributed processing environment. It has previously been shown that pulse code modulation (PCM) style sampling fails to decrease the quantization error above some finite sampling rate. We show that the dither-based scheme, developed to decrease the quantization error, fails to decrease random errors associated with circuit noise, aperture uncertainty and comparator ambiguity. We propose an advanced dither-based sampling scheme with the goal of reducing both kinds of errors by increasing the density of the sensor nodes. It is based on distributing the task of improving the quantization error and random error among the nodes. The error of the scheme is shown to be O(1/rfrac12) for oversampling rate r. The maximum energy consumption per node is O(log(r)). Finally, the bit rate of the scheme is O(1/rfrac12log(r)) and it offers robustness to node failures in terms of a graceful degradation of reconstruction error

SmartGossip: an improved randomized broadcast protocol for sensor networks

2006
We investigate four performance metrics for randomized broadcast protocols on sensor networks: the fraction of nodes that receive the message (coverage), the number of first-time receivers per transmission (energy efficiency), the node-average normalized time till reception (per hop latency), and the average number of control messages per node (overhead). Our focus is to evaluate the extent to which the exchange of local information (either active or passive) can improve protocol performance. To this end, we study via simulation three protocols from the literature that exploit local information and compare their performance against the well known GOSSIP1 protocol, which does not employ any local information in making transmission decisions. Our findings are that i) local information is of course quite valuable in increasing protocol performance, and ii) it is possible to obtain high coverage and efficiency but one must then incur either increased delay or increased overhead. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the above protocols and propose the new SmartGossip protocol, which combines several ideas from the above protocols, as well as several new mechanisms, to achieve superior performance

Sleep scheduling and lifetime maximization in sensor networks: fundamental limits and optimal solutions
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Energy efficiency is a very critical consideration in the design of low cost sensor networks, which typically have fairly low node battery life. This raises the need for providing periodic sleep cycles for the radios in the sensor nodes. Keeping sensors in sleep state also implies that node to sink communication incurs certain delays and there exists a threshold on the duty cycling for the communication delay to be bounded, giving rise to an upperbound on the lifetime of the network i.e., the time until at least one node in the network is able to communicate its sensed data to the sink. This paper aims at establishing tight analytical bounds on the sleeping probabilities of nodes and on the achievable lifetime of wireless sensor networks in a very generic setting. Bounds on the sleeping probability need to be satisfied for proper network functionality. Further, an energy efficient deployment scheme is suggested wherein the battery power depletion is fairly uniformly deployed throughout the network. This scheme makes use of the availability of low power auxiliary channel listening radio. With this scheme, we shown that an improvement in lifetime by a factor of O(radicn/log n) over uniform distribution of nodes is achievable, where n is the number of nodes in the network. We also show that the throughput capacity of the network is also improved by the same factor. We show also that the maximum lifetime of the network is bounded above by O(n3/2/radiclog n). Further, the accuracy of our analysis is verified by the simulation results presented

Structuring contention-based channel access in wireless sensor networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
In a wireless network using CSMA for MAC, packet collisions can result either because of the vulnerability stemming from the idle channel detection delay of the radio device or because of the hidden terminal problem. Both of these collision scenarios can be addressed by applying some additional structure to carrier sense-based channel access, sacrificing throughput to improve collision protection. Specifically, we assign a unique time slice to each contending transmitter that is designed to allow collision-free access to each data slot while still using carrier sense as the mechanism to determine channel state. The width of each time slice is equal to the idle channel detection delay of the radio.

eSENSE: energy efficient stochastic sensing framework for wireless sensor platforms
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Energy is a precious resource in wireless sensor networks as sensor nodes are typically powered by batteries with high replacement cost. This paper presents eSENSE: an energy-efficient stochastic sensing framework for wireless sensor platforms. eSENSE is a node-level framework that utilizes knowledge of the underlying data streams as well as application data quality requirements to conserve energy on a sensor node. eSENSE employs a stochastic scheduling algorithm to dynamically control the operating modes of the sensor node components. This scheduling algorithm enables an adaptive sampling strategy that aggressively conserves power by adjusting sensing activity to the application requirements. Using experimental results obtained on power-TOSSIM with a real-world data trace, we demonstrate that our approach reduces energy consumption by 29-36% while providing strong statistical guarantees on data quality

An architecture for distributed wavelet analysis and processing in sensor networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
Distributed wavelet processing within sensor networks holds promise for reducing communication energy and wireless bandwidth usage at sensor nodes. Local collaboration among nodes decorrelates measurements, yielding a sparser data set with significant values at far fewer nodes. Sparsity can then be leveraged for subsequent processing such as measurement compression, denoising, and query routing. A number of factors complicate realizing such a transform in real-world deployments, including irregular spatial placement of nodes and a potentially prohibitive energy cost associated with calculating the transform in-network. In this paper, we address these concerns head-on; our contributions are fourfold. First, we propose a simple interpolatory wavelet transform for irregular sampling grids. Second, using ns-2 simulations of network traffic generated by the transform, we establish for a variety of network configurations break-even points in network size beyond which multiscale data processing provides energy savings. Distributed lossy compression of network measurements provides a representative application for this study. Third, we develop a new protocol for extracting approximations given only a vague notion of source statistics and analyze its energy savings over a more intuitive but naive approach. Finally, we extend the 2-dimensional (2-D) spatial irregular grid transform to a 3-D spatio-temporal transform, demonstrating the substantial gain of distributed 3-D compression over repeated 2-D compression

A sensory grammar for inferring behaviors in sensor networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
The ability of a sensor network to parse out observable activities into a set of distinguishable actions is a powerful feature that can potentially enable many applications of sensor networks to everyday life situations. In this paper we introduce a framework that uses a hierarchy of probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) to perform such parsing. The power of the framework comes from the hierarchical organization of grammars that allows the use of simple local sensor measurements for reasoning about more macroscopic behaviors. Our presentation describes how to use a set of phonemes to construct grammars and how to achieve distributed operation using a messaging model. The proposed framework is flexible. It can be mapped to a network hierarchy or can be applied sequentially and across the network to infer behaviors as they unfold in space and time. We demonstrate this functionality by inferring simple motion patterns using a sequence of simple direction vectors obtained from our camera sensor network testbed

A new class of abstract sensor networks is introduced and analyzed. The object of the sensing is the inter-node channel. Examples of systems which seek to sense the channel include: underwater sonar, radar and optics based atmospheric sensor networks. In these networks, the sensing and communication tasks share the bandwidth resource in addition to the sharing of power resources as has been conventionally studied in the sensor network framework. Bounds on distortion tradeoffs are developed for various protocols, such as source coding analogues of decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward and simple topologies such as two-hop networks (three node system)

Sensor network technology can revolutionize the study of animal ecology by providing a means of non-intrusive, simultaneous, unmanned monitoring. In this paper, we investigate the design, analysis, and testing of acoustic arrays for localizing bird vocalizations of different species. The spectra of the bird waveforms affect the desired dimension of the array. Microphones are placed in a uniform circular array and are finely synchronized within a few microseconds. We apply the approximate maximum likelihood (AML) method to estimate the source direction-of-arrival (DOA) and perform beamforming for signal enhancement. The crossing of the distributed DOA estimated bearings is used to localize the birds, and the enhanced signals axe used for training and estimation for the classification of the birds. The experimental results demonstrate the practicality and robustness of our array design

CRBcast: a collaborative rateless scheme for reliable and energy-efficient broadcasting in wireless sensor networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
In this paper, we propose a two-phase broadcasting scheme referred as collaborative rateless broadcast (CRBcast). We are particularly interested in reliability and energy efficiency of the broadcasting scheme for multi-hop wireless sensor networks. Our two-phase protocol is based on probabilistic broadcasting (PBcast) and an application layer rateless coding. At the first phase, the rateless-encoded packets are broadcasted based on PBcast, in which each node probabilistically relays every new received packet. The second recovery phase, which is based on simple collaborations of nodes, ensures that all nodes can recover original data. We first investigate PBcast analytically and with simulation, since the characteristics of PBcast influence CRBcast. Then, we investigate the effectiveness of CRBcast. We show that CRBcast can provide both reliability and energy efficiency. Simulation results indicate that CRBcast saves at least 72% and 60% energy in comparison with flooding and PBcast, respectively

Energy-driven detection scheme with guaranteed accuracy
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
This is our first step towards a holistic investigation of the minimum energy for wireless sensor network (WSN) to perform a specific function. We consider wireless sensor networks that perform an event detection function. Each sensor node will repetitively collect a 1-bit information regarding whether the event occurs or not in its neighborhood. A fusion center will make the decision on whether the event occurs based on the information provided by individual sensor nodes. Traditionally, a centralized scheme requires each sensor node to forward all its observations to the fusion center, which results in large energy in communication. A distributed scheme, on the other hand, allows each sensor node to make its own decision and then send out only its 1-bit decision. This reduces communication energy at the cost of increased processing energy and reduced detection accuracy. We propose a hybrid energy-driven scheme where each sensor node sends out its 1-bit decision if that decision exceeds a pre-determined detection accuracy threshold, and sends out all its observations otherwise. This scheme provides WSN designers the flexibility to balance detection accuracy, sensor density, and energy consumption. We develop the optimal decision rules for this scheme. We also propose methods to calculate the detection accuracy threshold for individual sensor node to guarantee the overall detection accuracy at the fusion center. The simulation results show that the hybrid scheme consumes significantly less energy than both centralized and distributed schemes to achieve the same detection accuracy

Secure code distribution in dynamically programmable wireless sensor networks

None
2006
Remote reprogramming of in situ wireless sensor networks (WSNs) via the wireless link is an important capability. Securing the process of reprogramming allows each sensor node to authenticate each received code image. Due to the resource constraints of WSNs, public key schemes must be used sparingly. This paper introduces a mechanism for secure and efficient code distribution that employs public key cryptography only to sign the root of a combined structure consisting of both hash chains and hash trees. The chain based scheme works best when packets are received in the order they are sent with very few losses. Our hash tree based scheme allows nodes to authenticate packets and verify their integrity quickly, even when the packets may arrive out of order, but can result in too many public key operations. Integrating hash chains and hash trees produces a mechanism that is both resilient to losses and lightweight in terms of reducing memory consumption and the number of public key operations that a node has to perform. Simulation shows that the proposed secure reprogramming schemes add only a modest amount of overhead to a conventional non-secure reprogramming scheme, namely Deluge, and are therefore feasible and practical in a wireless sensor network

A linear programming approach to NLOS error mitigation in sensor networks
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
In this paper, we propose a linear programming approach to the problem of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) error mitigation in sensor networks. The locations of sensor nodes can be estimated using range or distance estimates from location-aware "anchor" nodes. In the absence of line-of-sight (LOS) between the sensor and anchor nodes, e.g., in indoor networks, the NLOS range estimates can be severely biased. If these biased range estimates are directly incorporated into practical location estimators such as the least-squares (LS) estimator without the mitigation of these bias errors, this can potentially lead to degradation in the accuracy of sensor location estimates. On the other hand, discarding the biased range estimates may not be a viable option, since the number of range estimates available may be limited. We present a novel NLOS bias mitigation scheme, based on linear programming, which (i) allows us to incorporate NLOS range information into sensor location-estimation, but (ii) does not allow NLOS bias errors to degrade sensor localization accuracy

Energy-efficient data representation and routing for wireless sensor networks based on a distributed wavelet compression algorithm
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
We address the problem of energy consumption reduction for wireless sensor networks, where each of the sensors has limited power and acquires data that should be transmitted to a central node. The final goal is to have a reconstructed version of the data measurements at the central node, with the sensors spending as little energy as possible, for a given data reconstruction accuracy. In our scenario, sensors in the network have a choice of different coding schemes to achieve varying levels of compression. The compression algorithms considered are based on the lifting factorization of the wavelet transform, and exploit the natural data flow in the network to aggregate data by computing partial wavelet coefficients that are refined as data flows towards the central node. The proposed algorithm operates by first selecting a routing strategy through the network. Then, for each route, an optimal combination of data representation algorithms i.e. assignment at each node, is selected. A simple heuristic is used to determine the data representation technique to use once path merges are taken into consideration. We demonstrate that by optimizing the coding algorithm selection the overall energy consumption can be significantly reduced when compared to the case when data is just quantized and forwarded to the central node. Moreover, the proposed algorithm provides a tool to compare different routing techniques and identify those that are most efficient overall, for given node locations. We evaluate the algorithm using both a second-order autoregressive (AR) model and empirical data from a real wireless sensor network deployment

Securing the Deluge network programming system

None
2006
A number of multi-hop, wireless, network programming systems have emerged for sensor network retasking but none of these systems support a cryptographically-strong, public-key-based system for source authentication and integrity verification. The traditional technique for authenticating a program binary, namely a digital signature of the program hash, is poorly suited to resource-contrained sensor nodes. Our solution to the secure programming problem leverages authenticated streams, is consistent with the limited resources of a typical sensor node, and can be used to secure existing network programming systems. Under our scheme, a program binary consists of several code and data segments that are mapped to a series of messages for transmission over the network. An advertisement, consisting of the program name, version number, and a hash of the very first message, is digitally signed and transmitted first. The advertisement authenticates the first message, which in turn contains a hash of the second message. Similarly, the second message contains a hash of the third message, and so on, binding each message to the one logically preceding it in the series through the hash chain. We augmented the Deluge network programming system with our protocol and evaluated the resulting system performance

The hardware platform utilized is MicroStrain's V-Link wireless sensors along with a MicroStrain USB base station, configured for operation in the 902-928 MHz frequency band. The key contributions of the work are twofold. First, the developed strategies are computationally simple and thus can be implemented on existing node microcontrollers. Second, the fading measurement methodology utilizes the sensor nodes themselves to effectively provide distributed scalar, network analyzer functionality.

Tapper: a lightweight scripting engine for highly constrained wireless sensor nodes

Tapper is a lightweight scripting engine for highly constrained wireless sensor nodes. Many such nodes run on 8-bit microcontrollers (MCUs) with only a few kilobytes of on-chip memory, often with segmented memory and unorthogonal registers that make it difficult to perform even the most basic tasks. To facilitate development of software routines and enable dynamic reconfigurability, Tapper provides a software layer that can interpret human readable commands either interactively or in batch. It can invoke compiled routines ranging from timer and interrupt configurations and task scheduling to accessing I/O devices. Experiments on platforms including 8051, ATMega 169V, and Freescale MC9S12NE64 with built-in Ethernet show that the Tapper setup has the same modular, dynamic benefits as middleware systems but without the high overhead in code size and data memory

Tinker lets users write simple programs, as if they were manipulating individual scalar values, and simulates those computations over continuous streams of sensor data. Tinker does not require (or allow) users to specify details such as routing algorithms or retransmission policies, freeing system designers to rapidly iterate among different broad designs before fleshing out details of the one that looks most promising.

Ultra-low power data storage for sensor networks

Local storage is required in many sensor network applications, both for archival of detailed event information, as well as to overcome sensor platform memory constraints. While extensive measurement studies have been performed to highlight the trade-off between computation and communication in sensor networks, the role of storage has received little attention. The storage subsystems on currently available sensor platforms have not exploited technology trends, and consequently the energy cost of storage on these platforms is as high as that of communication. Current flash memories, however, offer a low-priced, high-capacity and extremely energy-efficient storage solution. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of the active and sleep-mode energy consumption of available flash-based storage options for sensor platforms. Our results demonstrate more than a 100-fold decrease in per-byte energy consumption for surface-mount parallel NAND flash in comparison with the MicaZ on-board serial flash. In addition, this dramatically reduces storage energy costs relative to communication, introducing a new dimension in traditional computation vs communication trade-offs. Our results have significant ramifications on the design of sensor platforms as well as on the energy consumption of sensing applications. We quantify the potential energy gains for two commonly used sensor network services: communication and in-network data aggregation. Our measurements show significant improvements in each service: 50-fold and up to 10-fold reductions in energy for communication and data aggregation respectively

Summary form only given. Scientists from 16 countries are building the largest ever Observatory for the Highest Energy Cosmic Particles. In the Argentina pampas, 1,600 water Cherenkov detectors will cover an area of 3,000 square kilometers overlooked by four fluorescence telescopes. The Cherenkov detectors are placed in a 1.5-kilometer triangular grid, powered by solar panels, timed by GPS's, and communicating via radio antennas. At the highest energies, one cosmic ray particle generates a shower that triggers dozens of detectors within microseconds as the shower reaches the ground. In dark moonless nights, the fluorescence telescopes observe the same showers through the ultraviolet emission of nitrogen molecules in the air excited by shower particles. The fluorescence telescopes are sensitive to the faint UV emission from tens of miles away. Together, the fluorescence telescopes and ground Cherenkov detectors form the most powerful observatory to ever study the highest energy cosmic ray showers. The goal of the Pierre Auger Observatory is to unveil the mysterious origin of particles with energies a billion times larger than present terrestrial accelerators can reach. During deployment, the Observatory has already produced intriguing results during construction. We will discuss the astrophysical and physical challenges of unveiling this high-energy mystery

Sdlib: a sensor network data and communications library for rapid and robust application development

2006
Sensor network applications tend to exhibit significant high-level commonalities along several major dimensions that have heretofore been underexposed, particularly in the areas of collection and dissemination. We have developed a component library, Sdlib, which presents the fundamental abstractions of collection and dissemination as part of a dataflow system. This allows application developers to rapidly develop applications at the nesC level. This means that Sdlib maintains significant expressivity while operating efficiently. We have built four applications, each faithful to a mature monolithic application, on top of Sdlib to compare its performance to that of original. We find that applications implemented with Sdlib are much simpler to write, just as resource efficient, and perform comparably to monolithic implementations

Node-density independent localization
2006 5th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2006
This paper presents an enhanced version of a novel radio interferometric positioning technique for node localization in wireless sensor networks that provides both high accuracy and long range simultaneously. The ranging method utilizes two transmitters emitting radio signals at almost the same frequencies. The relative location is estimated by measuring the relative phase offset of the generated interference signal at two receivers. Here, we analyze how the selection of carrier frequencies affects the precision and maximum range. Furthermore, we describe how the interplay of RF multi-path and ground reflections degrades the ranging accuracy. To address these problems, we introduce a technique that continuously refines the range estimates as it converges to the localization solution. Finally, we present the results of a field experiment where our prototype achieved 4 cm average localization accuracy for a quasi-random deployment of 16 COTS motes covering the area of two football fields. The maximum range measured was 170 m, four times the observed communication range. Consequently, node deployment density is no longer constrained by the localization technique, but rather by the communication range

The low power energy aware processing (LEAP) embedded networked sensor system

A broad range of embedded networked sensor (ENS) systems for critical environmental monitoring applications now require complex, high peak power dissipating sensor devices, as well as on-demand high performance computing and high bandwidth communication. Embedded computing demands for these new platforms include support for computationally intensive image and signal processing as well as optimization and statistical computing. To meet these new requirements while maintaining critical support for low energy operation, a new multiprocessor node hardware and software architecture, low power energy aware processing (LEAP), has been developed. The LEAP architecture integrates fine-grained energy dissipation monitoring and sophisticated power control scheduling for all subsystems including sensor subsystems. This paper also describes a new distributed node testbed demonstrating that by exploiting high high energy efficiency components and enabling proper on-demand scheduling, the LEAP architecture may meet both sensing performance and energy dissipation objectives for a broad class of applications

Address-event imagers for sensor networks: evaluation and modeling

2006
Although imaging is an information-rich sensing modality, the use of cameras in sensor networks is very often prohibited by factors such as power, computation cost, storage, communication bandwidth and privacy. In this paper we consider information selective and privacy-preserving address-event imagers for sensor networks. Instead of providing full images with a high degree of redundancy, our efforts in the design of these imagers specialize on selecting a handful of features from a scene and outputting these features in address-event representation. In this paper we present our initial results in modeling and evaluating address-event sensors in the context of sensor networks. Using three different platforms that we have developed, we illustrate how to model address-event cameras and how to build an emulator using these models. We also present a lightweight classification scheme to illustrate the computational advantages of address-event sensors. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the classification algorithm and a feasibility study of using COTS components to emulate address-event inside a sensor network

Towards radar-enabled sensor networks

2006
Ultra wideband radar-enabled wireless sensor networks have the potential to address key detection and classification requirements common to many surveillance and tracking applications. However, traditional radar signal processing techniques are mismatched with the limited computational and storage resources available on typical sensor nodes. The mismatch is exacerbated in noisy, cluttered environments or when the signals have corrupted spectra. To explore the compatibility of ultra wideband radar and mote-class sensor nodes, we designed and built a new platform called the radar mote. An early prototype of this platform was used to detect, classify, and track people and vehicles moving through an outdoor sensor network deployment. This paper describes the sensor's theory of operation, discusses the design and implementation of the radar mote, and presents sample signal waveforms of people, vehicles, noise, and clutter. We demonstrate that radar sensors can be successfully integrated with mote-class devices and imbue them with an extraordinarily useful sensing modality

Structural damage detection and localization using NETSHM

Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an important application area for wireless sensor networks. SHM techniques attempt to autonomously detect and localize damage in large civil structures. Structural engineers often implement and test SHM algorithms in a higher level language such as C/Matlab. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of NETSHM, a sensor network system that allows structural engineers to program SHM applications in Mat-lab or C at a high level of abstraction. In particular, structural engineers do not have to understand the intricacies of wireless networking, or the details of sensor data acquisition. We have implemented a damage detection technique and a damage localization technique on a complete NETSHM prototype. Our experiments on small and medium-scale structures show that NETSHM is able to detect and localized damage perfectly with very few false-positives and no false negatives, and that it is robust even in realistic wireless environments

2006
Agriculture accounts for a significant portion of the GDP in most developed countries. However, managing farms, particularly large-scale extensive farming systems, is hindered by lack of data and increasing shortage of labour. We have deployed a large heterogeneous sensor network on a working farm to explore sensor network applications that can address some of the issues identified above. Our network is solar powered and has been running for over 6 months. The current deployment consists of over 40 moisture sensors that provide soil moisture profiles at varying depths, weight sensors to compute the amount of food and water consumed by animals, electronic tag readers, up to 40 sensors that can be used to track animal movement (consisting of GPS, compass and accelerometers), and 20 sensor/actuators that can be used to apply different stimuli (audio, vibration and mild electric shock) to the animal. The static part of the network is designed for 24/7 operation and is linked to the Internet via a dedicated high-gain radio link, also solar powered. The initial goals of the deployment are to provide a testbed for sensor network research in programmability and data handling while also being a vital tool for scientists to study animal behavior. Our longer term aim is to create a management system that completely transforms the way farms are managed

The Worst-Case Capacity of Wireless Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
The key application scenario of wireless sensor networks is data gathering: sensor nodes transmit data, possibly in a multi-hop fashion, to an information sink. The performance of sensor networks is thus characterized by the rate at which information can be aggregated to the sink. In this paper, we derive the first scaling laws describing the achievable rate in worst-case, i.e. arbitrarily deployed, sensor networks. We show that in the physical model of wireless communication and for a large number of practically important functions, a sustainable rate of Theta(1/log2 n) can be achieved in every network, even when nodes are positioned in a worst-case manner. In contrast, we show that the best possible rate in the protocol model is Theta(1/n), which establishes an exponential gap between these two standard models of wireless communication. Furthermore, our worst-case capacity result almost matches the rate of Theta(1/log n) that can be achieved in randomly deployed networks. The high rate is made possible by employing non-linear power assignment at nodes and by exploiting SINR-effects. Finally, our algorithm also improves the best known bounds on the scheduling complexity in wireless networks.

DESYNC: Self-Organizing Desynchronization and TDMA on Wireless Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Desynchronization is a novel primitive for sensor networks: it implies that nodes perfectly interleave periodic events to occur in a round-robin schedule. This primitive can be used to evenly distribute sampling burden in a group of nodes, schedule sleep cycles, or organize a collision-free TDMA schedule for transmitting wireless messages. Here we present Desync, a biologically-inspired self-maintaining algorithm for desynchronization in a single-hop network. We present (1) theoretical results showing convergence, (2) experimental results on TinyOS-based Telos sensor motes, and (3) a DESYNC-based TDMA protocol. Desync-TDMA addresses two weaknesses of traditional TDMA: it does not require a global clock and it automatically adjusts to the number of participating nodes, so that bandwidth is always fully utilized. Experimental results show a reduction in message loss under high contention from approximately 58% to less than 1%, as well as a 25% increase in throughput over the default Telos MAC protocol.

Improving Wireless Simulation Through Noise Modeling

We propose modeling environmental noise in order to efficiently and accurately simulate wireless packet delivery. We measure noise traces in many different environments and propose three algorithms to simulate noise from these traces. We evaluate applying these algorithms to signal-to-noise curves in comparison to existing simulation approaches used in EmStar, TOSSIM, and ns2. We measure simulation accuracy using the Kantorovich-Wasserstein distance on conditional packet delivery functions. We demonstrate that using a closest-fit pattern matching (CPM) noise model can capture complex temporal dynamics which existing approaches do not, increasing packet simulation fidelity by a factor of 2 for good links, a factor of 1.5 for bad links, and a factor of 5 for intermediate links. As our models are derived from real-world traces, they can be generated for many different environments.

A Control Theory Approach to Throughput Optimization in Multi-Channel Collection Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Most currently deployed sensor networks use the same channel to communicate information among nodes. This is a source of great inefficiency as it poorly utilizes the available wireless spectrum. This paper takes advantage of radio capabilities of MicaZ motes that can communicate on multiple frequencies as specified in the 802.15.4 standard. We consider the case of a data collection sensor network where multiple base-stations are responsible for draining data from sensor nodes. A key question becomes how to assign nodes to wireless channels such that network throughput is maximized. The problem is reduced to one of load balancing. A control theoretical approach is used to design a self-regulating load-balancing algorithm that maximizes total network throughput. It is evaluated both in simulation and on an experimental testbed. The results demonstrate a significant performance improvement. It is shown that a control theory approach is indeed needed to guarantee stability in data collection networks and prevent undue oscillation of nodes among different wireless channels upon dynamic changes in load conditions.

An Empirical Study of Collaborative Acoustic Source Localization

2007
Field biologists use animal sounds to discover the presence of individuals and to study their behavior. Collecting bio- acoustic data has traditionally been a difficult and time- consuming process in which researchers use portable microphones to record sounds while taking notes of their own detailed observations. The recent development of new deploy- able acoustic sensor platforms presents opportunities to develop automated tools for bio-acoustic field research. In this work, we implement an AML-based source localization algorithm, and use it to localize marmot alarm-calls. We assess the performance of these techniques based on results from two field experiments: (1) a controlled test of direction-of- arrival (DOA) accuracy using a pre-recorded source signal, and (2) an experiment to detect and localize actual animals in their habitat, with a comparison to ground truth gathered from human observations. Although small arrays yield ambiguities from spatial aliasing of high frequency signals, we show that these ambiguities are readily eliminated by proper bearing crossings of the DOAs from several arrays. These results show that the AML source localization algorithm can be used to localize actual animals in their natural habitat, using a platform that is practical to deploy.

Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks

2007
A fundamental problem in wireless sensor networks is localization - the determination of the geographical locations of sensors. Most existing localization algorithms were designed to work well either in networks of static sensors or networks in which all sensors are mobile. In this paper, we propose two localization algorithms, MSL and MSL*, that work well when any number of sensors are static or mobile. MSL and MSL* are range-free algorithms - they do not require that sensors are equipped with hardware to measure signal strengths, angles of arrival of signals or distances to other sensors. We present simulation results to demonstrate that MSL and MSL* outperform existing algorithms in terms of localization error in very different mobility conditions. MSL* outperforms MSL in most scenarios, but incurs a higher communication cost. MSL outperforms MSL* when there is significant irregularity in the radio range. We also point out some problems with a well known lower bound for the error in any range-free localization algorithm in static sensor networks.

Robust System Multiangulation Using Subspace Methods

2007
Sensor location information is a prerequisite to the utility of most sensor networks. In this paper we present a robust and low-complexity algorithm to self-localize and orient sensors in a network based on angle-of-arrival (AOA) information. The proposed non-iterative subspace-based method is robust to missing and noisy measurements and works for cases when sensor orientations are either known or unknown. We show that the computational complexity of the algorithm is O(mn2), where m is the number of measurements and n is the total number of sensors. Simulation results demonstrate that the error of the proposed subspace algorithm is only marginally greater than an iterative maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), while the computational complexity is two orders of magnitude less. Additionally, the iterative MLE is prone to converge to local maxima in the likelihood function without accurate initialization. We illustrate that the proposed subspace method can be used to initialize the MLE and obtain near-Cramer-Rao performance for sensor localization. Finally, the scalability of the subspace algorithm is illustrated by demonstrating how clusters within a large network may be individually localized and then merged.

Environment monitoring in coal mines is an important application of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that has commercial potential. We discuss the design of a structure-aware self-adaptive WSN system, SASA. By regulating the mesh sensor network deployment and formulating a collaborative mechanism based on a regular beacon strategy, SASA is able to rapidly detect structure variations caused by underground collapses. A prototype is deployed with 27 Mica2 motes. We present our implementation experiences as well as the experimental results. To better evaluate the scalability and reliability of SASA, we also conduct a large-scale trace-driven simulation based on real data collected from the experiments.

Differential Nested Lattice Encoding for Consensus Problems
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
In this paper we consider the problem of transmitting quantized data while performing an average consensus algorithm. Average consensus algorithms are protocols to compute the average value of all sensor measurements via near neighbors communications. The main motivation for our work is the observation that consensus algorithms offer the perfect example of network communications where there is an increasing correlation between the data exchanged, as the system updates its computations. Henceforth, it is possible to utilize previously exchanged data and current side information to reduce significantly the demands of quantization bit rate for a certain precision. We analyze the case of a network with a topology built as that of a random geometric graph and with links that are assumed to be reliable at a constant bit rate. Numerically we show that in consensus algorithms, increasing number of iterations does not have the effect of increasing the error variance. Thus, we conclude that noisy recursions lead to a consensus if the data correlation is exploited in the messages source encoders and decoders. We briefly state the theoretical results which are parallel to our numerical experiments.

Distributed Consensus and Linear Functional Calculation in Networks: An Observability Perspective
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
We study the problem of performing sensor fusion and distributed consensus in networks, where the objective is to calculate some linear function of the initial sensor values at some or all of the sensors. We utilize a linear iteration where, at each time-step, each sensor updates its value to be a weighted average of its own previous value and those of its neighbors. We show that this approach can be viewed as a linear dynamical system, with dynamics that are given by the weight matrix for the linear iteration, and with outputs for each sensor that are captured by the subset of the state vector that is measurable by that sensor. We then cast the fusion and consensus problems as that of observing a linear functional of the initial state vector using only local measurements (that are available at each sensor). When the topology of the network is time-invariant, we show that the weight matrix can be chosen so that each sensor can calculate the desired function as a linear combination of its measurements over a finite number of time-steps.

Robust Message-Passing for Statistical Inference in Sensor Networks

Large-scale sensor network applications require in-network processing and data fusion to compute statistically relevant summaries of the sensed measurements. This paper studies distributed message-passing algorithms, in which neighboring nodes in the network pass local information relevant to a global computation, for performing statistical inference. We focus on the class of reweighted belief propagation (RBP) algorithms, which includes as special cases the standard sum-product and max-product algorithms for general networks with cycles, but in contrast to standard algorithms has attractive theoretical properties (uniqueness of fixed points, convergence, and robustness). Our main contribution is to design and implement a practical and modular architecture for implementing RBP algorithms in real networks. In addition, we show how intelligent scheduling of RBP messages can be used to minimize communication between motes and prolong the lifetime of the network. Our simulation and Mica2 mote deployment indicate that the proposed algorithms achieve accurate results despite real- world problems such as dying motes, dead and asymmetric links, and dropped messages. Overall, the class of RBP provides an ideal fit for sensor networks due to their distributed nature, requiring only local knowledge and coordination, and little requirements on other services such as reliable transmission.

A Platform for Ubiquitous Sensor Deployment in Occupational and Domestic Environments
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2007
In this paper, we introduce the "Plug" sensor network, a ubiquitous networked sensing platform ideally suited to broad deployment in environments where people work and live. The backbone of the Plug sensor network is a set of 35 sensor-, radio-, and computation-enabled power strips distributed throughout the third floor of the MIT Media Lab. A single Plug device fulfills all the functional requirements of a normal power strip (i.e., four 120 V, 60 Hz electrical outlets; surge protector circuit; standard electrical connector to a US-style wall socket), and can be used without special training. Additionally, each Plug has a wide range of sensing modalities (e.g., sound, light, electrical current and voltage, vibration, motion, and temperature) for gathering data about how it is being used and its nearby environment. To our knowledge, the Plug sensor network is the first to embody the idea of designing sensor nodes to seamlessly become a part of their environment, rather than play the role of alien, if unobtrusive, observers. We argue this design principle is essential for sensor networks to succeed in the realm of ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we present an overview of the Plug hardware and software architectures, look at specific usage scenarios of a single Plug, and show example data taken across the entire Plug network to give a sense of the pulse of the building over a span of days. Finally, we present ongoing work interfacing heterogeneous devices with the Plug network for a variety of applications and discuss possible future work.

mPlatform: A Reconfigurable Architecture and Efficient Data Sharing Mechanism for Modular Sensor Nodes
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2007
We present mPlatform, a new reconfigurable modular sensornet platform that enables real-time processing on multiple heterogeneous processors. At the heart of the mPlatform is a scalable high- performance communication bus connecting the different modules of a node, allowing time-critical data to be shared without delay and supporting reconfigurability at the hardware level. Furthermore, the bus allows components of an application to span across different processors/modules without incurring much overhead, thus easing the program development and supporting software reconfigurability. We describe the communication architecture, protocol, and hardware configuration, and the implementation in a low power, high speed complex programmable logic device (CPLD). An asynchronous interface decouples the local processor of each module from the bus, allowing the bus to operate at the maximum desired speed while letting the processors focus on their real time tasks such as data collection and processing. Extensive experiments on the mPlatform prototype have validated the scalability of the communication architecture, and the high speed, reconfigurable intermodule communication that is achieved at the expense of a small increase in the power consumption. Finally, we demonstrate a realtime sound source localization application on the mPlatform, with four channels of acoustic data acquisition, FFT, and sound classification, that otherwise would be infeasible using traditional buses such as I2C.

A Higher Capability Sensor Node Platform Suitable for Demanding Applications
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
A novel, autonomous, fully distributed sensor node platform designed and built for a continuous, wide-area surveillance and security system is described. Sensor nodes cooperate to detect and track intruders in the surveilled area. Analysis and simulation of the surveillance system indicates that while considerably more capability is required in many aspects (processing power, memory, latency, communication range, and so on) than is currently available in common "mote" designs, performance, energy consumption, node lifetime, and ease of use are enhanced by this approach. Because higher capability components are used, more careful scheduling and power control software is required to mitigate the impact on energy consumption. A full software suite was developed and instrumented to record true system usage during operation of the surveillance system. Measurements of actual usage have been made on a moderately oversized prototype platform. A second generation platform has been designed based on the measured usage data. The software suite is being ported to this platform. Lifetime of the second generation platform running the demanding surveillance application is expected to be about 90 days on 2 AA batteries (3000mAh at 1.5V). Applications with less stringent requirements should enjoy much longer lifetimes.

This paper presents the design principles, implementation, and evaluation of the RETOS operating system which is specifically developed for micro sensor nodes. RETOS has four distinct objectives, which are to provide (1) a multithreaded programming interface, (2) system resiliency, (3) kernel extensibility with dynamic reconfiguration, and (4) WSN-oriented network abstraction. RETOS is a multithreaded operating system, hence it provides the commonly used thread model of programming interface to developers. We have used various implementation techniques to optimize the performance and resource usage of multithreading. RETOS also provides software solutions to separate kernel from user applications, and supports their robust execution on MMU-less hardware. The RETOS kernel can be dynamically reconfigured, via loadable kernel framework, so a application- optimized and resource-efficient kernel is constructed. Finally, the networking architecture in RETOS is designed with a layering concept to provide WSN-specific network abstraction. RETOS currently supports Atmel ATmegal28, TI MSP430, and Chipcon CC2430 family of microcontrollers. Several real-world WSN applications are developed for RETOS and the overall evaluation of the systems is described in the paper.

Interface Contracts for TinyOS

2007
TinyOS applications are built with software components that communicate through narrow interfaces. Since components enable finegrained code reuse, this approach has been successful in creating applications that make very efficient use of the limited code and data memory on sensor network nodes. However, the other important benefit of components-rapid application development through black-box reuse-remains largely unrealized because in many cases interfaces have implied usage constraints that can be the source of frustrating program errors. Developers are commonly forced to read the source code for components, partially defeating the purpose of using components in the first place. Our research helps solve these problems by allowing developers to explicitly specify and enforce component interface contracts. Due to the extensive reuse of the most common interfaces, implementing contracts for a small number of frequently reused interfaces permitted us to extensively check a number of applications. We uncovered some subtle and previously unknown bugs in applications that have been in common use for years.

Beacon Location Service: A Location Service for Point-to-Point Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
In this paper we present Beacon Location Service (BLS): a location service for beacon-based routing algorithms like Beacon Vector Routing (BVR) [8] and S4 [19]. The role of a location service is to map node names to topologically meaningful addresses that can be used for routing. We evaluate an implementation of BLS that works on top of BVR. BLS resolves the destination node's name to BVR coordinates and then uses BVR to route the source message to the destination node. Together, BVR with BLS offer a complete solution for scalable point-to-point routing in sensornets. We describe our design and its implementation and evaluate BLS in simulation and on a sensornet testbed. Our results show it can sustain a high look-up and routing success rate (greater than 90% on most network sizes we tested) over various send rates and network sizes. We also compare our results to two existing point-to-point routing schemes for sensornets, and show that BLS+BVR performs comparably to state of the art point-to-point routing protocols. Finally, we demonstrate a simplified distributed hash table application implemented over BLS.

Worldsens: Development and Prototyping Tools for Application Specific Wireless Sensors Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2007
In this paper we present Worldsens, an integrated environment for development and rapid prototyping of wireless sensor network applications. Our environment relies on software simulation to help the designer during the whole development process. The refinement is done starting from the high level design choices down to the target code implementation, debug and performance analysis. In the early stages of the design, high level parameters, like for example the node sleep and activity periods, can be tuned using WS- Net, an event driven wireless network simulator. WSNet uses models for applications, protocols and radio medium communication with a parameterized accuracy. The second step of the sensor network application design takes place after the hardware implementation choices. This second step relies on the WSim cycle accurate hardware platform simulator. WSim is used to debug the application using the real target binary code. Precise performance evaluation, including real-time analysis at the interrupt level, are made possible at this low simulation level. WSim can be connected to WSNet, in place of the application and protocol models used during the high level simulation to achieve a full distributed application simulation. WSNet and WSNet+WSim allow a continuous refinement from high level estimations down to low level real-time validation. We illustrate the complete application design process using a real life demonstrator that implements a hello protocol for dynamic neighborhood discovery in a wireless sensor network environment.

We present SPOT, a scalable power observation tool that enables in situ measurement of nodal power and energy over a dynamic range exceeding four decades or a temporal resolution of microseconds. Using SPOT, every node in a sensor network can now be instrumented, providing unparalleled visibility into the dynamic power profile of applications and system software. Power metering at every node enables previously impossible empirical evaluation of low power designs at scale. The SPOT architecture and design meet challenges unique to wireless sensor networks and other low power systems, such as orders of magnitude difference in current draws between sleep and active states, short-duration power spikes during periods of brief activity, and the need for minimum perturbation of the system under observation.

SenQ: A Scalable Simulation and Emulation Environment for Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2007
Although there is growing interest in the use of physical testbeds to evaluate the performance of applications and protocols for sensor platforms, such studies also encounter significant challenges that include the lack of scalability and repeatability, as well as the inability to represent a diverse set of operational scenarios. On the other hand, simulators can typically address the preceding problems but often lack the high degree of fidelity available to the analysts with physical testbeds. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of SenQ - an accurate and scalable evaluation framework for sensor networks that effectively addresses the preceding challenges. In particular, SenQ integrates sensor network operating systems with a very high- fidelity simulation of wireless networks such that sensor network applications and protocols can be executed, without modifications, in a repeatable manner under a diverse set of scalable environments. SenQ extends beyond the existing suite of simulators and emulators in four key aspects: first, it supports emulation of sensor network applications and protocols in an efficient and flexible manner; second, it provides an efficient set of models of diverse sensing phenomena; third, it provides accurate models of both battery power and clock drift effect which have been shown to have a significant impact on sensor network studies; and finally it provides an efficient kernel that allows it to run experiments that provide substantial scalability in both the spatial and temporal contexts.

The Design and Evaluation of a Mobile Sensor/Actuator Network for Autonomous Animal Control
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
This paper investigates a mobile, wireless sensor/actuator network application for use in the cattle breeding industry. Our goal is to prevent fighting between bulls in on-farm breeding paddocks by autonomously applying appropriate stimuli when one bull approaches another bull. This is an important application because fighting between high-value animals such as bulls during breeding seasons causes significant financial loss to producers. Furthermore, there are significant challenges in this type of application because it requires dynamic animal state estimation, real-time actuation and efficient mobile wireless transmissions. We designed and implemented an animal state estimation algorithm based on a state-machine mechanism for each animal. Autonomous actuation is performed based on the estimated states of an animal relative to other animals. A simple, yet effective, wireless communication model has been proposed and implemented to achieve high delivery rates in mobile environments. We evaluated the performance of our design by both simulations and field experiments, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our autonomous animal control system.

Energy-efficient image communication is one of the most important goals for a large class of current and future sensor network applications. This paper presents a quantitative comparison between the energy costs associated with 1) direct transmission of uncompressed images and 2) sensor platform-based JPEG compression followed by transmission of the compressed image data. JPEG compression computations are mapped onto various resource-constrained sensor platforms using a design environment that allows computation using the minimum integer and fractional bit-widths needed in view of other approximations inherent in the compression process and choice of image quality parameters. Detailed experimental results examining the tradeoffs in processor resources, processing/transmission time, bandwidth utilization, image quality, and overall energy consumption are presented.

LaserSPECks: Laser SPECtroscopic Trace-Gas Sensor Networks - Sensor Integration and Applications
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
We introduce a novel laser spectroscopic trace-gas sensor platform, LaserSPECks that integrates recently developed miniature quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy (QE- PAS) gas sensing technology. This universal platform uses infrared laser spectroscopy detect and quantify numerous gas species at part-per-million to part-per-billion (ppm-ppb) concentrations (Curl, 2002). Traditional gas sensing devices capable of the same sensitivity and specificity are several orders of magnitude larger in size, cost, and power consumption. Thus, high resolution gas sensing technology has been difficult to integrate into small, low-power, replicated sensors suitable for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This paper presents the principles behind laser based trace gas detection, design issues, and outlines the implementation of a miniaturized trace-gas sensor from commerical-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. We report on an early prototype as a proof- of-concept for integration into WSN applications. We also describe a number of ongoing collaborations in utilizing the platform in air pollution and carbon flux quantification, industrial plant control, explosives detection, and medical diagnosis. Furthermore, we discuss experimental performance evaluations to examine general platform requirements for these types of sensors. The results of our evaluation illustrate that our prototype improves upon previous gas sensing technology by two orders of magnitude in measures of power consumption, size, and cost, without sacrificing sensor performance. Our design and experiments reveal that laser-based trace-gas sensors built from COTS can be successfully implemented and integrated within WSN nodes to enable a wide range of new and important sensing applications.

Exact Distributed Voronoi Cell Computation in Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Distributed computation of Voronoi cells in sensor networks, i.e. computing the locus of points in a sensor field closest to a given sensor, is a key building block that supports a number of applications in both the data and control planes. For example, knowledge of Voronoi cells facilitates efficient methods for computing the piece-wise approximation of a field, whereby each sensor acts as a representative for the set of points in its Voronoi cell; awareness of Voronoi boundaries and Voronoi neighbors is also useful in load balancing and energy conservation. The methods currently advocated for distributed Voronoi computation in sensor networks are heuristic approximations that can introduce significant inaccuracies that are difficult to rigorously quantify; we demonstrate that these methods may err by a factor of 5 or more in some circumstances. We present and prove an exact method which eliminates these inaccuracies, at the cost of increased messaging overhead, but without necessitating contact with the entire network. To our knowledge, this is the first distributed algorithm that computes accurate Voronoi cells without requiring all-to-all communication. We implement it as a TinyOS module and quantitatively analyze its performance.

Maximizing the Data Utility of a Data Archiving & Querying System through Joint Coding and Scheduling

2007
We study a joint scheduling and coding problem for collecting multi-snapshots spatial data in a resource constrained sensor network. Motivated by a distributed coding scheme for single snapshot data collection [7], we generalize the scenario to include multi-snapshots and general coding schemes. Associating a utility function with the recovered data, we aim to maximize the expected utility gain through joint coding and scheduling. We first assume non-mixed coding where coding is only allowed for data of the same snapshot. We study the problem of how to schedule (or prioritize) the codewords from multiple snapshots under an archiving model where data from all snapshots are of interests with additive utilities. We formalize the scheduling problem into a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. We derive the optimal solution using Git-tins Indices, and identify conditions under which a greedy algorithm is optimal. We then consider random mixed coding where data from different snapshots are randomly coded together. We generalize the growth codes in [7] to arbitrary linear-codes-based random mixed coding and show that there exists an optimal degree of coding. Various practical issues and the buffer size impact on performance are then discussed.

A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is designed, implemented, deployed and tested on the 4200 ft long main span and the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge (GGB). Ambient structural vibrations are reliably measured at a low cost and without interfering with the operation of the bridge. Requirements that SHM imposes on WSN are identified and new solutions to meet these requirements are proposed and implemented. In the GGB deployment, 64 nodes are distributed over the main span and the tower, collecting ambient vibrations synchronously at 1 kHz rate, with less than 10 mus jitter, and with an accuracy of 30 muG. The sampled data is collected reliably over a 46-hop network, with a bandwidth of 441 B/s at the 46th hop. The collected data agrees with theoretical models and previous studies of the bridge. The deployment is the largest WSN for SHM.

PIPENET: A Wireless Sensor Network for Pipeline Monitoring

US water utilities are faced with mounting operational and maintenance costs as a result of aging pipeline infrastructures. Leaks and ruptures in water supply pipelines and blockages and overflow events in sewer collectors cost millions of dollars a year, and monitoring and repairing this underground infrastructure presents a severe challenge. In this paper, we discuss how wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of operational data from pipeline infrastructures and thus address the challenge of near real-time monitoring and eventually control. We focus on the use of WSNs for monitoring large diameter bulk-water transmission pipelines. We outline a system, PipeNet, we have been developing for collecting hydraulic and acoustic/vibration data at high sampling rates as well as algorithms for analyzing this data to detect and locate leaks. Challenges include sampling at high data rates, maintaining aggressive duty cycles, and ensuring tightly time- synchronized data collection, all under a strict power budget. We have carried out an extensive field trial with Boston Water and Sewer Commission in order to evaluate some of the critical components of PipeNet. Along with the results of this preliminary trial, we describe the results of extensive laboratory experiments which are used to evaluate our analysis and data processing solutions. Our prototype deployment has led to the development of a reusable, field-reprogrammable software infrastructure for distributed high-rate signal processing in wireless sensor networks, which we also describe.

The Impact of Quasi-equally Spaced Sensor Layouts on Field Reconstruction
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
We consider wireless sensor networks whose nodes are randomly deployed and, thus, provide an irregular sampling of the sensed field. The field is assumed to be bandlimited; a sink node collects the data gathered by the sensors and reconstructs the field by using a technique based on linear filtering. By taking the mean square error (MSE) as performance metric, we evaluate the effect of quasi-equally spaced sensor layouts on the quality of the reconstructed signal. The MSE is derived through asymptotic analysis for different sensor spatial distributions, and for two of them we are able to obtain an approximate closed form expression. The case of uniformly distributed sensors is also considered for the sake of comparison. The validity of our asymptotic analysis is shown by comparison against numerical results and it is proven to hold even for a small number of nodes. Finally, with the help of a simple example, we show the key role that our results play in the deployment of sensor networks.

Hybrid Transition Density Approximation for Efficient Recursive Prediction of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
For several tasks in sensor networks, such as localization, information fusion, or sensor scheduling, Bayesian estimation is of paramount importance. Due to the limited computational and memory resources of the nodes in a sensor network, evaluation of the prediction step of the Bayesian estimator has to be performed very efficiently. An exact and closed-form representation of the predicted probability density function of the system state is typically impossible to obtain, since exactly solving the prediction step for nonlinear discrete-time dynamic systems in closed form is unfeasible. Assuming additive noise, we propose an accurate approximation of the predicted density, that can be calculated efficiently by optimally approximating the transition density using a hybrid density. A hybrid density consists of two different density types: Dirac delta functions that cover the domain of the current density of the system state, and another density type, e.g. Gaussian densities, that cover the domain of the predicted density. The freely selectable, second density type of the hybrid density depends strongly on the noise affecting the nonlinear system. So, the proposed approximation framework for nonlinear prediction is not restricted to a specific noise density. It further allows an analytical evaluation of the Chapman-Kolmogorov prediction equation and can be interpreted as a deterministic sampling estimation approach. In contrast to methods using random sampling like particle filters, a dramatic reduction in the number of components and a subsequent decrease in computation time for approximating the predicted density is gained.

Wireless Localization Using Self-Organizing Maps
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Localization is an essential service for many wireless sensor network applications. While several localization schemes rely on anchor nodes and range measurements to achieve fine-grained positioning, we propose a range-free, anchor- free solution that works using connectivity information only. The approach, suitable for deployments with strict cost constraints, is based on the neural network paradigm of self-organizing maps (SOM). We present a lightweight SOM- based algorithm to compute virtual coordinates that are effective for location-aided routing. This algorithm can also exploit the location information, if available, of few anchor nodes to compute absolute positions. Results of extensive simulations show improvements over the popular multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) scheme, especially for networks with low connectivity, which are intrinsically harder to localize, and in presence of irregular radio pattern or anisotropic deployment. We analytically demonstrate that the proposed scheme has low computation and communication overheads; hence, making it suitable for resource-constrained networks.

Energy-efficient Routing for Signal Detection under the Neyman-Pearson Criterion in Wireless Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Energy-efficient routing for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been a topic of great interest for the last few years, but thus far routing for signal detection in WSNs has not attracted much attention. In particular, little research has focused on the Neyman-Pearson criterion which is the most well accepted metric for radar, sonar and related signal detection problems. In this paper, we formulate the problem of energy-efficient routing for signal detection under the Neyman-Pearson criterion, apparently for the first time. We hereby propose two different routing metrics that aim at a tradeoff between the detection performance and the energy consumption. In particular, the first one leads to a combinatorial problem of identifying a path which achieves the largest possible mean detection-probability-to-energy ratio, while the second one reduces to finding a route which minimizes the consumed energy while maintaining a predetermined detection probability. We further provide efficient algorithms for solving these problems based on state-of-the-art research from operations research. We also present simulation results which indicate the distinctive energy-performance balance achieved by each proposed routing metric.

Energy-efficient Coverage for Target Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2007
In this paper we consider the coverage problem for target detection applications in wireless sensor networks. Unlike conventional coverage problems which assume sensing regions are disks around sensors, we define the sensing region according to detection constraints in terms of false alarm probability and missing probability. We show that exploiting cooperation between sensors can extend the overall sensing region while maintain the same constraints on false alarm probability and missing probability. We then propose an energy efficient cooperative detection scheme and study the trade-offs on energy consumption between cooperative and non-cooperative schemes. The cooperative scheme can use half the number of sensors to monitor the whole field compared to disk model in networks deployed on grids. We also study the communication overheads incurred by the cooperative scheme, and show that only cooperation between limited number of nearby sensors is profitable in terms of energy consumption. In our simulations on randomly deployed networks, cooperation reduces the number of sensors to cover the area by 30% and nearly doubles the number of disjoint sensor sets where each can fully cover the area. Appropriately trading off energy consumption with coverage extension, our cooperative detection scheme can increase the network lifetime by nearly 70%.

A Spatial Sampling Scheme Based on Innovations Diffusion in Sensor Networks

2007
This paper considers an estimation network of many distributed sensors with a certain correlation structure. Due to limited communication resources, the network selects only a subset of sensor measurements for estimation as long as the resulting fidelity is tolerable. We present a distributed sampling and estimation framework based on innovations diffusion, within which the sensor selection and estimation are accomplished through local computation and communications between sensor nodes. In order to achieve energy efficiency, the proposed algorithm uses a greedy heuristics to select a nearly minimum number of active sensors in order to ensure the desired fidelity for each estimation period. Extensive simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling scheme.

Distributed Sparse Random Projections for Refinable Approximation

Consider a large-scale wireless sensor network measuring compressible data, where n distributed data values can be well-approximated using only k &lt;g n coefficients of some known transform. We address the problem of recovering an approximation of the n data values by querying any L sensors, so that the reconstruction error is comparable to the optimal fc-term approximation. To solve this problem, we present a novel distributed algorithm based on sparse random projections, which requires no global coordination or knowledge. The key idea is that the sparsity of the random projections greatly reduces the communication cost of pre-processing the data. Our algorithm allows the collector to choose the number of sensors to query according to the desired approximation error. The reconstruction quality depends only on the number of sensors queried, enabling robust refinable approximation.

Harbor: Software-based Memory Protection For Sensor Nodes
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Many sensor nodes contain resource constrained microcontrollers where user level applications, operating system components, and device drivers share a single address space with no form of hardware memory protection. Programming errors in one application can easily corrupt the state of the operating system or other applications. In this paper, we propose Harbor, a memory protection system that prevents many forms of memory corruption. We use software based fault isolation ("sandboxing") to restrict application memory accesses and control flow to protection domains within the address space. A flexible and efficient memory map data structure records ownership and layout information for memory regions; writes are validated using the memory map. Control flow integrity is preserved by maintaining a safe stack that stores return addresses in a protected memory region. Run-time checks validate computed control flow instructions. Cross domain calls perform low-overhead control transfers between domains. Checks are introduced by rewriting an application's compiled binary. The sand- boxed result is verified on the sensor node before it is admitted for execution. Harbor's fault isolation properties depend only on the correctness of this verifier and the Harbor runtime. We have implemented and tested Harbor on the SOS operating system. Harbor detected and prevented memory corruption caused by programming errors in application modules that had been in use for several months. Harbor's overhead, though high, is less than that of application-specific virtual machines, and reasonable for typical sensor workloads.

Lucid Dreaming: Reliable Analog Event Detection for Energy-Constrained Applications

2007
Existing sensor network architectures are based on the assumption that data will be polled. Therefore, they are not adequate for long-term battery-powered use in applications that must sense or react to events that occur at unpredictable times. In response, and motivated by a structural autonomous crack monitoring (ACM) application from civil engineering that requires bursts of high resolution sampling in response to aperiodic vibrations in buildings and bridges, we have designed, implemented, and evaluated lucid dreaming, a hardware-software technique to dramatically decrease sensor node power consumption in this and other event- driven sensing applications. This work makes the following main contributions: (1) we have identified the key mismatches between existing, polling-based, sensor network architectures and event-driven applications; (2) we have proposed a hardware-software technique to permit the power-efficient use of sensor networks in event-driven applications; (3) we have analytically characterized the situations in which the proposed technique is appropriate; and (4) we have designed, implemented, and tested a hardware-software solution for standard Crossbow motes that embodies the proposed technique. In the building and bridge structural integrity monitoring application, the proposed technique achieves 1/245 the power consumption of existing sensor network architectures, thereby dramatically increasing battery lifespan or permitting operation based on energy scavenging.

MeshEye: A Hybrid-Resolution Smart Camera Mote for Applications in Distributed Intelligent Surveillance
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Surveillance is one of the promising applications to which smart camera motes forming a vision-enabled network can add increasing levels of intelligence. We see a high degree of in-node processing in combination with distributed reasoning algorithms as the key enablers for such intelligent surveillance systems. To put these systems into practice still requires a considerable amount of research ranging from mote architectures, pixel-processing algorithms, up to distributed reasoning engines. This paper introduces MeshEye, an energy-efficient smart camera mote architecture that has been designed with intelligent surveillance as the target application in mind. Special attention is given to MeshEye's unique vision system: a low-resolution stereo vision system continuously determines position, range, and size of moving objects entering its field of view. This information triggers a color camera module to acquire a high-resolution image sub-array containing the object, which can be efficiently processed in subsequent stages. It offers reduced complexity, response time, and power consumption over conventional solutions. Basic vision algorithms for object detection, acquisition, and tracking are described and illustrated on real- world data. The paper also presents a basic power model that estimates lifetime of our smart camera mote in battery-powered operation for intelligent surveillance event processing.

Design and Implementation of a Wireless Sensor Network for Intelligent Light Control
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
We present the design and implementation of the Illuminator, a preliminary sensor network-based intelligent light control system for entertainment and media production. Unlike most sensor network applications, which focus on sensing alone, a distinctive aspect of Illuminator is that it closes the loop from light sensing to lighting control. We describe the Illuminator's design requirements, system architecture, algorithms, implementation and experimental results. To satisfy the high-performance light sensing requirements of entertainment and media production applications, the system uses the Illumimote, which is a multi-modal and high fidelity light sensor module well-suited to wireless sensor networks. The Illuminator system is a toolset to characterize the illumination profile of a deployed set of fixed position lights, generate desired lighting effects for moving targets (actors, scenic elements, etc.) based on user constraints expressed in a formal language, and assist in the set up of lights to achieve the same illumination profile in multiple venues. After characterizing deployed lights, the Illuminator computes at run-time optimal light settings to achieve a user-specified actuation profile using an optimization framework based on a genetic algorithm Uniquely, it can use deployed sensors to incorporate changing ambient lighting conditions and moving targets into actuation. With experimental results, we demonstrate that the Illuminator handles various high-level user's constraints and generates optimal light actuation profile. These results suggest that our system should support entertainment and media production applications.

A Compact, High-Speed, Wearable Sensor Network for Biomotion Capture and Interactive Media
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
In this paper, we present a wireless sensor platform designed for processing multipoint human motion with low latency and high resolution. One application considered here is interactive dance, in which a choreographer wishes to translate the movements of multiple dancers into real-time audio or video content to accompany the performance. This can only be accomplished using a distributed measurement system capable of responding quickly with enough information to describe the expressive movements of multiple people. Similar requirements exist for biomechanical analysis, especially in the context of athletic training, where high resolution is demanded, and instant feedback is also desirable. Our approach to addressing such aggressive requirements involves a high-speed wireless network of compact inertial measurement units (IMUs) that can be worn at various locations on the body. Each device is equipped with its own 1 Mbps radio link and a full six-axis IMU, as well as a capacitive node-to-node proximity sensor. Currently, the system supports real-time data collection and processing for up to 25 nodes with 100 Hz full state updates, thereby handling much higher data rates than its predecessors. With locally buffered data, sample rates of up to 1 kHz have been achieved successfully. Early results discussed here demonstrate the feasibility of our design through testing with both dancers and professional athletes.

Active Sensing Platform for Wireless Structural Health Monitoring
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
This paper presents SHiMmer, a wireless platform for sensing and actuation that combines localized processing with energy harvesting to provide long-lived structural health monitoring. The life-cycle of the node is significantly extended by the use of super-capacitors for energy storage instead of batteries. During this period the node is expected to work completely maintenance-free. The node is capable of harvesting up to 780 J per day. This makes it completely self- sufficient while employed in real structural health monitoring applications. Unlike other sensor networks that periodically monitor a structure and route information to a base station, our device acquires the data and processes it locally after being radio-triggered by an external agent. The localized processing allows us to avoid issues due to network congestion. Our experiments show that its 32- bits computational core can run at 100 MIPS for 15 minutes daily.

Approximate Isocontours and Spatial Summaries for Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
We consider the problem of approximating a family of isocontours in a sensor field with a topologically-equivalent family of simple polygons. Our algorithm is simple and distributed, it gracefully adapts to any user-specified representation size k, and it delivers a worst-case guarantee for the quality of approximation. In particular, we prove that the topology-respecting Hausdorff error in our k-vertex approximation is within a small constant factor of the optimal error possible with Theta(k/log m) vertices, where m is the number of contours. Evaluation of the algorithm on real data suggests that the size increase factor in practice is a constant near 2.6, and shows no error increase. Our simulation results using a variety of synthetic and real data show that the algorithm smoothly handles complex isocontours, even for representation sizes as small as 32 or 48. Because isocontours are widely used to represent and communicate bi-variate signals, our technique is broadly applicable to in- network aggregation and summarization of spatial data in sensor networks.

FlashDB: Dynamic Self-tuning Database for NAND Flash
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
FlashDB is a self-tuning database optimized for sensor networks using NAND flash storage. In practical systems flash is used in different packages such as on-board flash chips, compact flash cards, secure digital cards and related formats. Our experiments reveal non-trivial differences in their access costs. Furthermore, databases may be subject to different types of workloads. We show that existing databases for flash are not optimized for all types of flash devices or for all workloads and their performance is thus subop- timal in many practical systems. FlashDB uses a novel self-tuning index that dynamically adapts its storage structure to workload and underlying storage device. We formalize the self-tuning nature of an index as a two-state task system and propose a 3-competitive online algorithm that achieves the theoretical optimum. We also provide a framework to determine the optimal size of an index node that minimizes energy and latency for a given device. Finally, we propose optimizations to further improve the performance of our index. We prototype and compare different indexing schemes on multiple flash devices and workloads, and show that our indexing scheme outperforms existing schemes under all workloads and flash devices we consider.

Hierarchical Spatial Gossip for Multi-Resolution Representations in Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
In this paper we propose a lightweight algorithm for constructing multi-resolution data representations for sensor networks. We compute, at each sensor node u, O(log n) aggregates about exponentially enlarging neighborhoods centered at u. The ith aggregate is the aggregated data among nodes approximately within 21 hops of u. We present a scheme, named the hierarchical spatial gossip algorithm, to extract and construct these aggregates, for all sensors simultaneously, with a total communication cost of 0(n polylog n). The hierarchical gossip algorithm adopts atomic communication steps with each node choosing to exchange information with a node distance d away with probability 1/d3. The attractiveness of the algorithm attributes to its simplicity, low communication cost, distributed nature and robustness to node failures and link failures. Besides the natural applications of multi-resolution data summaries in data validation and information mining, we also demonstrate the application of the pre-computed spatial multi-resolution data summaries in answering range queries efficiently.

Sparse Data Aggregation in Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
We study the problem of aggregating data from a sparse set of nodes in a wireless sensor network. This is a common situation when a sensor network is deployed to detect relatively rare events. In such situations, each node that should participate in the aggregation knows this fact based on its own sensor readings, but there is no global knowledge in the network of where all these interesting nodes are located. Instead of blindly querying all nodes in the network, we show how the interesting nodes can autonomously discover each other in a distributed fashion and form an ad hoc aggregation structure that can be used to compute cumulants, moments, or other statistical summaries. Key to our approach is the capability for two nodes that wish to communicate at roughly the same time to discover each other at a cost that is proportional to their network distance. We show how to build nearly optimal aggregation structures that can further deal with network volatility and compensate for the loss or duplication of data by exploiting probabilistic techniques.

Communicating via Fireflies: Geographic Routing on Duty-Cycled Sensors
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Geographic routing is a useful and scalable point-to-point communication primitive for wireless sensor networks. However, previous work on geographic routing makes the unrealistic assumption that all the nodes in the network are awake during routing. This overlooks the common deployment scenario where sensor nodes are duty-cycled to save energy. In this paper we investigate several important aspects of geographic routing over duty-cycled nodes. First, we extend existing geographic routing algorithms to handle the highly dynamic networks resulting from duty-cycling. Second, we provide the first formal analysis of the performance of geographic routing on duty-cycled nodes. Third, we use this analysis to develop an efficient decentralized sleep scheduling algorithm for reducing the number of awake nodes while maintaining both network coverage and a (tunable) target routing latency. Finally, we evaluate via simulation the performance of our approach versus running existing geographic routing algorithms on sensors duty-cycled according to previous sleep scheduling algorithms. Our results show, perhaps surprisingly, that a network of duty-cycled nodes can have slightly better routing performance than a static network that uses comparable energy. Our results further show that, compared to previous algorithms, our sleep scheduling algorithm significantly improves routing latency and network lifetime.

Dozer: Ultra-Low Power Data Gathering in Sensor Networks

2007
Environmental monitoring is one of the driving applications in the domain of sensor networks. The lifetime of such systems is envisioned to exceed several years. To achieve this longevity in unattended operation it is crucial to minimize energy consumption of the battery-powered sensor nodes. This paper proposes Dozer, a data gathering protocol meeting the requirements of periodic data collection and ultra-low power consumption. The protocol comprises MAC-layer, topology control, and routing all coordinated to reduce energy wastage of the communication subsystem. Using a tree-based network structure, packets are reliably routed towards the data sink. Parents thereby schedule precise rendezvous times for all communication with their children. In a deployed network consisting of 40 TinyOS- enabled sensor nodes, Dozer achieves radio duty cycles in the magnitude of 0.2%.

Link Layer Support for Unified Radio Power Management in Wireless Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Radio power management is of paramount concern in wireless sensor networks that must achieve long lifetimes on scarce amounts of energy. While a multitude of power management protocols have been proposed in the past, the lack of system support for flexibly integrating them with a diverse set of applications and network platforms has made them difficult to use. Instead of proposing yet another power management protocol, this paper focuses on providing link layer support towards realizing a unified power management architecture (UPMA) for flexible radio power management in wireless sensor networks. In contrast to the monolithic approaches adopted by existing power management solutions, we provide (1) a set of standard interfaces that allow different power management protocols existing at the link layer to be easily implemented on top of common MAC level functionality, (2) an architectural framework for enabling these protocols to be easily swapped in and out depending on the needs of the applications that require them, and (3) a mechanism for coordinating the existence of multiple applications, each of which may have different requirements for the same underlying power management protocol. We have implemented these features on the Mica2 and Telosb radio stacks in TinyOS-2.0. Microbenchmark results demonstrate that the separation of power management from MAC level functionality incurs a negligible decrease in performance when compared to existing monolithic implementations. Two case studies show that the power management requirements of multiple applications can be easily coordinated, sometimes even resulting in better power savings than any one of them can achieve individually.

Power Scheduling for Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
We previously presented a model for some wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN) applications based on the vector space tools of frame theory. In this WSAN model there is a weight associated to each sensor-actuator link denoting the importance of that communication link to the actuation fidelity. These weights were shown to be useful in pruning away communication links to reduce the number of active channels. Inspired by recent work in power scheduling for decentralized estimation, we investigate the optimal allocation of system resources for achieving a desired actuation fidelity. In this scheme, each sensor acquires a noisy observation and sends a message to a subset of actuators using an MQAM transmission strategy. The message sent on each sensor-actuator communication link is quantized with a variable number of bits, with the number of bits optimized to minimize the total network power consumption subject to a constraint on the actuation distortion. We show analytically and verify through simulation that performing this optimal power scheduling can yield significant power savings over communication strategies that use a fixed number of bits on each communication link.

MiniSec: A Secure Sensor Network Communication Architecture
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

Secure sensor network communication protocols need to provide three basic properties: data secrecy, authentication, and replay protection. Secure sensor network link layer protocols such as Tiny- Sec (C. Karlof et al., 2004) and ZigBee (2005) enjoy significant attention in the community. However, TinySec achieves low energy consumption by reducing the level of security provided. In contrast, ZigBee enjoys high security, but suffers from high energy consumption. MiniSec is a secure network layer that obtains the best of both worlds: low energy consumption and high security. MiniSec has two operating modes, one tailored for single-source communication, and another tailored for multi-source broadcast communication. The latter does not require per-sender state for replay protection and thus scales to large networks. We present a publicly available implementation of MiniSec for the Telos platform, and experimental results demonstrate our low energy utilization.

The Regiment Macroprogramming System
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
The development of high-level programming environments is essential if wireless sensor networks are to be accessible to nonexperts. In this paper, we present the Regiment system, which consists of a high-level language for spatiotemporal macroprogramming, along with a compiler that translates global programs into node-level code. In Regiment, the programmer views the network as a set of spatially-distributed data streams. The programmer can manipulate sets of these streams that may be defined by topological or geographic relationships between nodes. Regiment provides a rich set of primitives for processing data on individual streams, manipulating regions, performing aggregation over a region, and triggering new computation within the network. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Regiment language and compiler. We describe the deglobalization process that compiles a network-wide representation of the program into a node-level, event-driven program. Deglobalization maps region operations onto associated spanning trees that establish region membership and permit efficient in-network aggregation. We evaluate Regiment in the context of a complex distributed application involving rapid detection of spatially-distributed events, such as wildfires or chemical plumes. Our results show that Regiment makes it possible to develop complex sensor network applications at a global level.

Channel Surfing: Defending Wireless Sensor Networks from Interference
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Wireless sensor networks are susceptible to interference that can disrupt sensor communication. In order to cope with this disruption, we explore channel surfing, whereby the sensor nodes adapt their channel assignments to restore network connectivity in the presence of interference. We explore two different approaches to channel surfing: coordinated channel switching, where the entire sensor network adjusts its channel; and spectral multiplexing, where nodes in a jammed region switch channels while nodes on the boundary of a jammed region act as radio relays between different spectral zones. For spectral multiplexing, we have devised both synchronous and asynchronous strategies to facilitate the spectral scheduling needed to improve network fidelity when sensor nodes operate on multiple channels. In designing these algorithms, we have taken a system-oriented approach that has focused on exploring actual implementation issues under realistic network settings. We have implemented these proposed methods on a testbed of 30 Mica2 sensor nodes, and the experimental results show that these strategies can each repair network connectivity in the presence of interference without introducing significant overhead.

Object Tracking in the Presence of Occlusions via a Camera Network
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
This paper describes a sensor network approach to tracking a single object in the presence of static and moving occluders using a network of cameras. To conserve communication bandwidth and energy, each camera first performs simple local processing to reduce each frame to a scan line. This information is then sent to a cluster head to track a point object. We assume the locations of the static occluders to be known, but only prior statistics on the positions of the moving occluders are available. A noisy perspective camera measurement model is presented, where occlusions are captured through an occlusion indicator function. An auxiliary particle filter that incorporates the occluder information is used to track the object. Using simulations, we investigate (i) the dependency of the tracker performance on the accuracy of the moving occluder priors, (ii) the tradeoff between the number of cameras and the occluder prior accuracy required to achieve a prescribed tracker performance, and (iii) the importance of having occluder priors to the tracker performance as the number of occluders increases. We generally find that computing moving occluder priors may not be worthwhile, unless it can be obtained cheaply and to a reasonable accuracy. Preliminary experimental results are provided.

Probabilistic Detection of Mobile Targets in Heterogeneous Sensor Networks
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
Target detection and field surveillance are among the most prominent applications of sensor networks (SN). The quality of detection achieved by a SN can be quantified by evaluating the probability of detecting a mobile target crossing a field of interest (Fol). In this paper, we analytically evaluate the detection probability of mobile targets when N sensors are stochastically deployed to monitor a Fol. We map the target detection problem to a line-set intersection problem and derive analytical formulas using tools from integral geometry and geometric probability. We show that the detection probability depends on the length of the perimeters of the sensing areas of the sensors and not their shape. Hence, compared to prior work, our formulation allows us to consider a heterogeneous sensing model, where each sensor can have an arbitrary sensing area. We also evaluate the mean free path until a target is first detected.

Tracking Multiple Targets Using Binary Proximity Sensors

None
2007
Recent work has shown that, despite the minimal information provided by a binary proximity sensor, a network of such sensors can provide remarkably good target tracking performance. In this paper, we examine the performance of such a sensor network for tracking multiple targets. We begin with geometric arguments that address the problem of counting the number of distinct targets, given a snapshot of the sensor readings. We provide necessary and sufficient criteria for an accurate target count in a one-dimensional setting, and provide a greedy algorithm that determines the minimum number of targets that is consistent with the sensor readings. While these combinatorial arguments bring out the difficulty of target counting based on sensor readings at a given time, they leave open the possibility of accurate counting and tracking by exploiting the evolution of the sensor readings across time. To this end, we develop a particle filtering algorithm based on a cost function that penalizes changes in velocity. An extensive set of simulations, as well as experiments with passive infrared sensors, are reported. We conclude that, despite the combinatorial complexity of target counting, probabilistic approaches based on fairly generic models for the trajectories yield respectable tracking performance.

Detection, identification, and tracking (DIT) problems that arise in applications such as the protection of people and the environment against radiational, biological, and chemical plumes, can be solved by combining the modalities of sensor and cyber networks. The sensor network provides information about physical space activities, such as the locations and movements of plume sources and targets. The cyber network provides storage and computational resources to analyze and infer, based on realistic dispersion models of plumes with respect to physical phenomena (e.g., terrain and weather effects), where the plume originated, the trajectory of its movement (speed and direction), and the prediction of its future movement. The cyber network also makes decisions about where to task and activate plume sensors regarding their future sensing and communciation activities.

There are several interesting challenges in realizing such a system, such as providing efficient methods for the sensor nodes to make their data available to the network, allowing the sensor network applications to access the data from potentially disconnected and highly mobile devices, ensuring that privacy constraints are met, and allowing application developers to program the sensor network as required to build new applications.

Multimodal applications require the acquisition and processing of massive amounts of information from multiple sensors. Because this process is beyond the capabilities of a single machine, we developed a sensor network data transport system that can employ the numerous computing devices required to perform the task.

Multimodal applications require the acquisition and processing of massive amounts of information from multiple sensors. Because this process is beyond the capabilities of a single machine, we developed a sensor network data transport system that can employ the numerous computing devices required to perform the task. The computational and data acquisition processes are thus allocated to components spread across a network of systems. We present the NIST Smart Data Flow System II, which is a middleware layer that represents applications as data flow graphs, and transports information streams between the different computational components of the application.

SMILE - distributed middleware for event stream processing
2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2007
In this paper, we describe the SMILE (Smart Middleware, Light Ends) system which is one of the earliest systems built in the area of distributed event stream processing. SMILE unites the '"publish-subscribe" model of messaging middleware with the "continuous query" model of database systems. In SMILE, information producers, which may be sensors, applications, or databases, generate streams of events, such as RFID data, news items or stock trades; consumers specify stateful subscriptions to derived views, such as "individuals trading top 5 total volume of stock Y within x minutes before a major news story about the same company Y"; the SMILE system constructs and deploys a dataflow network of computations which process events from producers, compute derived views and deliver continuous and timely updates of subscribed views to consumers. Research challenges addressed by SMILE include: rigorously defining the semantics for correct state delivery; implementing this semantics in the presence of failure; distributing computations optimally over a network of multiple servers; scheduling and controlling message flow in this network; smoothly integrating this technology with other components, e.g., databases, services, user interfaces. SMILE is applicable to any "sense and respond" scenario that requires monitoring and processing of events as they are generated. Applications span multiple industries, e.g., monitoring financial opportunities and detecting potential fraud in financial industry, systems management and alerts in data centers, inventory management in RFID applications, and business performance management. In this paper, we describe the SMILE system, its architecture, services supported, and implementation details, and its use in multiple application scenarios.

A Group Tour Guide System with RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks

2007
This paper proposes a new application framework for group tour guiding services based on RFIDs and wireless sensor network. We consider a sensing field mixed with multiple independent tourist groups, each with a leader and several members. Members of a group will follow the moving path of their leader, but may occasionally roam around randomly based on their interest. Sensor nodes have to track leaders' locations and maintain following paths from members to leaders. A member may ask where his/her leader is, and a leader may "recall" his/her members. We propose a feasible solution to such an application by using existing technologies. A group guiding protocol is presented. The design enables reliable group guiding at low cost and low traffic load.

etop-Sensor Network Application Energy Profiling on the LEAP2 Platform

None
2007
A broad range of embedded networked sensor (ENS) systems for critical environmental monitoring applications now require complex, high peak power dissipating sensor devices, as well as on-demand high performance computing and high bandwidth communication. Embedded computing demands for these new platforms include support for computationally intensive image and signal processing as well as optimization and statistical computing. To meet these new requirements while maintaining critical support for low energy operation, a new multiprocessor node hardware and software architecture, low power energy aware Processing (LEAP), has been developed. The LEAP architecture integrates fine-grained energy dissipation monitoring and sophisticated power control scheduling for all subsystems including sensor subsystems. The LEAP2 platform is a second generation LEAP system with even higher resolution energy monitoring as well as the unique ability to do per process and per application energy profiling via a dedicated high performance ASIC. Our demonstration will highlight this profiling capability through a custom monitoring application named etop.

Passive Localization: Large Size Sensor Network Localization Based on Environmental Events
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
We develop a localization algorithm based on global environmental events observed by a sensor network. Examples of such events include the sound of thunder, the shades of moving clouds, or the vibrations in seismic data. Because our localization method does not generate signals for distance measurements, it saves energy. In fact, the algorithm may use existing sensor recordings to determine the locations of nodes at which the recordings were taken. Moreover, the method does not accumulate errors, making it also effective for large and sparse sensor networks. The localization uses time synchronization; we provide an algorithm to compensate for clock synchronization errors. Versions for both two dimensional and three dimensional localization of the algorithm are presented. Simulation results suggest that the algorithm can provide a high degree of accuracy when many events are recorded.

Moving-Baseline Localization
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
The moving-baseline localization (MBL) problem arises when a group of nodes moves through an environment in which no external coordinate reference is available. When group members cannot see or hear one another directly, each node must employ local sensing and inter-device communication to infer the spatial relationship and motion of all other nodes with respect to itself. We consider a setting in which nodes move with piecewise-linear velocities in the plane, and any node can exchange noisy range estimates with certain sufficiently nearby nodes. We develop a distributed solution to the MBL problem in the plane, in which each node performs robust hyperbola fitting, trilateration with velocity constraints, and subgraph alignment to arrive at a globally consistent view of the network expressed in its own "rest frame." Changes in any node's motion cause deviations between observed and predicted ranges at nearby nodes, triggering revision of the trajectory estimates computed by all nodes. We implement and analyze our algorithm in a simulation informed by the characteristics of a commercially available ultra-wideband (UWB) radio, and show that recovering node trajectories, rather than just locations, requires substantially less computation at each node. Finally, we quantify the minimum ranging rate and local network density required for the method's successful operation.

Pareto Frontiers of Sensor Networks for Localization
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
We develop a theory to predict the localization performance of randomly distributed sensor networks consisting of various sensor modalities when only a constant active subset of sensors that minimize localization error is used for estimation. The characteristics of the modalities include measurement type (bearing or range) and error, sensor reliability, FOV, sensing range, and mobility. We show that the localization performance of a sensor network is a function of a weighted sum of the total number of each sensor modality. We also show that optimization of this weighted sum is independent of how the sensor management strategy chooses the active sensors. We combine the utility objective with other objectives, such as lifetime, coverage and reliability to determine the best mix of sensors for an optimal sensor network design. The Pareto efficient frontier of the multi objectives are obtained with a dynamic program, which also accommodates additional convex constraints.

Motion data is preprocessed onboard mobile nodes and transferred to a static network of seed nodes using a delay tolerant protocol with minimal radio packet overhead.

Y-MAC: An Energy-Efficient Multi-channel MAC Protocol for Dense Wireless Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
As the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) becomes widespread, node density tends to increase. This poses a new challenge for medium access control (MAC) protocol design. Although traditional MAC protocols achieve low-power operation, they use only a single channel which limits their performance. Several multi-channel MAC protocols for WSNs have been recently proposed. One of the key observations is that these protocols are less energy efficient than single-channel MAC protocols under light traffic conditions. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient multichannel MAC protocol, Y-MAC, for WSNs. Our goal is to achieve both high performance and energy efficiency under diverse traffic conditions. In contrast to most of previous multi-channel MAC protocols for WSNs, we implemented Y-MAC on a real sensor node platform and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Experimental results show that Y-MAC is energy efficient and maintains high performance under high-traffic conditions.

On the Network Coding Advantage for Wireless Multicast in Euclidean Space
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
Multicast is a fundamental communication operation in wireless sensor networks whereby a source sensor transmits its information to a relevant subset of sensors in the network. Motivated by this, we study the advantage of network coding for minimizing the total power needed for multicast in wireless networks. We show that there is an absolute constant, depending only on the power gradient and the dimension of the underlying Euclidean space, that bounds the maximum advantage of network coding. An interesting aspect of our result is that it shows that the advantage of coding remains bounded by a constant even when compared to a multicast scheme without coding that is restricted to do only point-to-point transmissions.

A Practical Multi-channel Media Access Control Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
Despite availability of multiple orthogonal communication channels on common sensor network platforms, such as MicaZ motes, and despite multiple simulation-supported designs of multi-channel MAC protocols, most existing sensor networks use only one channel for communication, which is a source of bandwidth inefficiency. In this work, we design, implement, and experimentally evaluate a practical MAC protocol which utilizes multiple channels efficiently for WSNs. A control theory approach is used to dynamically allocate channels for each mote in a distributed manner transparently to the application and routing layers. The protocol assumes that sensor nodes are equipped with one half-duplex radio interface which is most common in current hardware platforms. The protocol does not require time synchronization among nodes and takes the channel switching cost of current hardware into account. Evaluation results on a real testbed show that it achieves a non-trivial bandwidth improvement using 802.15.4 radios in topologies which are typical in WSNs. The MAC protocol was implemented in TinyOS-2.x and packaged as a software component to enable seamless use with existing applications.

Effects of Correlated Shadowing: Connectivity, Localization, and RF Tomography
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
Unlike current models for radio channel shadowing indicate, real-world shadowing losses on different links in a network are not independent. The correlations have both detrimental and beneficial impacts on sensor, ad hoc, and mesh networks. First, the probability of network connectivity reduces when link shadowing correlations are considered. Next, the variance bounds for sensor self-localization change, and provide the insight that algorithms must infer localization information from link correlations in order to avoid significant degradation from correlated shadowing. Finally, a major benefit is that shadowing correlations between links enable the tomographic imaging of an environment from pairwise RSS measurements. This paper applies measurement-based models, and measurements themselves, to analyze and to verify both the benefits and drawbacks of correlated link shadowing.

Towards Real-Time Information Processing of Sensor Network Data Using Computationally Efficient Multi-output Gaussian Processes
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
In this paper, we describe a novel, computationally efficient algorithm that facilitates the autonomous acquisition of readings from sensor networks (deciding when and which sensor to acquire readings from at any time), and which can, with minimal domain knowledge, perform a range of information processing tasks including modelling the accuracy of the sensor readings, predicting the value of missing sensor readings, and predicting how the monitored environmental variables will evolve into the future. Our motivating scenario is the need to provide situational awareness support to first responders at the scene of a large scale incident, and to this end, we describe a novel iterative formulation of a multi-output Gaussian process that can build and exploit a probabilistic model of the environmental variables being measured (including the correlations and delays that exist between them). We validate our approach using data collected from a network of weather sensors located on the south coast of England.

Composable Information Gradients in Wireless Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
In sensor networks we aim to achieve global objectives through local decisions at each node, based only on data available in the node's neighborhood. In this paper, we diffuse information away from source nodes holding desired data, so as to establish information potentials that allow network queries to navigate towards and reach these sources through local greedy decisions, following information gradients. We compute these information potentials by solving for a discrete approximation to a partial differential equation over appropriate network neighborhoods, through a simple local iteration that can be executed in a distributed manner and can be re-invoked to repair the information field locally when links fail, sources move, etc. The solutions to this equation are classical harmonic functions, which have a rich algebraic structure and many useful properties, including the absence of local extrema, providing a guarantee that our local greedy navigation will not get stuck. Unlike shortest path trees, which can also be used to guide queries to sources, information potentials are robust to low-level link volatility as they reflect more global properties of the underlying connectivity. By exploiting the algebraic structure of harmonic functions such potentials can be combined in interesting ways to enable far greater path diversity and thus provide better load balancing than is possible with fixed tree structures, or they can be used to answer range queries about the number of sources in a certain regions by simply traversing the boundary of the region. Potentials for multiple information types can be aggregated and compressed using a variant of the q-digest data structure. The paper provides both analytic results and detailed simulations supporting these claims.

Distributed Online Simultaneous Fault Detection for Multiple Sensors

2008
Monitoring its health by detecting its failed sensors is essential to the reliable functioning of any sensor network. This paper presents a distributed, online, sequential algorithm for detecting multiple faults in a sensor network. The algorithm works by detecting change points in the correlation statistics of neighboring sensors, requiring only neighbors to exchange information. The algorithm provides guarantees on detection delay and false alarm probability. This appears to be the first work to offer such guarantees for a multiple sensor network. Based on the performance guarantees, we compute a tradeoff between sensor node density, detection delay and energy consumption. We also address synchronization, finite storage and data quantization. We validate our approach with some example applications.

ACE in the Hole: Adaptive Contour Estimation Using Collaborating Mobile Sensors
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
This paper focuses on the use of mobile sensors to estimate contours in a field. In particular, we focus on strategies to estimate the contour with minimum latency and maximum precision. We propose a novel algorithm, ACE (adaptive contour estimation), that (a) estimates and exploits information regarding the gradients in the field to move towards the contour and (b) uses a spread component to surround the contour in order to optimize latency. While it is possible for sensors to spread as they approach the contour, it is crucial to judiciously determine when and how much to spread. Spreading too early or too much may result in increasing the latency or affecting the precision. ACE dynamically makes this decision using local sensor measurements, history of measurements as well as collaboration between sensors while adapting to different types of deployment, distance from the contour and shapes of the contour. We demonstrate that ACE, in the absence of energy constraints precisely determines the contour with a lower latency than when only gradients are used for movement or when the sensors spread out right from the start of estimation.

Alert: An Adaptive Low-Latency Event-Driven MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
Collection of rare but delay-critical messages from a group of sensor nodes is a key process in many wireless sensor network applications. This is particularly important for security related applications like intrusion detection and fire alarm systems. An event sensed by multiple sensor nodes in the network can trigger many messages to be sent simultaneously. We present Alert, a MAC protocol for collecting event-triggered urgent messages from a group of sensor nodes with minimum latency and without requiring any cooperation or pre-scheduling among the senders or between senders and receiver during protocol execution. Alert is designed to handle multiple simultaneous messages efficiently and reliably minimizing the overall delay to collect all messages along with the delay to get the first message. Moreover, the ability to handle a large number of simultaneous messages does not come at the cost of excessive delays when only a few messages need to be handled. We analyze Alert and evaluate its feasibility and performance with an implementation on commodity hardware. We further compare Alert with existing approaches through simulations and show the performance improvement possible through Alert.

Fountain Codes Based Distributed Storage Algorithms for Large-Scale Wireless Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2008
We consider large-scale networks with n nodes, out of which k are in possession, (e.g., have sensed or collected in some other way) k information packets. In the scenarios in which network nodes are vulnerable because of, for example, limited energy or a hostile environment, it is desirable to disseminate the acquired information throughout the network so that each of the n nodes stores one (possibly coded) packet and the original k source packets can be recovered later in a computationally simple way from any (1 + isin)k nodes for some small isin &gt; 0. We developed two distributed algorithms for solving this problem based on simple random walks and Fountain codes. Unlike all previously developed schemes, our solution is truly distributed, that is, nodes do not know n, k or connectivity in the network, except in their own neighborhoods, and they do not maintain any routing tables. In the first algorithm, all the sensors have the knowledge of n and k. In the second algorithm, each sensor estimates these parameters through the random walk dissemination. We present analysis of the communication/transmission and encoding/decoding complexity of these two algorithms, and provide extensive simulation results as well.

Joint Routing and 2D Transform Optimization for Irregular Sensor Network Grids Using Wavelet Lifting
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
We address the joint optimization of routing and compression for wireless sensor networks using a lifting-based 2D transform that can be computed along arbitrary routing trees. The proposed 2D transform allows for unidirectional computation, thereby eliminating costly backward transmissions often required by existing 2D transforms. We also propose a framework for optimizing the transform by selecting among a different set of coding schemes (i.e., different levels in the wavelet decomposition). Since our transform can operate on arbitrary routing trees, we focus on the problem of jointly optimizing routing trees based on inter-node data correlation and inter-node distance. The two extreme solutions would be i) to route data along paths that maximize inter-node data correlation (at the risk of increasing transport costs), corresponding to a minimum spanning tree (MST), or ii) to follow shortest path tree (SPT) routing (where inter-node data correlation may not be as high). We propose an optimization technique that exhaustively searches for the optimal tree over a set of combinations of MST and SPT. We also propose a heuristic approximation algorithm that is amenable for use on larger networks and with which we observe total cost reductions close to 10% for some of the data.

LOCALE: Collaborative Localization Estimation for Sparse Mobile Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
As the field of sensor networks matures, research in this area is focusing not only on fixed networks, but also on mobile sensor networks. For many reasons, both technical and logistical, such networks will often be very sparse for all or part of their operation, sometimes functioning more as disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs). While much work has been done on localization methods for densely populated fixed networks, most of these methods are inefficient or ineffective for sparse mobile networks, where connections can be infrequent. While some mobile networks rely on fixed location beacons or per-node, onboard GPS, these methods are not always possible due to cost, power and other constraints. In this paper we present the Low-density Collaborative Ad-Hoc Localization Estimation (LOCALE) system for sparse sensor networks. In LOCALE, each node estimates its own position, and collaboratively refines that location estimate by updating its prediction based on neighbors it encounters. Nodes also estimate (as a probability density function) the likelihood their prediction is accurate. We evaluate LOCALE'S collaborative localization both through real implementations running on sensor nodes, as well as through simulations of larger systems. We consider scenarios of varying density (down to 0.02 neighbors per communication attempt), as well as scenarios that demonstrate LOCALE'S resilience in the face of extremely-inaccurate individual nodes. Overall, our algorithms yield up to a median of 21X better accuracy for location estimation compared to existing approaches. In addition, by allowing nodes to refine location estimates collaboratively, LOCALE also reduces the need for fixed location beacons (i.e. GPS- enabled beacon towers) by as much as 64X.

On Boundary Recognition without Location Information in Wireless Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2008
Boundary recognition is an important and challenging issue in wireless sensor networks when no coordinates or distances are available. The distinction between inner and boundary nodes of the network can provide valuable knowledge to a broad spectrum of algorithms. This paper tackles the challenge of providing a scalable and range-free solution for boundary recognition that does not require a high node density. Our solution approximates the boundary of the sensor network by determining the inner nodes using geometric constructions that guarantee that, for a given d, a node lies inside of the construction for a d-quasi unit disk graph model of the wireless sensor network. Moreover, such geometric constructions make it possible to compute a guaranteed distance from a node to the boundary. We provide a thorough evaluation of our approach and show that it is applicable to dense as well as sparse deployments.

Using Echo State Networks for Anomaly Detection in Underground Coal Mines
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
We investigate the problem of identifying anomalies in monitoring critical gas concentrations using a sensor network in an underground coal mine. In this domain, one of the main problems is a provision of mine specific anomaly detection, with cyclical (moving) instead offlatline (static) alarm threshold levels. An additional practical difficulty in modelling a specific mine is the lack of fully labelled data of normal and abnormal situations. We present an approach addressing these difficulties based on echo state networks learning mine specific anomalies when only normal data is available. Echo state networks utilize incremental updates driven by new sensor readings, thus enabling a detection of anomalies at any time during the sensor network operation. We evaluate this approach against a benchmark - Bayesian network based anomaly detection, and observe that the quality of the overall predictions is comparable to the benchmark. However, the echo state networks maintain the same level of predictive accuracy for data from multiple sources. Therefore, the ability of echo state networks to model dynamical systems make this approach more suitable for anomaly detection and predictions in sensor networks.

This paper presents LiteOS, a multi-threaded operating system that provides Unix-like abstractions for wireless sensor networks. Aiming to be an easy-to-use platform, LiteOS offers a number of novel features, including: (1) a hierarchical file system and a wireless shell interface for user interaction using UNIX-like commands; (2) kernel support for dynamic loading and native execution of multithreaded applications; and (3) online debugging, dynamic memory, and file system assisted communication stacks. LiteOS also supports software updates through a separation between the kernel and user applications, which are bridged through a suite of system calls.

TinyECC: A Configurable Library for Elliptic Curve Cryptography in Wireless Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2008
Public key cryptography (PKC) has been the enabling technology underlying many security services and protocols in traditional networks such as the Internet. In the context of wireless sensor networks, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), one of the most efficient types of PKC, is being investigated to provide PKC support in sensor network applications so that the existing PKC-based solutions can be exploited. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of TinyECC, a configurable library for ECC operations in wireless sensor networks. The primary objective of TinyECC is to provide a ready-to-use, publicly available software package for ECC-based PKC operations that can be flexibly configured and integrated into sensor network applications. TinyECC provides a number of optimization switches, which can turn specific optimizations on or off based on developers' needs. Different combinations of the optimizations have different execution time and resource consumptions, giving developers great flexibility in integrating TinyECC into sensor network applications. This paper also reports the experimental evaluation of TinyECC on several common sensor platforms, including MICAz, Tmote Sky, and Imotel. The evaluation results show the impacts of individual optimizations on the execution time and resource consumptions, and give the most computationally efficient and the most storage efficient configuration of TinyECC.

Towards Energy Efficient Design of Multi-radio Platforms for Wireless Sensor Networks

2008
We study the problem of concurrently supporting multiple radios with different capabilities and interfaces on a single sensor node platform. Through a detailed experimental study on hardware multi-radio platforms, using the two representative radio technologies 802.15.4 and 802.11, we identify bottlenecks and design tradeoffs that are usually overlooked and that, as we show, have a significant impact on the sensor network's performance and energy efficiency. Our findings are threefold. We show that a proper pairing of processor and radio is crucial for taking the full advantage of the energy efficiency of higher bandwidth radios. The processor/radio pairing affects the energy balance of a sensor node, thus making the design of dynamic switching among multiple radios more challenging. Second, we demonstrate and quantify the impact of network traffic on energy consumption of a sensor node while varying network parameters, and illustrate the deficiency of existing energy-optimizing protocols. Our results indicate that by properly adjusting network parameters, such as packet size and transmission period, energy savings of up to 50% can be achieved under heavy network traffic conditions when a CSMA-based MAC is used. We conclude by presenting a set of guidelines for designing and implementing energy efficient multi-radio platforms.

Deriving State Machines from TinyOS Programs Using Symbolic Execution

2008
The most common programming languages and platforms for sensor networks foster a low-level programming style. This design provides fine-grained control over the underlying sensor devices, which is critical given their severe resource constraints. However, this design also makes programs difficult to understand, maintain, and debug. In this paper, we describe an approach to automatically recover the high-level system logic from such low-level programs, along with an instantiation of the approach for nesC programs running on top of the TinyOS operating system. We adapt the technique of symbolic execution from the program analysis community to handle the event-driven nature of TinyOS, providing a generic component for approximating the behavior of a sensor network application or system component. We then employ a form of predicate abstraction on the resulting information to automatically produce a finite state machine representation of the component. We have used our tool, called FSMGen, to automatically produce compact and fairly accurate state machines for several TinyOS applications and protocols. We illustrate how this high-level program representation can be used to aid programmer understanding, error detection, and program validation.

We present iCount, a new energy meter design. For many systems that have a built-in switching regulator, adding a single wire between the regulator and the microcontroller enables real-time energy metering. iCount measures energy usage by counting the switching cycles of the regulator. We show that the relationship between load current and switching frequency is quite linear and demonstrate that this simple design can be applied to a variety of regulators. Our particular implementation exhibits a maximum error of less than plusmn20% over five decades of current draw, a resolution exceeding 1 muJ, a read latency of 15 mus, and a power overhead that ranges from 1% when the node is in standby to 0.01 % when the node is active, for a typical workload. The basic iCount design requires only a pulse frequency modulated switching regulator and a microcontroller with an externally-clocked counter.

TRANSACT: A Transactional Framework for Programming Wireless Sensor/Actor Networks

2008
Effectively managing concurrent execution is one of the biggest challenges for future wireless sensor/actor networks (WSANs): for safety reasons concurrency needs to be tamed to prevent unintentional nondeterministic executions, on the other hand, for real-time guarantees concurrency needs to be boosted to achieve timeliness. We propose a transactional, optimistic concurrency control framework for WSANs that enables understanding of a system execution as a single thread of control, while permitting the deployment of actual execution over multiple threads distributed on several nodes. By exploiting the atomicity and broadcast properties of singlehop wireless communication, we provide a lightweight implementation of our transactional framework on the motes platform.

Opportunistic Aggregation over Duty Cycled Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
To implement duty cycles with packet based transceivers, a sender transmits a trail of identical packets (which we call framelets) of which the receiver is able to catch one in its active listening phase. This communication concept is used in the standard low power listening (LPL) protocol shipped with TinyOS 2.x. This existing solution has many shortcomings which result in a very limited network performance. In this paper, we firstly present an alternative framelet based low power listening implementation called Framelet Communications (FrameComm) that eliminates these shortcomings. Secondly, we present a novel additional improvement to FrameComm - Interception and Aggregation of Framelet Communications (i-FrameComm) - that further improves network performance by opportunistically aggregating packets over the radio channel. A prototype implementation of the proposed FrameComm mechanism in TinyOS 2.02 on TelosB nodes is used for evaluation and comparison. The experiments show that the interception and aggregation method increases network throughput and lifetime as communication resources are used more efficiently.

Real-Time Human Posture Reconstruction in Wireless Smart Camera Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
While providing a variety of intriguing application opportunities, a vision sensor network poses three key challenges. High computation capacity is required for early vision functions to enable real-time performance. Wireless links limit image transmission in the network due to both bandwidth and energy concerns. Last but not least, there is a lack of established vision-based fusion mechanisms when a network of cameras is available. In this paper a distributed vision processing implementation of human pose interpretation on a wireless smart camera network is presented. The motivation for employing distributed processing is to both achieve real-time vision and provide scalability for developing more complex vision algorithms. The distributed processing operation includes two levels. One is that each smart camera processes its local vision data, achieving spatial parallelism. The other is that different functionalities of the whole line of vision processing are assigned to early vision and object-level processors, achieving functional parallelism based on the processor capabilities. Aiming for low power consumption and high image processing performance, the wireless smart camera is based on an SIMD (single-instruction multiple-data) video analysis processor, an 8051 micro-controller as the local host, and wireless communication through the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The vision algorithm implements 3D human pose reconstruction. From the live image data from the sensor the smart camera acquires critical joints of the subject in the scene through local processing. The results obtained by multiple smart cameras are then transmitted through the wireless channel to a central PC where the 3D pose is recovered and demonstrated in a virtual reality gaming application. The system operates in real time with a 30 frames/sec rate.

Environmental monitoring constitutes an important field of application for wireless sensor networks. Given the severity of potential climate changes, environmental impact on cities, and pollution, it is a domain where sensor networks can have great impact and as such, is getting more and more attention. Current data collection techniques are indeed rather limited and make use of very expensive sensing stations, leading to a lack of appropriate observations. In this paper, we present SensorScope, a collaborative project between environmental and network researchers, that aims at providing an efficient and inexpensive out-of-the-box environmental monitoring system, based on a wireless sensor network. We especially focus on data gathering and present the hardware and network architecture of SensorScope. We also describe a real-world deployment, which took place on a rock glacier in Switzerland, as well as the results we obtained.

When Timing Matters: Enabling Time Accurate and Scalable Simulation of Sensor Network Applications

2008
The rising complexity of data processing algorithms in sensor networks combined with their severely limited computing power necessitates an in-depth understanding of their temporal behavior. However, today only cycle accurate emulation and test-beds provide a detailed and accurate insight into the temporal behavior of sensor networks. In this paper we introduce fine grained, automated instrumentation of simulation models with cycle counts derived from sensor nodes and application binaries to provide detailed timing information. The presented approach bridges the gap between scalable but abstracting simulation and cycle accurate emulation for sensor network evaluation. By mapping device-specific code with simulation models, we can derive the time and duration a certain code line takes to get executed on a sensor node. Hence, eliminating the need to use expensive instruction-level emulators with limited speed and restricted scalability. Furthermore, the proposed design is not bound to a specific hardware platform, a major advantage compared to existing emulators. Our evaluation shows that the proposed technique achieves a timing accuracy of 99% compared to emulation while adding only a small overhead. Concluding, it combines essential properties like accuracy, speed and scalability on a single simulation platform.

On the Design of MAC Protocols for Low-Latency Hard Real-Time Discrete Control Applications over 802.15.4 Hardware
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
Discrete event control loops in modern-day machines often comprise a large number of sensors (50-200) reporting to a controller. Many discrete control applications must cater to hard real-time requirements i.e., sensors must communicate the occurrence of critical events to the controller within a real-time deadline (usually 5-50 ms) specified by the control system's design requirements. Messages reached after this deadline are considered lost. In the event of traffic bursts where several sensors may attempt to communicate with the PLC at the same time, messages from all the sensors must reach within the specified deadline. The metric for performance in such systems is then the probability that a message from all the sensors succeeds in being received at the controller within this deadline. Further, for such solutions to be viable, the sensors must last for several years without requiring change of batteries. In this paper we examine the potential for using 802.15.4 based radios for wireless sensing in low-latency hard real-time discrete event control applications.

Distributed acoustic sensing underlies an increasingly important class of sensor network applications, from habitat monitoring and bioacoustic census to security applications and virtual fences. VoxNet is a complete hardware and software platform for distributed acoustic monitoring applications that focuses on three key goals: (1) rapid deployment in realistic environments; (2) a high level programming language that abstracts the user from platform and network details and compiles into a high performance distributed application; and (3) an interactive usage model based on run-time installable programs, with the ability to run the same high level program seamlessly over live or stored data. The VoxNet hardware is self-contained and weather-resistant, and supports a four-channel microphone array with automated time synchronization, localization, and network coordination. Using VoxNet, an investigator can visualize phenomena in real-time, develop and tune online analysis, and record raw data for off-line analysis and archival. This paper describes both the hardware and software elements of the platform, as well as the architecture required to support distributed programs running over a heterogeneous network. We characterize the performance of the platform, using both microbenchmarks that evaluate specific aspects of the platform and a real application running in the field.

This paper describes a new embedded networked sensor platform architecture that combines hardware and software tools providing detailed, fine-grained real-time energy usage information. We introduce the LEAP2 platform, a qualitative step forward over the previously developed LEAP and other similar platforms. LEAP2 is based on anew low power ASIC system and generally applicable supporting architecture that provides unprecedented capabilities for directly observing energy usage of multiple subsystems in real-time. Real-time observation with microsecond-scale time resolution enables direct accounting of energy dissipation for each computing task as well as for each hardware subsystem. The new hardware architecture is exploited with our new software tools, etop and endoscope. A series of experimental investigations provide high-resolution power information in networking, storage, memory and processing for primary embedded networked sensing applications. Using results obtained in real-time we show that for a large class of wireless sensor network nodes, there exist several interdependencies in energy consumption between different subsystems. Through the use of our measurement tools we demonstrate that by carefully selecting the system operating points, energy savings of over 60% can be achieved while retaining system performance.

HERMES: A Software Architecture for Visibility and Control in Wireless Sensor Network Deployments
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2008
Designing reliable software for sensor networks is challenging because application developers have little visibility into, and understanding of the post-deployment behavior of code executing on resource constrained nodes in remote and ill-reproducible environments. To address this problem, this paper presents HERMES, a lightweight framework and prototype tool that provides fine-grained visibility and control of a sensor node's software at run-time. HERMES's architecture is based on the notion of interposition, which enables it to provide these properties in a minimally intrusive manner, without requiring any modification to software applications being observed and controlled. HERMES provides a general, extensible, and easy-to-use framework for specifying which software components to observe and control as well as when and how this observation and control is done. We have implemented and tested a fully functional prototype of HERMES for the SOS sensor operating system. Our performance evaluation, using real sensor nodes as well as cycle-accurate simulation, shows that HERMES successfully achieves its objective of providing fine-grained and dynamic visibility and control without incurring significant resource overheads. We demonstrate the utility and flexibility of HERMES by using our prototype to design, implement, and evaluate three case-studies: debugging and testing deployed sensor network applications, performing transparent software updates in sensor nodes, and implementing network traffic shaping and resource policing.

Koala: Ultra-Low Power Data Retrieval in Wireless Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
We present Koala, a reliable data retrieval system designed to operate at permille (.1%) duty cycles, essential for long term environmental monitoring networks. Koala achieves these low duty cycles by letting the network's nodes sleep most of the time and reviving them through an efficient wake-up strategy whenever the gateway performs a bulk data download. Unlike other systems which consume energy to maintain consistent network state (e.g. routes, sleep schedules, etc.) across the network's nodes, Koala maintains no persistent routing state on the motes. Instead, a basestation calculates the network paths using reachability information collected by the motes. The flexible control protocol (FCP), a protocol we developed, is then used to install this routing information on the network's nodes. This paradigm of operation not only eliminates the overhead of maintaining routing state, but also significantly reduces the complexity of the networking code running on the motes. Results from simulation and an actual implementation on TinyOS 2 indicate that Koala can achieve very low duty cycles under a wide range of download and network sizes.

We present DIP, a data discovery and dissemination protocol for wireless networks. Prior approaches, such as Trickle or SPIN, have overheads that scale linearly with the number of data items. For T items, DIP can identify new items with 0(log(T)) packets while maintaining a O(l) detection latency. To achieve this performance in a wide spectrum of network configurations, DIP uses a hybrid approach of randomized scanning and tree-based directed searches. By dynamically selecting which of the two algorithms to use, DIP outperforms both in terms of transmissions and speed. Simulation and testbed experiments show that DIP sends 20-60% fewer packets than existing protocols and can be 200% faster, while only requiring O(log(log(T))) additional state per data item.

Seluge: Secure and DoS-Resistant Code Dissemination in Wireless Sensor Networks
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
Wireless sensor networks are considered ideal candidates for a wide range of applications, such as industry monitoring, data acquisition in hazardous environments, and military operations. It is desirable and sometimes necessary to reprogram sensor nodes through wireless links after deployment, due to, for example, the need of removing bugs and adding new functionalities. The process of propagating a new code image to the nodes in a wireless sensor network is referred to as code dissemination. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an efficient, secure, robust, and DoS-resistant code dissemination system named Seluge for wireless sensor networks. Seluge is a secure extension to Deluge, an open source, state-of-the-art code dissemination system for wireless sensor networks. It provides security protections for code dissemination, including the integrity protection of code images and immunity from, to the best of our knowledge, all DoS attacks that exploit code dissemination protocols. Seluge is superior to all previous attempts for secure code dissemination, and is the only solution that seamlessly integrates the security mechanisms and the Deluge efficient propagation strategies. Besides the theoretical analysis that demonstrates the security and performance of Seluge, this paper also reports the experimental evaluation of Seluge in a network of MicaZ motes, which shows the efficiency of Seluge in practice.

Rateless Deluge: Over-the-Air Programming of Wireless Sensor Networks Using Random Linear Codes
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
Over-the-air programming (OAP) is a fundamental service in sensor networks that relies upon reliable broadcast for efficient dissemination. As such, existing OAP protocols become decidedly inefficient (with respect to energy, communication or delay) in unreliable broadcast environments, such as those with relatively high node density or noise. In this paper, we consider OAP approaches based on rateless codes, which significantly improve OAP in such environments by drastically reducing the need for packet rebroadcasting. We thus design and implement two rateless OAP protocols, rateless Deluge and ACKless Deluge, both of which replace the data transfer mechanism of the established OAP Deluge protocol with rateless analogs. Experiments with Tmote Sky motes on single-hop networks with packet loss rates of 7% show these protocols to save significantly in communication over regular Deluge (roughly 15-30% savings in the data plane, and 50-80% in the control plane), and multi-hop experiments reveal similar trends. Simulations further shows that our new protocols scale better than standard Deluge (in terms of communication and energy) to high network density. TinyOS code for our implementation can be found at http://nislab.bu.edu.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a dual-camera sensor network that can be used as a memory assistant tool for assisted living. Our system performs energy-efficient object detection and recognition of commonly misplaced objects. The novelty in our approach is the ability to tradeoff between recognition accuracy and computational efficiency by employing a combination of low complexity but less precise color histogram-based image recognition together with more complex image recognition using SIFT descriptors. In addition, our system can seamlessly integrate feedback from the user to improve the robustness of object recognition. Experimental results reveal that our system is computation-efficient and adaptive to slow changes of environmental conditions.

Toward Community Sensing

A great opportunity exists to fuse information from populations of privately-held sensors to create useful sensing applications. For example, GPS devices, embedded in cellphones and automobiles, might one day be employed as distributed networks of velocity sensors for traffic monitoring and routing. Unfortunately, privacy and resource considerations limit access to such data streams. We describe principles of community sensing that offer mechanisms for sharing data from privately held sensors. The methods take into account the likely availability of sensors, the context-sensitive value of sensor information, based on models of phenomena and demand, and sensor owners' preferences about privacy and resource usage. We present efficient and well-characterized approximations of optimal sensing policies. We provide details on key principles of community sensing and highlight their use within a case study for road traffic monitoring.

Identification of Low-Level Point Radiation Sources Using a Sensor Network
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
Identification of a low-level point radiation source amidst background radiation is achieved by a network of radiation sensors using a two-step approach. Based on measurements from three sensors, the geometric difference triangulation method is used to estimate the location and strength of the source. Then a sequential probability ratio test based on current measurements and estimated parameters is employed to finally decide: (1) the presence of a source with the estimated parameters, or (2) the absence of the source, or (3) the insufficiency of measurements to make a decision. This method achieves specified levels of false alarm and missed detection probabilities, while ensuring a close-to-minimal number of measurements for reaching a decision. This method minimizes the ghost-source problem of current estimation methods, and achieves a lower false alarm rate compared with current detection methods. This method is tested and demonstrated using: (1) simulations, and (2) a test-bed that utilizes the scaling properties of point radiation sources to emulate high intensity ones that cannot be easily and safely handled in laboratory experiments.

On the Use of Mutual Information to Compare the Performance of Wireless Sensor Networks in Detection Applications
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
The problem of choosing among candidate wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that send data to a fusion center to detect a binary phenomenon in nature is considered. Viewing the system as a communication channel in which nature is the transmitter and the fusion center is the receiver, it is intuitive to prefer the system that provides the highest mutual information between the phenomenon and the received signal at the fusion center. This paper reviews existing literature on this criterion and provides complementary results showing that, under a Bayesian framework, a WSN that provides equal or higher mutual information than other WSNs results in equal or better detection performance only in very restrictive settings. This paper also presents a bound on the detection performance of a WSN having the highest mutual information, and it is shown that the bound becomes tight as the mutual information approaches its maximum. Similar conclusions are obtained in the Neyman-Pearson framework.

The BehaviorScope provides a runtime, user-programmable framework that processes streams of timestamped sensor data along with prior context information to infer activities and generate appropriate notifications. Human activities are described in high-level scripts that are directly mapped to a hierarchy of probabilistic grammars that parse low-level sensor measurements into high-level distinguishable activities. Activities of interest are pre-programmed into a specification that is used by the system to interpret the incoming sensor data stream. The system interprets the activities to generate summaries and other triggered notifications that are propagated to stakeholders via email and cell-phone text messages.

Demonstration of Active Guidance with SmartCane
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
The usage of conventional assistive cane devices is critical in reducing the risk of falls, which are particularly detrimental for the elderly and disabled. Many of the individuals that experience the greatest risk of falling rely on cane devices for support of ambulation. However, the results of many studies have shown that incorrect cane usage is prevalent among cane users. The original SmartCane assistive system has been developed to provide a method for acquiring detailed motion data from cane usage. The cane itself, however, lacks any type of programmability as well as real-time data processing algorithms to provide feedback to the cane user. In this demonstration, we have incorporated an embedded computing platform into SmartCane and developed a real-time sensor information processing algorithm that provides direct detection of cane usage characteristics. The new system provides local data processing capability by classifying whether an individual is executing a stride with proper cane motion and applied forces. It also provides direct feedback information to the individual, thereby guiding the subject towards proper cane usage and reducing the risk of falls.

EcoDAQ: A Densely Distributed, High Bandwidth Wireless Data Acquisition System
2008 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2008
Current wireless sensor networks achieve dense deployment by low duty cycling. Unfortunately, this represents a great mismatch with many real-world applications that require non-trivial data rates. To solve these issues above, we propose EcoDAQ, a new densely distributed wireless data acquisition system with a relatively high data rate. We implement a MAC layer protocol that minimizes complexity and memory footprint on the sensor node while guaranteeing collision freedom, without using multiple frequency channels. As a result, this work is not only highly scalable to at least 50 active nodes per squared meter, but at the same time the low complexity minimizes the cost of these ultra-compact sensor devices. The full demo would show a system deployment with a minimum of 50 active sensors on a poster board of 1 m2 area. The monitoring station keeps gathering up to 500 accelerometer data samples per second from all of these 50 sensor nodes and displays them simultaneously on a fifty-screen tiled display system. A portable version that emulates the tiled screens in a reduced size will be shown at the conference.

We present Epic, an open mote platform for application-driven design. Sensornet platforms, like most embedded systems, are tightly coupled to their applications. This coupling can make it difficult for general-purpose platforms to address application-specific needs, forcing platform designers to repeatedly reimplement functionality. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of software and integrated circuit design, we propose sensornet platforms be composed hierarchically from a family of modular components. This approach makes platform development accessible to a much wider community; developers do not need to be analog, sensor, or radio frequency experts, and can instead reuse components that encapsulate the needed functionality.

Visibility has been a key challenge for wireless sensor network applications. Deployed on the extremely resource-constrained mote platform, such applications may fail unexpectedly, or exhibit behavior different from their intended goals. To help understand why such problems occur, we design and implement an event trace logger based on the LiteOS operating system, which allows us to partially reconstruct application behavior after execution, such as which path it took for an IF statement, its invocation history of the kernel system calls, and its dynamics across multiple nodes. We plan to demonstrate the usefulness of this event trace logger and its translator using a multi-hop routing application.

Interference Detection and Mitigation in IEEE 802.15.4 Networks

Proper frequency planning is essential to enable multiple IEEE 802.15.4 networks to coexist in the same space, otherwise the network performance can be adversely affected due to interference. While this may be feasible for static networks, it is not really an option for mobile networks such as body area networks due to the dynamic nature of these interactions. This work demonstrates one approach to detecting and mitigating interference in IEEE 802.15.4 networks from other 802.15.4 networks. Interference is detected by observing packets from other networks while the mitigation strategy leverages collaboration between interfering networks to determine which network should switch to a different channel. The approach can also work with legacy networks that do not implement this protocol. The system is implemented and demonstrated on Intel Mote2 devices running Tiny OS.

Web-based social networks such as Linkedln, FaceBook and MySpace have gained wide popularity in recent years. With the advent of ubiquitous sensing, future social networks will be cyber-physical, combining measured elements of the physical world with manual human input. Microsoft SensorMap is an early example of a cyber-physical network in that it allows users to browse the physical world. In contrast to social networks, however, the main abstractions exported by SensorMap are those of physical objects (such as sensors), not people. This paper extends the concept of SensorMap to incorporate social entities such as individuals and special-interest communities to which they belong. In the extended network, called SenseWorld, SensorMap offers a geographical index into a cyber-physical social network with its own logical topology derived from social connections.

Secure and highly-available aggregation queries in large-scale sensor networks via set sampling
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
Wireless sensor networks are often queried for aggregates such as predicate count, sum, and average. In untrusted environments, sensors may potentially be compromised. Existing approaches for securely answering aggregation queries in untrusted sensor networks can detect whether the aggregation result is corrupted by an attacker. However, the attacker (controlling the compromised sensors) can keep corrupting the result, rendering the system unavailable. This paper aims to enable aggregation queries to tolerate instead of just detecting the adversary. To this end, we propose a novel tree sampling algorithm that directly uses sampling to answer aggregation queries. It leverages a novel set sampling technique to overcome a key and well-known obstacle in sampling - traditional sampling technique is only effective when the predicate count or sum is large. Set sampling can efficiently sample a set of sensors together, and determine whether any sensor in the set satisfies the predicate (but not how many). With set sampling as a building block, tree sampling can provably generate a correct answer despite adversarial interference, while without the drawbacks of traditional sampling techniques.

Dialog codes for secure wireless communications
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
We investigate the feasibility of achieving perfect secrecy in wireless network communications without shared secrets. We introduce a secure coding problem in which not only the sender but also the receiver participates in the coding. In essence, the receiver's role is to selectively jam the sender's transmission at the level of bits, bytes, or packets. We then design a class of secure codes, which we call dialog codes, for diverse channel models and receiver models. Our codes are simple and efficient, with only O(1) complexity in both the encoding and the decoding process, and achieve optimal coding rate in some channel models. This, along with their potential for augmenting security and/or simplifying security bootstrapping, makes them worthy of consideration for resource-constrained wireless sensor network devices. By way of experimental validation, we study the channel jamming characteristics of extant mote radios - specifically, CC2420 (IEEE 802.15.4) and CC1000 - in experiments, observe their time-varying channel behavior, and demonstrate the correctness and robustness of implementations of our dialog codes at the byte-level and at the packet-level in the presence of dynamic channel fluctuations.

2009
Identification of wireless sensor nodes based on the characteristics of their radio transmissions can provide an additional layer of security in all-wireless multi-hop sensor networks. Reliable identification can be means for the detection and/or prevention of wormhole, Sybil and replication attacks, and can complement cryptographic message authentication protocols. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of transient-based identification of CC2420 wireless sensor nodes. We propose a new technique for transient-based identification and show that it enables reliable and accurate sensor node recognition with an equal error rate as low as 0.0024 (0.24%). We investigate the performance of our technique in terms of parameters such as distance, antenna polarization and voltage and analyze how these parameters affect the recognition accuracy. Finally, we study the feasibility of certain types of impersonation attacks on the proposed technique.

Gradient clock synchronization in wireless sensor networks
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2009
Accurately synchronized clocks are crucial for many applications in sensor networks. Existing time synchronization algorithms provide on average good synchronization between arbitrary nodes, however, as we show in this paper, close-by nodes in a network may be synchronized poorly. We propose the gradient time synchronization protocol (GTSP) which is designed to provide accurately synchronized clocks between neighbors. GTSP works in a completely decentralized fashion: Every node periodically broadcasts its time information. Synchronization messages received from direct neighbors are used to calibrate the logical clock. The algorithm requires neither a tree topology nor a reference node, which makes it robust against link and node failures. The protocol is implemented on the Mica2 platform using TinyOS. We present an evaluation of GTSP on a 20-node testbed setup and simulations on larger network topologies.

Event-triggered distributed optimization in sensor networks
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
Many problems in sensor networks can be formulated as optimization problems. Existing distributed optimization algorithms typically rely on choosing a step size to ensure convergence. In this case, the communication between sensor nodes occurs each time the computations are carried out. Since in sensor networks, the energy required for communication can be significantly greater than the energy required to perform computation, it would be beneficial if we can somehow separate communication and computation. This paper presents such a distributed algorithm called the event-triggered algorithm. Under event triggering, each agent broadcasts to its neighbors when a local ldquoerrorrdquo signal exceeds a state dependent threshold. We give a general class of problems in sensor networks where the event-triggered algorithm can be used. In particular, this paper uses the data gathering problem as an example. We propose an event-triggered distributed algorithm and prove its convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the number of message exchanges by two orders of magnitude compared to commonly used dual decomposition algorithms. It also enjoys better scalability with respect to the depth of the tree and the maximum branch number of the tree.

Recovering temporal integrity with Data Driven Time Synchronization
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
Data driven time synchronization (DDTS) provides synchronization across sensors by using underlying characteristics of data collected by an embedded sensing system. We apply the concept of data driven time synchronization through a seismic deployment consisting of 100 seismic sensors to repair data that was not time synchronized correctly. This deployment used GPS for time synchronization, but due to system faults common to environmental sensing systems, data was collected with large time offsets. In seismic deployments, offset data is often never used, but we show that data driven time synchronization can recover the synchronization and make the data usable. To implement data driven time synchronization to repair the time offsets we use microseisms as the underlying characteristics. Microseisms are waves that travel through the earth's crust and are independent of the seismic events used for the study of the earth's structure. We have developed a model of microseism propagation through a linear seismic array and use the model to obtain time correction shifts. By simulating time offsets in real data which does not have offsets, we determined that this method is able to repair the offset to between 0.05 and 0.2 seconds. Our ongoing work will attempt to refine the model to correct the offsets to less than 0.05 seconds and evaluate how errors in the correction affect seismic results such as event location. Data driven time synchronization may be applicable to other high data rate embedded sensing applications such as acoustic source localization.

Automating rendezvous and proxy selection in sensornets

None
2009
As the diversity of sensornet use cases increases, the combinations of environments and applications that will coexist will make custom engineering increasingly impractical. We investigate an approach that focuses on replacing custom engineering with automated optimization of declarative protocol specifications. Specifically, we automate network rendezvous and proxy selection from program source. These optimizations perform program transformations that are grounded in recursive query optimization, an area of database theory. Our prototype system implementation can automatically choose program executions that are as much as three, and usually one order of magnitude better than original source programs.

Archetype-based design: Sensor network programming for application experts, not just programming experts
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2009
Sensor network application experts such as biologists, geologists, and environmental engineers generally have little experience with, and little patience for, general-purpose and often low-level sensor network programming languages. We believe sensor network languages should be designed for application experts, who may not be expert programmers. To further that goal, we propose the concepts of sensor network application archetypes, archetype-specific languages, and archetype templates. Our work makes the following contributions. (1) We have examined a wide range of wireless sensor networks to develop a taxonomy of seven archetypes. This taxonomy permits the design of compact languages that are appropriate for novice programmers. (2) We developed a language (named WASP) and its associated compiler for a commonly encountered archetype. (3) We conducted user studies to evaluate the suitability of WASP and several alternatives for novice programmers. To the best of our knowledge, this 56-hour 28-user study is the first to evaluate a broad range of sensor network languages (TinyScript, Tiny-SQL, SwissQM, and TinyTemplate). On average, users of other languages successfully implemented their assigned applications 30.6% of the time. Among the successful completions, the average development time was 21.7 minutes. Users of WASP had an average success rate of 80.6%, and an average development time of 12.1 minutes (an improvement of 44.4%).

Distributed resource management and matching in sensor networks
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
We consider a scenario in which there are resources at or near nodes of a network, which are either static (e.g. fire stations, parking spots) or mobile (e.g. police cars). Over time, events (fires, crime reports, cars looking for parking) arise one-by-one at arbitrary nodes, and need to be quickly matched to and serviced by an appropriate nearby resource, without knowledge of future requests, and without the ability to alter any decision once it has been made. We develop distributed algorithms to direct available resources in the network to these events (or vice versa) in a coordinated fashion, so that no two resources are assigned to the same event, and the total distance of the events from their matched resources is minimized. The key idea is to extract, in a preprocessing stage, a well-separated tree metric that approximates the original network metric by a logarithmic distortion, allowing greedy matching algorithms to generate close to optimal matchings, and enabling communication-efficient probing-based algorithms for events to detect nearby available resources. The distributed matching algorithm requires no global coordination and achieves polylogarithmic performance ratio in both online and offline settings. Simulation experiments corroborate the theoretical results on solution quality and further evaluate the communication costs of our scheme in practice.

Predictive QoS routing to mobile sinks in wireless sensor networks
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
We present an algorithm for data delivery to mobile sinks in wireless sensor networks. Our algorithm is based on information potentials, which we extend to account for mobility. We show that for local movement along edges in the communication graph, the information potentials can be adapted using a simple iterative distributed computation. However, for non-local movement, the potential field might change significantly, and iterative computation leads to packet loss and packet delivery delays. We address this problem by introducing the mobility graph, which encodes knowledge about likely mobility patterns within the network. The mobility graph can be extracted from training data and is used to predict future relay nodes for the mobile node. Using the mobility graph, we can precompute and efficiently store additional routing states in the network. This enables the algorithm to maintain uninterrupted data streams. We analyze the benefits of computing and maintaining a mobility graph, and show that the information contained therein can be used to improve routing reliability in experiments involving mobile sinks.

On hierarchical routing in wireless sensor networks
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
Hierarchical routing is a promising approach for point-to-point routing with very small routing state. While there are many theoretical analyses and high-level simulations demonstrating its benefits, there has been little work to evaluate it in a realistic wireless sensor network setting. Based on numerous proposed hierarchical routing infrastructures, we develop a framework that captures the common characteristics of the infrastructures and identifies design points where the infrastructures differ. We then evaluate the implementation of the framework in TOSSIM and on a 60-node testbed. We demonstrate that from the practical perspective hierarchical routing is also an appealing routing approach for sensor networks. Despite only logarithmic routing state, it can offer low routing stretch: the average of ~1.25 and the 99-th percentile of 2. Moreover, a hierarchical routing infrastructure can be autonomously bootstrapped and maintained by the nodes. By exploring the design points within our framework, the hierarchy maintenance protocol can optimize different metrics, such as the latency of bootstrapping and repairing the hierarchy after failures or the traffic volume, depending on the application requirements. Finally, we also identify a number of practical issues which we believe the applications employing hierarchical routing should be aware of.

Application-informed radio duty-cycling in a re-taskable multi-user sensing system
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
As sensor networks mature, there will be an increasing need for re-usable, dynamically taskable software systems that support multiple concurrent applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy management in such systems, taking Tenet as a case study. Our work considers energy management under three new constraints: dynamic multi-hop routing and tasking, multiple concurrent applications, and reliable end-toend data delivery. We present AEM, an energy management system that satisfies these constraints. AEM statically analyzes and infers the traffic profile for the application and accordingly tunes the duty-cycling protocol to provide the best trade-off in latency and data delivery performance. Furthermore, unlike other duty-cycling protocols with pre-computed or fixed transmission and reception time slots, AEM uses elastic schedules that allows it to adapt to dynamics while enabling bounded latency of event detection. Our experiments show that AEM achieves 1-3% duty-cycles, while allowing concurrent applications to transmit 100% of the sensor data in a multi-hop 40-node network testbed.

Improving the speed and scalability of distributed simulations of sensor networks
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
Distributed simulation techniques are commonly used to improve the speed and scalability of wireless sensor network simulators. However, accurate simulations of dynamic interactions of sensor network applications incur large synchronization overheads and severely limit the performance of existing distributed simulators. In this paper, we present two novel techniques that significantly reduce such overheads by minimizing the number of sensor node synchronizations during simulations. These techniques work by exploiting radio and MAC specific characteristics without reducing simulation accuracy. In addition, we present a new probing mechanism that makes it possible to exploit any potential application specific characteristics for synchronization reductions. We implement and evaluate these techniques in a cycle accurate distributed simulation framework that we developed based on Avrora. In our experiments, the radio-level technique achieves a speedup of 2 to 3 times in simulating 1-hop networks with 32 to 256 nodes. With default backoffs, the MAC-level technique achieves a speedup of 1.1 to 1.3 times in the best case scenarios of simulating 32 and 64 nodes. In our multi-hop flooding tests, together they achieve a speedup of 1.5 to 1.8 times in simulating networks with 36 to 144 nodes. The experiments also demonstrate that the speedups can be significantly larger as the techniques scale with the number of processors and radio-off/MAC-backoff time.

Simultaneous placement and scheduling of sensors
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
We consider the problem of monitoring spatial phenomena, such as road speeds on a highway, using wireless sensors with limited battery life. A central question is to decide where to locate these sensors to best predict the phenomenon at the unsensed locations. However, given the power constraints, we also need to determine when to selectively activate these sensors in order to maximize the performance while satisfying lifetime requirements. Traditionally, these two problems of sensor placement and scheduling have been considered separately from each other; one first decides where to place the sensors, and then when to activate them. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm, ESPASS, that simultaneously optimizes the placement and the schedule. We prove that ESPASS provides a constant-factor approximation to the optimal solution of this NP-hard optimization problem. A salient feature of our approach is that it obtains ldquobalancedrdquo schedules that perform uniformly well over time, rather than only on average. We then extend the algorithm to allow for a smooth power-accuracy tradeoff. Our algorithm applies to complex settings where the sensing quality of a set of sensors is measured, e.g., in the improvement of prediction accuracy (more formally, to situations where the sensing quality function is submodular). We present extensive empirical studies on several sensing tasks, and our results show that simultaneously placing and scheduling gives drastically improved performance compared to separate placement and scheduling (e.g., a 33% improvement in network lifetime on the traffic prediction task).

Algebraic approach to recovering topological information in distributed camera networks
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
Camera networks are widely used for tasks such as surveillance, monitoring and tracking. In order to accomplish these tasks, knowledge of localization information such as camera locations and other geometric constraints about the environment (e.g. walls, rooms, and building layout) are typically considered to be essential. However, this information is not required for tasks such as estimating the topology of camera network coverage, or coordinate-free object tracking and navigation. In this paper, we propose a simplicial representation (called CN-Complex) that can be constructed from discrete local observations, and utilize this novel representation to recover topological information of the network coverage. We prove that our representation captures the correct topological information for coverage in 2.5D layouts, and demonstrate its utility in simulations as well as an experimental setup. Our proposed approach is particularly useful in the context of ad-hoc camera networks in indoor/outdoor urban environments with distributed but limited computational power and energy.

Near-optimal Bayesian localization via incoherence and sparsity

2009
This paper exploits recent developments in sparse approximation and compressive sensing to efficiently perform localization in a sensor network. We introduce a Bayesian framework for the localization problem and provide sparse approximations to its optimal solution. By exploiting the spatial sparsity of the posterior density, we demonstrate that the optimal solution can be computed using fast sparse approximation algorithms. We show that exploiting the signal sparsity can reduce the sensing and computational cost on the sensors, as well as the communication bandwidth. We further illustrate that the sparsity of the source locations can be exploited to decentralize the computation of the source locations and reduce the sensor communications even further. We also discuss how recent results in 1-bit compressive sensing can significantly reduce the amount of inter-sensor communications by transmitting only the intrinsic timing information. Finally, we develop a computationally efficient algorithm for bearing estimation using a network of sensors with provable guarantees.

Sensor ranking: A primitive for efficient content-based sensor search
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
The increasing penetration of the real world with embedded and globally networked sensors enables the formation of a Web of Things (WoT), where high-level state information derived from sensors is embedded into Web representations of real-world entities (e.g. places, objects). A key service for the WoT is searching for entities which exhibit a certain dynamic state at the time of the query, which is a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of the sought state information and due to the potentially huge scale of the WoT. In this paper we introduce a primitive called sensor ranking to enable efficient search for sensors that have a certain output state at the time of the query. The key idea is to efficiently compute for each sensor an estimate of the probability that it matches the query and process sensors in the order of decreasing probability, such that effort is first spent on sensors that are very likely to actually match the query. Using real data sets, we show that sensor ranking can significantly improve the efficiency of content-based sensor search.

In this work we present new in-network techniques for communication efficient approximate query processing in wireless sensor nets. We use a model-based approach that constructs and maintains a spanning tree within the network, rooted at the base station. The tree maintains compressed summary information for each link that is used to ldquostub outrdquo traversal during query processing. Our work is based on a formal model of the in-network tree construction task framed as an optimization problem.We demonstrate hardness results for that problem, and develop efficient approximation algorithms for subtasks that are too expensive to compute exactly. We also propose efficient heuristics to accommodate a wider set of workloads, and empirically evaluate their performance and sensitivity to model changes.

Motivated by a peer-to-peer estimation algorithm in which adaptive weights are optimized to minimize the estimation error variance, we formulate and solve a novel nonconvex Lipschitz optimization problem that guarantees global stability of a large class of peer-to-peer consensus-based algorithms for wireless sensor network. Because of packet losses, the solution of this optimization problem cannot be achieved efficiently with either traditional centralized methods or distributed Lagrangian message passing. We prove that the optimal solution can be obtained by solving a set of nonlinear equations. A fast distributed algorithm, which requires only local computations, is presented for solving these equations. Analysis and computer simulations illustrate the algorithm and its application to various network topologies.

We present the architecture, design, and preliminary evaluation of ACme, a wireless sensor and actuator network for monitoring AC energy usage and controlling AC devices in a large and diverse building environment. The ACme system consists of three tiers: the ACme node which provides a metering and control interface to a single outlet, a network fabric which allows this interface to be exported to arbitrary IP endpoints, and application software that uses this networked interface to provide various power-centric applications. The ACme node integrates an Epic core module with a dedicated energy metering IC to provide real, reactive, and apparent power measurements, with optional control of an attached load. The network comprises a complete IPv6/6LoWPAN stack on every node and an edge router that connects to other IP networks. The application tier receives and stores readings in a database and uses a Web server for visualization. Nodes automatically join the IPv6 subnet after being plugged in, and begin interactions with the application layer.

Wireless sensor networks are untethered infrastructures that are easy to deploy and have limited visual impact - a key asset in monitoring heritage buildings of artistic interest. This paper describes one such system deployed in Torre Aquila, a medieval tower in Trento (Italy). Our contributions range from the hardware to the graphical front-end. Customized hardware deals efficiently with high-volume vibration data, and specially-designed sensors acquire the building's deformation. Dedicated software services provide: i) data collection, to efficiently reconcile the diverse data rates and reliability needs of heterogeneous sensors; ii) data dissemination, to spread configuration changes and enable remote tasking; iii) time synchronization, with low memory demands. Unlike most deployments, built directly on the operating system, our entire software layer sits atop our TeenyLIME middleware. Based on 4 months of operation, we show that our system is an effective tool for assessing the tower's stability, as it delivers data reliably (with loss ratios &lt;0.01%) and has an estimated lifetime beyond one year.

Secure-TWS: Authenticating node to multi-user communication in shared sensor networks

2009
Recent works have shown the usefulness of network and application layer protocols that connect low power sensor nodes directly to multiple applications and users on the Internet. We propose a security solution for this scenario. While previous works have provided security support for various communication patterns in sensor networks, such as among nodes, from nodes to a base station, and from users to nodes, the security of communication from sensor nodes to multiple users has not been sufficiently addressed. Specifically, we explore this design space and develop a security solution, named Secure-TWS, for efficient authentication of data sent by a resource constrained sensor node to multiple users, using digital signatures. We investigate the resource overheads in communication and computation for two most suitable signature schemes - the elliptic curve digital algorithm (ECDSA) and the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) short signature schemes. We implement these schemes on two popular sensor node architectures (based on MSP430 and ARM processors with 802.15.4 radios) and experimentally characterize relevant trade-offs.

Anti-jamming for embedded wireless networks
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
Resilience to electromagnetic jamming and its avoidance are difficult problems. It is often both hard to distinguish malicious jamming from congestion in the broadcast regime and a challenge to conceal the activity patterns of the legitimate communication protocol from the jammer. In the context of energy-constrained wireless sensor networks, nodes are scheduled to maximize the common sleep duration and coordinate communication to extend their battery life. This results in well-defined communication patterns with possibly predictable intervals of activity that are easily detected and jammed by a statistical jammer. We present an anti-jamming protocol for sensor networks which eliminates spatio-temporal patterns of communication while maintaining coordinated and contention-free communication across the network. Our protocol, WisperNet, is time-synchronized and uses coordinated temporal randomization for slot schedules and slot durations at the link layer and adapts routes to avoid jammers in the network layer.

SENESCOPE: A design tool for cost optimization of wireless sensor nodes
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
The market of wireless sensor networks is permanently growing due to the declining costs of sensor nodes. This paper presents a new approach for the hardware design of sensor networks based on a multi-criteria cost optimization by means of evolutionary algorithms. During an automated selection procedure of several implementation variants, not only expenditures for development and fabrication are considered, but also additional objectives like time to market or process complexity. A design tool was realized in order to support the development of very cost-efficient sensor networks. The integration of specific cost models allows the designer to identify the appropriate architecture variants and technology options. The verification of the design tool resulted in valuable knowledge about sensor nodes especially for specific application scenarios. A prototype for condition monitoring was designed and discussed regarding options for cost optimization.

Radio interferometric Quasi Doppler bearing estimation
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
The paper introduces a novel technique for the bearing estimation of radio sources that can be used for the precise localization and/or tracking of RF tags such as wireless sensor nodes. It is well known that the bearing to a radio source can be estimated by an array of antennas typically arranged in a circular manner. The method is often referred to as quasi-Doppler measurement. The disadvantage of the existing method is that the receiver is relatively large because of the multiple antennas (typically 8 or 16) and it is computationally intensive to process the high frequency radio signals. Thus, it cannot be done on small, inexpensive radio tags. Instead, we propose to use the array on the transmitter side utilizing as few as three antennas. We use a radio interferometric technique to transform the useful phase information from the high frequency radio signal to a low frequency signal (&lt; 1 kHz) that can be processed on low-cost hardware. Utilizing three anchors nodes with small antenna arrays, any number of low cost wireless nodes with single antennas can be accurately localized.

PDA: Passive distributed assertions for sensor networks
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
Sensor networks are prone to failures and are hard to debug. This is particularly true for failures caused by incorrect interaction of multiple nodes. We propose a mechanism called passive distributed assertions (PDA) that allows developers to detect such failures and provides hints on possible causes. PDA allow a programmer to formulate assertions over distributed node states using a simple declarative language, causing the sensor network to emit information that can be passively collected (e.g., using packet sniffing) and evaluated to verify that assertions hold. This passive approach allows us to minimize the interference between the application and assertion verification. Further, our system provides mechanisms to deal with inaccurate traces that result from message loss and synchronization inaccuracies. We implement PDA on the BTnode platform and evaluate it using an extensive case study.

Enabling large-scale storage in sensor networks with the Coffee file system

Persistent storage offers multiple advantages for sensor networks, yet the available storage systems have been unwieldy because of their complexity and device-specific designs. We present the Coffee file system for flash-based sensor devices. Coffee provides a programming interface for building efficient and portable storage abstractions. Unlike previous flash file systems, Coffee uses a small and constant RAM footprint per file, making it scale elegantly with workloads consisting of large files or many files. In addition, the performance overhead of Coffee is low: the throughput is at least 92% of the achievable direct flash driver throughput. We show that network layer components such as routing tables and packet queues can be implemented on top of Coffee, leading to increased performance and reduced memory requirements for routing and transport protocols.

Poster abstract: Energy management in wireless healthcare systems
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2009
We implemented and analyzed the battery lifetime optimization problem for wireless healthcare systems and showed that task assignment can play a major role in energy management. In the static case, where system parameters are fixed (e.g. processing and communication latency), the assignment of tasks to heterogeneous nodes in the system significantly affects performance and the level of available energy. Since task binding and scheduling problems are NP hard, heuristic algorithms are needed for practical solutions. Furthermore, the overall system characteristics are dynamically changing - the availability of the wireless network and its throughput, battery capacity of various nodes in the system, the user's needs, etc. To address the dynamic aspects of the system and the resource constrained nature of the mobile nodes, we will implement a heuristic algorithm to achieve a longer battery lifetime of the system. We plan to evaluate the performance of the heuristic and compare it against the optimal solutions produced by the ILP.

Poster abstract: Multi-channel interference in wireless sensor networks
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
One solution for increasing the network throughput of a WSN is to use multiple orthogonal channels for transmission instead of a single channel. Multiple transmissions can take place on these orthogonal channels to increase the spectral efficiency. Typical WSN devices are equipped with a single transceiver with channel switching capabilities. These devices provide support for the use of multiple channels operating at different frequencies e.g., CC2420 radios used for MicaZ and Telos motes can use 16 different channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Use of multiple channels in WSN has been explored in previous research efforts and multi channel MAC and routing protocols has been proposed to improve the network throughput. Most of these protocols assume the presence of multiple orthogonal channels for parallel communications. One problem with use of multichannel in WSN is that channels are not truly orthogonal i.e., multiple simultaneous transmissions on adjacent channels do cause interference. Moreover interference caused by external networks e.g., WiFi operating in the same frequency band is also non trivial. It is thus imperative to consider these interference issues at the design stage of a multi channel protocol to avoid performance degradation during operation. We perform a detailed empirical study of these interference issues in multi channel WSN and present guidelines, based on this study, for design of efficient multi channel protocols for WSN.

Poster abstract: Exploiting the LQI variance for rapid channel quality assessment
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2009
Communicating over a reliable radio channel is vital for an efficient resource usage in sensor networks: a bad radio channel can lead to poor application performance and higher energy consumption. Previous research has shown that the LQI mean value is a good estimator of the link quality. Nevertheless, due to its high variance, many packets are needed to obtain a reliable estimation. Based on experimental results, we show instead that the LQI variance is not a limitation. We show that the variance of the LQI can be used as a metric for a rapid channel quality assessment. Our initial results indicate that identifying good channels using the LQI variance requires an order of magnitude fewer packets than when using the mean LQI.

In long-term deployments of sensor networks, monitoring the quality of gathered data is a critical issue. Over the time of deployment, sensors are exposed to harsh conditions, causing some of them to fail or to deliver less accurate data. If such a degradation remains undetected, the usefulness of a sensor network can be greatly reduced. We present an approach that learns spatio-temporal correlations between different sensors, and makes use of the learned model to detect misbehaving sensors by using distributed computation and only local communication between nodes. We introduce SODESN, a distributed recurrent neural network architecture, and a learning method to train SODESN for fault detection in a distributed scenario. Our approach is evaluated using data from different types of sensors and is able to work well even with less-than-perfect link qualities and more than 50% of failed nodes.

Spatial skyline queries can be used in wireless sensor networks for collaborative positioning of multiple objects. However, designing a distributed spatial skyline algorithm in resource constrained wireless environments introduces several research challenges: how to combine multi-dimensional data, (e.g. distances to multiple events) to compute the skylines efficiently, accurately, quickly, progressively, and concurrently while dealing with the network and event dynamics. We address this challenge by designing distributed spatial skyline (DSS) algorithm. DSS is the first distributed algorithm to compute spatial skylines. In a network of 554 nodes, DSS reduces the communication overhead by up to 91% over a centralized algorithm with 100% accuracy.

The setup of and processing within sensor networks often requires sophisticated and specialized system designs and implementations, but the service provided by them should be as accessible and repurposable as possible. If the increasing number of available sensor-based data sources can be accessed in a simple and universal way, the network effect of aggregating, filtering, and republishing data from these sources will significantly increase their value. We propose an architecture where sensor-based data sources publish their data based on feeds, but extended with query capabilities. Using the well-known and widely supported Atom feed format and extending it with query capabilities allows us to lower the barrier-of-entry to sensor-based data sources, opening this data to a wider audience of clients.

Image transmission in biomedical wireless sensor networks often requires low complexity, low power consumption with soft real-time constraint. However, the full separation of source coding and channel coding usually comes with large delay and/or complexity. To address these requirements, we propose a new direct mapping of source sample to channel sample that utilizes large bandwidth of ultra wideband (UWB). Our system combines a 5/3 integer lifting scheme wavelet transform followed by a pulse position modulation (PPM). The system's major advantages are low complexity, low power consumption, low processing delay and robustness to error at sensor node. Evaluation on an image transmission system over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel shows that our proposed system can achieve lossless or near lossless image with significant energy saving and very low delay.

With more and more real applications of WSNs have been deployed, which are in charge of either monitoring parameters or event detection, we envision that the success of the WSNs is decided by the quality of the collected data. Further more, the quality of the collected data is mainly affected by the deceptive data, which includes redundant data, very similar repeated readings that provide less information, and false data, wrong readings resulted from unreliable components or wireless communication and malicious attacks. On one hand, redundant data should be filtered because less information is provided but considerable resources are wasted. On the other hand, false data should also be filtered to improve data accuracy. Thus, we are targeting to detect and filter the deceptive data in high-dynamic event-driven WSNs from the data itself point of view by proposing a role-based deceptive detection and filtering (RDIcircplusmn) mechanism in this paper.

RACNet is a sensor network that monitors a data center's environmental conditions at high temporal and spatial resolutions. The data RACNet collects can improve the energy efficiency of data centers, currently one of the fastest growing energy consumers in the U.S. RACNet overcomes the challenge of reliable and low-latency data gathering from dense networks deployed in harsh RF environments through rDCP, a novel network protocol that decouples data collection from topology control. Furthermore, rDCP automatically partitions the network to multiple routing trees, each operating at a different frequency channel. The combination of these features enables rDCP to scale up while maintaining high data yields. Preliminary results from a production deployment of 694 sensors (including 174 wireless nodes) show that rDCP achieves a data yield of 99%, while delivering 90% of the measurements in less than 30 seconds.

2009
Packet loss and energy consumption in sensor networks depend critically on the quality of the network's wireless links. In turn, link quality depends on the environment in which the RF signals propagate and the locations of the link's endpoints. Experimental results have shown that a low-power wireless link can be in one of three states or dasiaregionspsila, as the inter-node distance increases: connected, transitional (gray), and disconnected. The gray region is characterized by extreme variability, whereby small differences in distance or end-point locations can lead to pronounced differences in loss rates. However, not all is lost. This work investigates the spatial characteristics of the gray region and experimentally shows that one can efficiently identify links with low loss rates within the radio's gray region. One of the possible applications of this finding is in the design of sparse, yet low-loss network deployments.

The factory of the future is the wireless factory-fully programmable, nimble and adaptive to planned mode changes and unplanned faults. Today automotive assembly lines loose over $22,000 per minute of downtime. The systems are rigid, difficult to maintain, operate and diagnose. Our goal is to demonstrate the initial architecture and protocols for all-wireless factory control automation. Embedded wireless networks have largely focused on open-loop sensing and monitoring. To address actuation in closed-loop wireless control systems there is a strong need to re-think the communication architectures and protocols for reliability, coordination and control. As the links, nodes and topology of wireless systems are inherently unreliable, such time-critical and safety-critical applications require programming abstractions where the tasks are assigned to the sensors, actuators and controllers as a single component rather than statically mapping a set of tasks to a specific physical node at design time. To this end, we introduce the embedded virtual machine (EVM), a powerful and flexible runtime system where virtual components and their properties are maintained across node boundaries.

Demo abstract: The Sensor Andrew infrastructure for large-scale campus-wide sensing and actuation
2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2009
We demonstrate sensor Andrew, an infrastructure for Internet-scale sensing and actuation across a wide range of heterogeneous devices. The goal of sensor Andrew is to enable a variety of ubiquitous large-scale monitoring and control applications in a way that is extensible, easy to use, and secure while maintaining privacy. The core architecture is built around the eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) where transducers are modeled as event nodes in a push-based publish-subscribe architecture. Sensor Andrew allows for easy integration of new sensors as well as support for legacy systems. A data handler provides registration, discovery and data logging facilities for each device. The major elements of this architecture have been deployed in five buildings at Carnegie Mellon University, and are comprised of over 1000 sensing points reporting data from multiple communication interfaces. Our demonstration will showcase already active sensor systems on campus using sensor Andrew through a Web interface as well as the ability to locally configure sensor and actuator interactions as an example of how larger-scale applications could be built.

Long-term fine-grained continuous tracking is still not feasible with today's algorithms and protocols. There are two main obstacles. The first is the need for efficient, low-power communication protocols. Many current protocols employ energy-expensive methods to achieve reliable communication for arbitrary traffic situations. The second challenge is the lack of a robust presence detection algorithm that differentiates between ambient packet loss and packet loss due to missing items. We will demonstrate a continuous tracking system using a simple communication protocol, Uni-HB, with the detection algorithms that we designed to yield low false alarm rates while achieving timely loss notification.

ldquoParticipatory sensingrdquo is an exciting new paradigm where people voluntarily sense their local environment and share this data using mobile phones and the Internet. It can revolutionize applications such as intelligent transportation, public health and social networking. However, a major concern is the amount of trust that can be placed in the shared data. We address this concern in our demonstration by using a trusted platform module (TPM) in conjunction with a smart phone. The TPM is responsible for attesting the application on the phone to assure remote entities that the application has not been tampered with. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of application attestation on a smart phone employing a TPM.

Wireless sensor network applications (WSNs) are starting to enter into our daily life. Discovering sensor nodes and the services hosted by them is imperative to any large scale and flexible sensor network application. The heterogeneity and dynamics of wireless sensor networks and their applications are challenges for service discovery protocols. In this demonstration, we present a light-weight service discovery protocol (nanoSD) and its integration into a health care application with heterogeneous network architecture. NanoSD is a sensor network specific service discovery protocol that is specifically designed to be scalable and meet real WSN deployment challenges. Furthermore, it can easily be integrated with Web-service based backend systems with very minimal resource costs.

In sensor networks, it is useful for developers to simulate applications before actual deployment. In this paper, we report a high-fidelity instruction-level sensor network simulator using an accurate CC2420 model. This simulator is independent of the target node's operating system and it supports MICAz motes which contain Atmega128 and CC2420. Besides its cycle-accurate processor emulation, the CC2420's internal operations are accurately modeled so that our simulator shows realistic wireless communication timing during the simulation. In addition, our simulator shows power consumption of each sensor node. Using this simulator, researchers can accurately verify the sensor network's behavior and power consumption without actual hardware deployment.

Wireless networks have highly dynamic and complex behavior. Because there are huge differences between real networks and simplified simulation models, testbed evaluations are key parts of many experimental methodologies. Testbeds, however, have wildly varying properties and behavior, such that experiments on two testbeds can report contradictory results. This poster describes SWAT, a tool for generating reports on the dynamics and properties of wireless networks. Being able to quantify and report key properties of wireless networks sheds light on protocol design choices while simultaneously improving the repeatability and scientific rigor of testbed experiments.

Sensor networks for the detection and tracking of radiation and other threats in cities
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2011
This paper presents results from experiments, mathematical analysis, and simulations of a network of static and mobile sensors for detecting threats on city streets and in open areas such as parks. The paper focuses on the detection of nuclear radiation threats and shows how the analysis can be extended to other classes of threat. The paper evaluates algorithms that integrate methods of parametric and Bayesian statistics. A pure Bayesian approach is difficult because obtaining prior distributions on the large number of parameters is challenging. The results of analyses and simulations are compared against measurements made on a reduced scale testbed. A survey of background radiation in the city of Sacramento is used to quantify the efficacy of police patrols to detect threats. The paper also presents algorithms that optimize network parameters such as sensor placement.

Can cell phones be used to detect earthquakes? The Community Seismic Network (CSN) is building a dense sensor network from inexpensive and community owned sensors, such as cell phones and USB accelerometers. Detecting rare events such as earthquakes is a difficult sensing problem, and is compounded by the wide variations among sensors in a heterogeneous community network. We demonstrate an end-to-end system using Android cell phones and a cloud fusion center that allows participants to create &#x201C;mock earthquakes&#x201D;.

Overcomplete Radon bases for target property management in sensor networks
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
This paper presents a scalable algorithm for managing property information about moving objects tracked by a sensor network. Property information is obtained via distributed sensor observations, but will be corrupted when objects mix up with each other. The association between properties and objects then becomes ambiguous. We build a novel representation framework, exploiting an overcomplete Radon basis dictionary to model property uncertainty in such circumstances. By making use of the combinatorial structure of the basis design and sparse representations we can efficiently approximate the underlying probability distribution of the association between target properties and tracks, overcoming the exponential space that would otherwise be required. We conduct comparative simulations and the results validate the effectiveness of our approach.

WiFlock: Collaborative group discovery and maintenance in mobile sensor networks
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
Low energy neighbor discovery, group formation, and group maintenance is a fundamental service in mobile sensor networks. Traditional solutions consider these protocols separately. In this paper, we introduce WiFlock, an energy-efficient protocol that combines discovery and maintenance using a collaborative beaconing mechanism. WiFlock combines a coordinated synchronized listening and evenly-spaced transmission (SLEST) schedule effectively with oneway discovery beacons to fulfill both purposes. We show that shorter listening duration implies smaller discovery latency and faster group information propagation. Using a novel carrier sensing technique, we achieve a fast wakeup and listen duration of 80μs on a low-power radio. With this listening duration, we evaluate WiFlock on a 50-node test bed with nodes running at 0.2% duty cycles. We show that WiFlock has shorter discovery latency and better scalability than previous approaches.

Exploration of path space using sensor network geometry
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2011
In a sensor network there are many paths between a source and a destination. An efficient method to explore and navigate in the `path space' can help many important routing primitives, in particular, multipath routing and resilient routing (when nodes or links can fail unexpectedly) as considered in this paper. Both problems are challenging for a general graph setting, especially if each node cannot afford to have the global knowledge. In this paper we use a geometric approach to allow efficient exploration of the path space with very little overhead. We are motivated by the recent development on regulating a sensor network geometry using conformal mapping, in which any sensor network can be embedded to be circular (and any possible hole is made circular as well) and greedy routing guarantees delivery. In this paper we explore the freedom of a Mo&#x0308;bius transformation inherent to this conformal mapping. By applying a Mo&#x0308;bius transformation we can get an alternative embedding with the same property such that greedy routing generates a different path. We present distributed algorithms using local information and limited global information (the positions and sizes of the holes) to generate disjoint multi-paths for a given source destination pair or switch to a different path `on the fly' when transmission failure is encountered. The overhead of applying a Mo&#x0308;bius transformation simply boils down to four parameters that could be carried by a packet or determined at need at the source. Demonstrated by simulation results, this method compares favorably in terms of performance and cost metrics with centralized solutions of using flow algorithms or random walk based decentralized solutions in generating alternative paths.

Probabilistic addressing: Stable addresses in unstable wireless networks

2011
Unreliable connectivity and rapidly changing link qualities make it challenging to establish stable addressing in wireless networks. This is especially difficult in communication scenarios where nodes determine their own addresses based on the underlying connectivity in the network. In this paper, we present Probabilistic ADdressing (PAD), a virtual coordinate based addressing mechanism that efficiently deals with dynamic communication links in wireless networks. It assigns probabilistic addresses to nodes without needing to pessimistically estimate links over longer periods of time. The routing metric predicts the current location of a node in its address distribution. Our prototype implementation over real testbeds compares PAD with Beacon Vector Routing (BVR), a prominent routing approach in sensornets, and S4, a cluster based extension of BVR and state-of-the-art in point-to-point routing in sensornets. Our results from three widely used testbeds indicate that PAD achieves 3-7 times more stable addressing than BVR, and minimizes the number of transmissions in the network by 26% when compared with S4 under challenging networking conditions.

Efficient network flooding and time synchronization with Glossy
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2011
This paper presents Glossy, a novel flooding architecture for wireless sensor networks. Glossy exploits constructive interference of IEEE 802.15.4 symbols for fast network flooding and implicit time synchronization. We derive a timing requirement to make concurrent transmissions of the same packet interfere constructively, allowing a receiver to decode the packet even in the absence of capture effects. To satisfy this requirement, our design temporally decouples flooding from other network activities. We analyze Glossy using a mixture of statistical and worst-case models, and evaluate it through experiments under controlled settings and on three wireless sensor testbeds. Our results show that Glossy floods packets within a few milliseconds and achieves an average time synchronization error below one microsecond. In most cases, a node receives the flooding packet with a probability higher than 99.99%, while having its radio turned on for only a few milliseconds during a flood. Moreover, unlike existing flooding schemes, Glossy's performance exhibits no noticeable dependency on node density, which facilitates its application in diverse real-world settings.

In-pavement wireless sensor network for vehicle classification

Vehicle classification data, especially for trucks, is of considerable use to agencies involved in almost all aspects of transportation and pavement engineering. Current technologies for classification involve expensive installation and calibration procedures. A wireless sensor network (WSN) for vehicle classification based on axle count and spacing was designed, calibrated, tested, and deployed near a weigh station in Sunol, California. The WSN includes: vibration sensors which report pavement acceleration; vehicle detection sensors which report vehicle's time of arrival and departure; and an Access Point (AP) that logs the data collected from all these sensors. Both sensors are packaged for durability, occupy minimal space, have long lifetimes, and are embedded inside the pavement. The vibration sensors are capable of over-the-air software programming and are designed to be immune to sound. Vibration and classification ground truth data for 53 different trucks exiting the weigh station were collected. The vibration data collected at 512 Hz had an accuracy of 400 μg. A novel algorithm for estimating axle count and spacing has been developed. The combination of bandwidth-aware smoothing filter and peak detector that we use in this algorithm could be useful in many other applications. The algorithm successfully classified all 53 trucks.

Continuous inference of psychological stress from sensory measurements collected in the natural environment
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2011
Repeated exposures to psychological stress can lead to or worsen diseases of slow accumulation such as heart diseases and cancer. The main challenge in addressing the growing epidemic of stress is a lack of robust methods to measure a person's exposure to stress in the natural environment. Periodic self-reports collect only subjective aspects, often miss stress episodes, and impose significant burden on subjects. Physiological sensors provide objective and continuous measures of stress response, but exhibit wide between-person differences and are easily confounded by daily activities (e.g., speaking, physical movements, coffee intake, etc.). In this paper, we propose, train, and test two models for continuous prediction of stress from physiological measurements captured by unobtrusive, wearable sensors. The first model is a physiological classifier that predicts whether changes in physiology represent stress. Since the effect of stress may persist in the mind longer than its acute effect on physiology, we propose a perceived stress model to predict perception of stress. It uses the output of the physiological classifier to model the accumulation and gradual decay of stress in the mind. To account for wide between-person differences, both models self-calibrate to each subject. Both models were trained using data collected from 21 subjects in a lab study, where they were exposed to cognitive, physical, and social stressors representative of that experienced in the natural environment. Our physiological classifier achieves 90% accuracy and our perceived stress model achieves a median correlation of 0.72 with self-reported rating. We also evaluate the perceived stress model on data collected from 17 participants in a two-day field study, and find that the average rating of stress obtained from our model has a correlation of 0.71 with that obtained from periodic self-reports.

In recent years, research of sensor networks has advanced rapidly. Sensor networks are anticipated for use in widely various fields such as product traceability systems, environmental monitoring, and health care. However, developers must develop applications to work in a sensor node and applications to produce sensor data. The knowledge that is necessary for development and acquisition of the programming language is both costly and time-consuming to develop. This study examines the possibility of web programmers becoming independent of specific programming languages. Software libraries can be developed easily for sensor nodes, and development of server applications can become possible using a new system. In addition, we produced a visualization application experimentally using geographic information using the server application and a developed software library.

EcoCast is an execution framework for macroprogramming of wireless sensor networks. Users access sensor nodes as dynamic objects in Python without being concerned with network protocols or data types. EcoCast extends Python's functional programming primitives map(), reduce(), and filter() to macroprogramming at native speed by patching the firmware transparently without rebooting, and without requiring most users to write code in C or assembly. This demo shows the use of EcoCast batch commands on wireless light controllers, which are composed of EcoSpire nodes connected to relay switches. Starting from only EcoCast firmware, we show incremental code generation and firmware patching, by loading necessary sensor drivers on demand. The composition of sensing value checking and light-switch actions shows how the firmware can be customized and programmed as a result of such an interactive session without writing a single line of C code.

We demonstrate a distributed scheme for control over wireless networks. In our previous work, we introduced the concept of a Wireless Control Network (WCN), where the network itself, with no centralized node, acts as the controller. In this demonstration, we show how the WCN can be utilized for distillation column control, a well-known process control problem. To illustrate the use of a WCN, we have utilized a process-in-the-loop simulation, where the behavior of a distillation column was simulated in Simulink and interfaced with an actual, physical network (used as the control network), which consists of several wireless nodes, sensors and actuators. The goal of this demonstration is to show the benefits of a fully-distributed robust wireless control/actuator network, which include simple scheduling, scalability and compositionality.

Demo abstract: Closed-loop testing for implantable cardiac pacemakers
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
The increasing complexity of software in implantable medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators accounts for over 40% of device recalls. Testing remains the principal means of verification in the medical device certification regime. Traditional software test generation techniques, where the tests are generated independently of the operational environment, are not effective as the device must be tested within the context of the patient's condition and the current state of the heart. It is necessary for the testing system to observe the system state and adaptively generate the next input to advance the purpose of the test. To this effect, a set of general and patient condition-specific temporal requirements is specified for the closed-loop heart and pacemaker system. Based on these requirements, we implemented a closed-loop testing platform between a timed automata based heart model on a FPGA board and a pacemaker on a micro-controller. This allows for interactive and physiologically relevant model-based test generation for basic pacemaker device operations such as maintaining the heart rate and atrial-ventricle synchrony. We also demonstrate the flexibility and efficacy of the testing platform for more complex common timing anomalies such as reentry circuits, pacemaker mode switch operation and pacemaker-mediated tachycardia. This system is a step toward a testing approach for medical cyber-physical systems with the patient-in-the-loop.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become a viable platform for surveillance and exploration tasks. Several commercial quadrotor aircraft have been successfully used as surveillance equipment with groups such as United States and Canadian police forces, and additional applications for this technology could include exploration of ra-dioactive/hazmat environments, naval search and rescue, or surveying a building on fire, to name a few. Despite the agility and speed of the quadrotor platform, current systems lack the redundancy and collaboration of a multi-unit team; current implementations of quadrotor UAV flocks require expensive equipment, limiting the system to operation within range of external sensors. We propose a system for intelligently controlling multiple quadrotor UAVs using a combination of on-board vision tracking and wireless communication of attitude measurements. The proposed system uses a lead, human-controlled quadrotor and one or more quadro-tors that track and follow the lead unit autonomously. The forthcoming system aims to improve the execution time required to complete missions and increase both breadth of search and platform effectiveness.

EnRoute: An energy router for energy-efficient buildings
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
The US Department of Energy estimates that 73% of electricity usage is consumed by buildings. The Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for almost 50% of the total energy budget. Demand-based pricing for commercial buildings makes it necessary for them to reduce power consumption during peak hours, when electricity is priced at a higher rate. Peaks in electricity demand occur when multiple systems are simultaneously consuming electricity. In this paper, we look at the problem of energy load management for commercial buildings and propose En-Route, a wireless Energy Router platform for control and scheduling of energy delivery to minimize peak electricity consumed by buildings. We have built a scaled model of a building, which generates HVAC dynamics that match an actual building. The Energy Router monitors the temperature, humidity and power consumption in different zones of the building in real-time. It then runs an &#x201C;energy aware&#x201D; algorithm that schedules HVAC systems based on the operating conditions of each zone to minimize the peak power consumption of the building.

DustDoctor: A self-healing sensor data collection system
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2011
This demonstration presents a tool, called DustDoctor, for troubleshooting sensor data fusion systems in which data is combined from multiple heterogeneous sources to compute actionable information. Application examples include target detection, critical infrastructure monitoring, and participatory sensing. In such systems, the correctness of end results may become compromised for a variety of possible reasons, such as node malfunction, bugs, environmental conditions unfavorable to certain sensors, or assumption mismatches (such as use of incompatible units on different nodes of the same distributed computation). DustDoctor adapts algorithms borrowed from previous discriminative mining literature to analyze data fusion flow graphs, called provenance graphs, and isolate sources and conditions correlated with anomalous results. This information is subsequently used to isolate malfunctioning components or filter out erroneous reports. We demonstrate our approach on MicaZ motes, running a simple data collection application, where users are allowed to inject a variety of different emulated faults, leaving it to DustDoctor to find and isolate them to prevent contamination of fusion results.

Apollo: Towards factfinding in participatory sensing
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
This demonstration presents Apollo, a new sensor information processing tool for uncovering likely facts in noisy participatory sensing data. Participatory sensing, where users proactively document and share their observations, has received significant attention in recent years as a paradigm for crowd-sourcing observation tasks. However, it poses interesting challenges in assessing confidence in the information received. By borrowing clustering and ranking tools from data mining literature, we show how to group data into sets (or claims), corroborating specific events or observations, then iteratively assess both claim and source credibility, ultimately leading to a ranking of described claims by their like-lihoold of occurrence. Apollo belongs to a category of tools called fact-finders. It is the first fact-finder designed and implemented specifically for participatory sensing. Apollo uses Twitter as the underlying engine for sharing participatory sensing data. Twitter is widely popular, can be interfaced to cell-phones that share sensor data, and comes with a powerful search API, as well as a publish-subscribe mechanism. We evaluate it using a participatory sensing application that collects and posts noisy vehicular traffic data on Twitter, as well as a set of 60,000 (human) tweets collected during the Haiti tsunami and a set of 500,000 tweets collected about Cairo during its recent unrest. Viewers of the demonstration will interact with Apollo for various fact-finding tasks.

Demo abstract: AutoPlug &#x2014; An automotive test-bed for ECU testing, validation and verification

2011
In 2010, over 20.3 million vehicles were recalled. Software issues related to automotive controls such as to cruise control, anti-lock braking system, traction control and stability control, account for an increasingly large percentage of the overall vehicles recalled. We have developed AutoPlug, an automotive Electronic Controller Unit (ECU) test-bed to diagnose, test, validate and verify controls software. AutoPlug consists of multiple ECUs interconnected by a CAN bus, a race car driving simulator which behaves as the plant model and a vehicle safety and performance monitor in Matlab. As the ECUs drive the simulated vehicle, the physics-based simulation provides feedback to the controllers in terms of acceleration, yaw, friction and vehicle stability. This closed-loop platform is then used to evaluate multiple vehicle control software modules such as traction, stability and cruise control. With this test-bed we are aim to develop ECU software diagnosis and testing to evaluate the effect on the stability and performance of the vehicle. Code updates can be executed via a smart phone so drivers may remotely &#x201C;patch&#x201D; their vehicle. We will demonstrate a functioning closed-loop automotive test-bed to show the capabilities and challenges of remote code updates for vehicle recalls management.

EcoIMU is a gyro-free, wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) built with a pair of triaxial accelerometers that are spatially separated and wirelessly connected. It can output the translation and rotation of the body for the purpose of motion tracking and dead reckoning applications. It mitigates error accumulation and drift problems using domain knowledge including pause identification and geometric constraints on the two nodes.

PhotoNet: A similarity-aware image delivery service for situation awareness
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
This demonstration illustrates PhotoNet, an image delivery service for mobile camera networks. PhotoNet is motivated by the needs of disaster-response applications, where a group of survivors and first responders may survey damage and send images to a rescue center in the absence of a functional communication infrastructure. The protocol runs on mobile devices, handling opportunistic forwarding (when they come in contact) and in-network storage. It assigns priorities to images for forwarding and replacement depending on the degree of similarity (or dissimilarity) among them. Prioritization aims at reducing semantic redundancy such as that between pictures of the same scene taken from slightly different angles. This is in contrast to redundancy among identical objects and among time series data. We evaluate PhotoNet in an emulated disaster recovery scenario, with a predetermined set of problem locales that need attention. Humans with camera phones form a mobible camera sensor network. Not all pictures make it to the rescue center because of resource constraints. At the rescue center, the utility of the camera network is measured by the number of problem locales of which the center becomes aware as a function of time. A better network delivers awareness of more trouble locales sooner. We show that, in resource constrained networks, reducing semantic redundancy can significantly improve utility. Users of the demo will be allowed to interact with both a simulator and a small set of mobile phones to understand the impact of network and protocol parameters on situation awareness.

Demo abstract: Online detection of speaking from respiratory measurements collected in the natural environment
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2011
We present a novel method to detect when a person is speaking using respiratory measurements collected in the natural environment. A speaker's respiration pattern is sampled from a respiratory inductive plethysmograph (RIP) band worn around the speaker's chest. Ratio of inhalation duration to exhalation duration (IE ratio) has traditionally been used to detect speaking in controlled lab environment [7]. However, we find that IE ratio is inadequate in the natural environment. We propose several new features to be used along with IE ratio. Using various statistics over these features, we obtain &gt;;95% accuracy in classifying respiration measurements into &#x201C;speaking&#x201D; or &#x201C;silence&#x201D; states with 10-fold cross validation. Our demonstration will show realtime capture of the respiration signal, computation of features, and detection of speaking and silence, all on a mobile smartphone.

Developing applications and protocols for wireless sensor networks is a time consuming and error prone task, which possibly includes many iterations of implementation and testing. While simulations will probably not replace testbed experiments completely, they are a time efficient tool for rapid prototyping of sensor networks. Writing code and testing an application is often done using a different set of tools, e.g., a text editor and a simulation tool. To bridge the gap between development and simulation, we demonstrate the advantages of a seamless interconnection between YETI, a feature-rich development environment for TinyOS, and COOJA, a simulator for wireless sensor networks.

Run-time debugging tools are required to detect and diagnose post-deployment failures in wireless sensor networks. Reproducing a failure from the trace of past events can play a crucial role in diagnosis. We describe TinyTracer, an efficient interprocedural control-flow tracing tool that generates the trace of all interleaving concurrent events as well as the control-flow paths taken. TinyTracer enables reproducing failures at a later stage, allowing the programmer to diagnose failures effectively. In this demo, we demonstrate the ease of use of TinyTracer. We see TinyTracer as an important tool for post-deployment diagnosis, which can enable future research on trace-based debugging approaches for wireless sensor networks.

We evaluate our ideas on the TinyNode platform showing a notable reduction of transmission energy and channel access without requiring significant usage of additional resources such as memory.

Design and development of wireless sensor network applications adds an additional layer of complexity to traditional computer systems. The developer needs to be an expert in resource constrained embedded devices as well as traditional desktop computers.

Users build applications using a drag-and-drop visual programming language Open Blocks, a language that Google selected for its App Inventor for Android. Tinylnventor uses cross-platform programming concepts, such as threads and common network operations, to provide a unified environment from which it generates application binaries for the respective platforms. We demonstrate through an application example that Tinylnventor is both simple to use and powerful in expressing complex applications.

Geophysical inspection methods are used in many fields to evaluate the integrity of earthen structures (e.g., earth dams, underground tunnels) without drilling or boring. Traditional geophysical surveys are completed manually and, thus, are time consuming, laborious, and expensive; these facts result in infrequent geophysical inspection, which decreases the overall effectiveness of the monitoring goals. Our contribution enables cost effective and continuous geophysical monitoring through the development of a new wireless hardware platform for geophysical measurements. In this work, we present our design specifications and requirements of gsMote, our wireless geophysical hardware platform. We use earth dam management to motivate the development of gsMote. Additionally, we discuss how our gsMote platform enables other geophysical monitoring applications, such as bioremediation.

Power watermarking: Facilitating power-based diagnosis of node silence in remote high-end sensing systems

Our prior work suggested the use of power traces of unresponsive sensor nodes to diagnose the cause of anomalous node silence, but suffers from its limitations in scalability. To address these issues, we propose a new concept of power watermarking, a diagnostic service that actively produces unique power watermarks for each system state of interest so as to convey system information over power measurements. Failures of applications, hardware, or the watermark generator result in different watermark combinations or absence thereof. Experiments demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy and energy efficiency, even in the presence of multiple applications of similar natural power consumption patterns.

Poster abstract: A congestion mitigation approach using mobile nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
When an event occurs in an area observed by a Wireless Sensor Network, a vast amount of information is transferred towards the sink(s) of the network. This phenomenon may sometimes result into network congestion and as a consequence packets may start dropping due to queue overflows. To our knowledge most proposed reactions to this phenomenon utilize only static nodes whereas a few utilize mobile sink(s). Our approach is focusing on using multiple mobile nodes to build Hard Alternate Disjoint Paths between some of the sources of the congested nodes and the sink(s) to mitigate congestion. Mobile Congestion Control (Mobile-CC) algorithm is applicable in areas where congestion happens repeatedly, or is of high duration or even permanent. If congestion happens for a very small period of time there will be no big benefit (in terms of congestion mitigation) when moving any nodes to that area, unless there is great probability of the event happening again at the same place.

Modeling an electronically switchable directional antenna for low-power wireless networks

2011
We present an empirical link-layer model of an electronically switch-able directional antenna for low-power wireless networks. By virtue of directed transmissions, such antennas alleviate wireless contention and increase the communication range at no additional energy cost. In addition, the ability to dynamically change the direction of maximum gain allows to steer the radiated power in different directions on a per-packet basis. However, the few protocols that leverage such features are usually based on abstract antenna models, and are thus of limited applicability. On the contrary, we base our model on extensive real-world experiments using an existing antenna prototype we built. Our model mimics the temporal variations caused by environmental dynamics. We are currently embedding our model in the Cooja simulator, enabling the investigation of protocols leveraging this antenna technology in networks of arbitrary size.

Monitoring the impact of sleep deprivation on thermoregulation requires a careful measurement of skin temperature across the human body to have precise knowledge and understanding of the stability of circadian rhythms, the 24-hour cycles of biological activity. However, medical measurements and clinical trials are often carried out in controlled lab settings, which limits the realism and the duration of data collections, and increases significantly their costs. We aim to provide medical researchers studying the stability of the circadian rhythms with a tool for higher quality data collections. We design and develop a wireless unobtrusive monitoring system for accurate body temperature measurements to be worn by patients for several weeks while they live their normal life. Obtaining a long-lasting highly-accurate measurement system is challenging, as energy and computational resources are severely constrained in miniaturized wearable sensor nodes. We develop a prototype of an active temperature measurement system with 0.02&#x00B0;C accuracy, a lifetime of up to 3 weeks, and real-time feedback to a remote medic. Our preliminary experiments show that we can identify the circadian rhythms also in non-ambulatory environments, indicating that our tool could become a valuable asset for medical research.

2011
When we try to use a sensor network outdoors, for purposes such as collecting information related to large-scale natural disasters and agricultural applications, it often happens that the communication distance is insufficient. Many sensor network users in Japan utilize sensor nodes that use 2.4 GHz frequency. The communication distance of these sensor nodes is short (a few hundred meters). Therefore, to achieve long-distance communication, sensor network users need relay nodes. However, these relay nodes might cause an increase in cost, complexity, and needs for maintenance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose long-distance communication nodes. It is realized in the application of long-distance communication technology developed by Mathematical Assist Design Laboratory[1]. This technology is necessary to use PC(Large and high power consumption) for the decipherment because this technology demands a lot of resources. So, we solve the problem of size and power consumption using DSP.

JamLab: Augmenting sensornet testbeds with realistic and controlled interference generation
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
Radio interference drastically affects the performance of sensor-net communications, leading to packet loss and reduced energy-efficiency. As an increasing number of wireless devices operates on the same ISM frequencies, there is a strong need for understanding and debugging the performance of existing sensornet protocols under interference. Doing so requires a low-cost flexible testbed infrastructure that allows the repeatable generation of a wide range of interference patterns. Unfortunately, to date, existing sensornet testbeds lack such capabilities, and do not permit to study easily the coexistence problems between devices sharing the same frequencies. This paper addresses the current lack of such an infrastructure by using off-the-shelf sensor motes to record and playback interference patterns as well as to generate customizable and repeat-able interference in real-time. We propose and develop JamLab: a low-cost infrastructure to augment existing sensornet testbeds with accurate interference generation while limiting the overhead to a simple upload of the appropriate software. We explain how we tackle the hardware limitations and get an accurate measurement and regeneration of interference, and we experimentally evaluate the accuracy of JamLab with respect to time, space, and intensity. We further use JamLab to characterize the impact of interference on sensornet MAC protocols.

Is there light at the ends of the tunnel? Wireless sensor networks for adaptive lighting in road tunnels
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2011
Existing deployments of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are often conceived as stand-alone monitoring tools. In this paper, we report instead on a deployment where the WSN is a key component of a closed-loop control system for adaptive lighting in operational road tunnels. WSN nodes along the tunnel walls report light readings to a control station, which closes the loop by setting the intensity of lamps to match a legislated curve. The ability to match dynamically the lighting levels to the actual environmental conditions improves the tunnel safety and reduces its power consumption. The use of WSNs in a closed-loop system, combined with the real-world, harsh setting of operational road tunnels, induces tighter requirements on the quality and timeliness of sensed data, as well as on the reliability and lifetime of the network. In this work, we test to what extent mainstream WSN technology meets these challenges, using a dedicated design that however relies on well-established techniques. The paper describes the hw/sw architecture we devised by focusing on the WSN component, and analyzes its performance through experiments in a real, operational tunnel.

The use of wireless devices with accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure the movements of humans and objects is a growing area of interest. Applications range from simple activity detection to detailed full-body motion capture using networks of sensors worn on the body. A variety of algorithms have been proposed for these applications, but opportunities for accurate evaluation and comparison have been limited due to the many difficulties with performing rigorous experiments. We present a simulation environment, specifically for inertial sensing applications, designed to tackle this problem. We simulate sensor readings based on continuous trajectory models, and show how suitable models can be generated from existing motion capture or other sampled data. We show a good match between our simulated data and real sensor data for human movements. We also model a wide range of real-world issues such as non-ideal sensors, magnetic field distortions, timing factors and radio packet losses. To demonstrate the capabilities of our simulator, we present new results comparing four existing orientation estimation algorithms for human motion capture.

SpiderBat: Augmenting wireless sensor networks with distance and angle information

2011
Having access to accurate position information is a key requirement for many wireless sensor network applications. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of SpiderBat, an ultrasound-based ranging platform designed to augment existing sensor nodes with distance and angle information. SpiderBat features independently controllable ultrasound transmitters and receivers, in all directions of the compass. Using a digital compass, nodes can learn about their orientation, and combine this information with distance and angle measurements using ultrasound. To the best of our knowledge, SpiderBat is the first ultrasound-based sensor node platform that can measure absolute angles between sensor nodes accurately. The availability of angle information enables us to estimate node positions with a precision in the order of a few centimeters. Moreover, our system allows to position nodes in multi-hop networks where pure distance-based algorithms must fail, in particular in sparse networks, with only a single anchor node. Furthermore, information on absolute node orientations makes it possible to detect whether two nodes are in line-of-sight. Consequently, we can detect the presence of obstacles and walls by looking at patterns in the received ultrasound signal.

SensorFly: Controlled-mobile sensing platform for indoor emergency response applications
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
Indoor emergency response situations, such as urban fire, are characterized by dangerous constantly-changing operating environments with little access to situational information for first responders. In-situ information about the conditions, such as the extent and evolution of an indoor fire, can augment rescue efforts and reduce risk to emergency personnel. Static sensor networks that are pre-deployed or manually deployed have been proposed, but are less practical due to need for large infrastructure, lack of adaptivity and limited coverage. Controlled-mobility in sensor networks, i.e. the capability of nodes to move as per network needs can provide the desired autonomy to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we present SensorFly, a controlled-mobile aerial sensor network platform for indoor emergency response application. The miniature, low-cost sensor platform has capabilities to self deploy, achieve 3-D sensing, and adapt to node and network disruptions in harsh environments. We describe hardware design trade-offs, the software architecture, and the implementation that enables limited-capability nodes to collectively achieve application goals. Through the indoor fire monitoring application scenario we validate that the platform can achieve coverage and sensing accuracy that matches or exceeds static sensor networks and provide higher adaptability and autonomy.

Ultra-low power time synchronization using passive radio receivers

Considering its central importance to sensor networks, time synchronization has received extensive attention by the research community. Nevertheless, we argue in this paper that existing approaches introduce undesirable trade-offs. For example, while GPS offers excellent accuracy for outdoor deployments, the high cost and power consumption of GPS receivers make them prohibitive to many applications. Message-passing protocols, such as FTSP, introduce different sets of compromises and constraints. In this paper, we present an inexpensive and ultra-low power (&lt;; 100 μA) mote peripheral, we term the Universal Time Signal Receiver, that leverages the availability of time signals transmitted by dedicated radio stations around the globe to provide access to UTC time with millisecond-level accuracy. We present experimental results measuring signal availability, quality of synchronization across motes, and power consumption. We show that the proposed universal time signal receiver achieves global time synchronization and for applications where millisecond-level precision is sufficient, it consumes up to 1,000 times less energy than GPS or FTSP.

Duty-cycling buildings aggressively: The next frontier in HVAC control

Buildings are known to be the largest consumers of electricity in the United States, and often times the dominant energy consumer is the HVAC system. Despite this fact, in most buildings the HVAC system is run using primitive static control algorithms based on fixed work schedules causing wasted energy during periods of low occupancy. In this paper we present a novel control architecture that uses occupancy sensing to guide the operation of a building HVAC system. We show how we can enable aggressive duty-cycling of building HVAC systems - that is, turn them ON or OFF - to save energy while meeting building performance requirements using inexpensive sensing and control methods. We have deployed our occupancy sensor network across an entire floor of a university building and our data shows several periods of low occupancy with significant opportunities to save energy over normal HVAC schedules. Furthermore, by interfacing with the building Energy Management System (EMS) directly and using real-time occupancy data collected by our occupancy nodes, we measure electrical energy savings of 9.54% to 15.73% and thermal energy savings of 7.59% to 12.85% for the HVAC system by controlling just one floor of our four floor building.

Heating, cooling and ventilation accounts for 35% energy usage in the United States. Currently, most modern buildings still condition rooms assuming maximum occupancy rather than actual usage. As a result, rooms are often over-conditioned needlessly. Thus, in order to achieve efficient conditioning, we require knowledge of occupancy. This paper shows how real time occupancy data from a wireless sensor network can be used to create occupancy models which in turn can be integrated into building conditioning system for usage based demand control conditioning strategies. Using strategies based on sensor network occupancy model predictions, we show that it is possible to achieve 42% annual energy savings while still maintaining American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning (ASHRAE) comfort standards.

Radio diversity for reliable communication in WSNs

2011
Deployment of wireless sensors in real world environments is often a frustrating experience. The quality of radio links is highly coupled to unpredictable physical environments, leading to intermittent connectivity and frequent outages. Because link qualities are not predictable prior to deployment, current deterministic solutions to unreliable links, such as increasing network density or transmission power, do not adequately address this issue. We propose a new dual radio network architecture to improve communication reliability in wireless sensor networks. Specifically, we show that radio transceivers operating at dual widely spaced radio frequencies and through spatially separated antennas offer robust communication, high link diversity, and better interference mitigation. We show through experiments that radio diversity can significantly improve end-to-end delivery rates, network stability, and transmission costs at only a slight increase in energy cost over a single radio.

Reconstruction of the correct temporal order of sensor network data

2011
Collecting highly accurate scientific measurements asks for highest data quality and yield. But, satisfying these requirements is non-trivial, when considering phenomena common to wireless sensing systems such as clock drift, packet duplicates, packet loss and device reboots. Previous experience shows that these problems have not been resolved sufficiently by system design. In this paper, we introduce an offline approach to improve data quality by (a) providing a formal system model, (b) verifying conformance of packets received to this model, (c) providing the corrected packet sequence, and (d) providing additional information on packet generation inferred from temporally adjacent packets. We apply this method to a substantial amount of data from a real-world deployment and show the usefulness of this new intermediate packet processing step. In our validation of the proposed algorithm, we find that our approach successfully reconstructs the correct order of packet data streams. On application of the proposed data cleaning only a single violation is found when cross-validating a sequence of more than 4.6 million packets with ground truth derived from duplicate sensor data recovered from external storage post-deployment. The proposed method is thus suitable for both enhancing data accuracy on the occurrence of faults as well as the validation of data integrity.

Foresee (4C): Wireless link prediction using link features
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
As an integral part of reliable communication in wireless networks, effective link estimation is essential for routing protocols. However, due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose 4C, a novel link estimator that applies link quality prediction along with link estimation. Our approach is data-driven and consists of three steps: data collection, offline modeling and online prediction. The data collection step involves gathering link quality data, and based on our analysis of the data, we propose a set of guidelines for the amount of data to be collected in our experimental scenarios. The modeling step includes offline prediction model training and selection. We present three prediction models that utilize different machine learning methods, namely, naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression and artificial neural networks. Our models take a combination of PRR and the physical layer information, i.e., Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) as input, and output the success probability of delivering the next packet. From our analysis and experiments, we find that logistic regression works well among the three models with small computational cost. Finally, the third step involves the implementation of 4C, a receiver-initiated online link quality prediction module that computes the short temporal link quality. We conducted extensive experiments in the Motelab and our local indoor testbeds, as well as an outdoor deployment. Our results with single and multiple senders experiments show that with 4C, CTP improves the average cost of delivering a packet by 20% to 30%. In some cases, the improvement is larger than 45%.

Unified broadcast in sensor networks

2011
Complex sensor network applications include multiple services such as collection, dissemination, time synchronization, and failure detection protocols. Many of these protocols require local state maintenance through periodic broadcasts which leads to high control overhead. Recent attempts to consolidate these broadcasts focus on piggybacking information into existing services but such tight coupling between protocols limits code reuse and interoperability of applications. We present Unified Broadcast (UB) which combines broadcasts from multiple protocols while maintaining a modular architecture of the network stack. UB is implemented as a transparent layer between the link and network layers, where it delays, schedules, and combines broadcasts from upper layer protocols before transmission on the wireless channel. Our empirical results in simulation and on a testbed show that UB can decrease the overall packet transmissions in the network by more than 60%, corresponding to more than 40% energy savings, without requiring new interfaces or affecting the correctness of the upper layer protocols.

Convex programming based robust localization in NLOS prone cluttered environments
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
In a large variety of industrial scale processes, fixed or mobile sensors are typically deployed in large-scale vessels to monitor parameters such as temperature, pressure and chemical concentration. When these vessels are cluttered with obstacles, e.g. large cooling ponds cluttered with nuclear waste containers, it becomes increasingly difficult for the sensors to estimate their position. The acoustic ranging signals used for estimating distances between each sensor node and reference nodes fixed to the vessel infrastructure can suffer from Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signal propagation and thus introduce large positive errors in some of the estimated distances. In this paper we present a robust localization algorithm for localizing sensors in cluttered NLOS environments. We show that if the number of erroneous range measurements is less than half, it is possible to accurately estimate these NLOS errors at each sensor node by solving a convex optimization problem. Each sensor node can then use its estimate of NLOS errors to accurately localize itself. Our approach is completely independent of the physical hardware used to perform range measurements and thus can be used to localize sensor nodes in any NLOS prone environment. We demonstrate this with the help of experimental results with three different hardware platforms each employing a different ranging mechanism.

Localising speech, footsteps and other sounds using resource-constrained devices

2011
While a number of acoustic localisation systems have been proposed over the last few decades, these have typically either relied on expensive dedicated microphone arrays and workstation-class processing, or have been developed to detect a very specific type of sound in a particular scenario. However, as people live and work indoors, they generate a wide variety of sounds as they interact and move about. These human-generated sounds can be used to infer the positions of people, without requiring them to wear trackable tags. In this paper, we take a practical yet general approach to localising a number of human-generated sounds. Drawing from signal processing literature, we identify methods for resource-constrained devices in a sensor network to detect, classify and locate acoustic events such as speech, footsteps and objects being placed onto tables. We evaluate the classification and time-of-arrival estimation algorithms using a data set of human-generated sounds we captured with sensor nodes in a controlled setting. We show that despite the variety and complexity of the sounds, their localisation is feasible for sensor networks, with typical accuracies of a half metre or better. We specifically discuss the processing and networking considerations, and explore the performance trade-offs which can be made to further conserve resources.

Sequential Monte Carlo for simultaneous passive device-free tracking and sensor localization using received signal strength measurements
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2011
This paper presents and evaluates a method for simultaneously tracking a target while localizing the sensor nodes of a passive device-free tracking system. The system uses received signal strength (RSS) measurements taken on the links connecting many nodes in a wireless sensor network, with nodes deployed such that the links overlap across the region. A target moving through the region attenuates links intersecting or nearby its path. At the same time, RSS measurements provide information about the relative locations of sensor nodes. We utilize the Sequential Monte Carlo (particle filtering) framework for tracking, and we use an online EM algorithm to simultaneously estimate static parameters (including the sensor locations, as well as model parameters including noise variance and attenuation strength of the target). Simultaneous tracking, online calibration and parameter estimation enable rapid deployment of a RSS-based device free localization system, e.g., in emergency response scenarios. Simulation results and experiments with a wireless sensor network testbed illustrate that the proposed tracking method performs well in a variety of settings.

μSETL: A set based programming abstraction for wireless sensor networks
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2011
Programming wireless sensor networks is a major challenge, even for experienced programmers. To alleviate this problem, prior work has proposed a paradigm shift from node-level microprogramming to macroprogramming, where the user specifies a distributed application using a single macroprogram that is automatically translated into a set of node-level microprograms. This paper makes the case that node-level microprogramming itself can be made much easier by using the right set of programming abstractions. To support this claim, this paper presents μSETL, a programming abstraction for sensor networks based on set theory. Sets offer a powerful formalism and high expressiveness, yet are a natural way of thinking about resource abstraction in sensor networks. In addition to the set abstraction, μSETL features programming constructs that enable event-driven programming at a high level of abstraction, thereby significantly simplifying node-level microprogramming. μSETL consists of a set-based programming language, a compiler that translates μSETL programs into node-specific application code, and a runtime environment that provides various services to support the set-based programming abstraction. μSETL has been implemented using the Contiki operating system and runs on the Telos motes. Experimental results demonstrate that μSETL enables programmers to write various sensor network applications in a natural and highly compact manner with minimal overheads.

EcoCast: Interactive, object-oriented macroprogramming for networks of ultra-compact wireless sensor nodes

2011
EcoCast is an execution framework for macroprogramming of wireless sensor networks. Users access sensor nodes as dynamic objects in Python by invoking methods on them without being concerned with network protocols, and type marshalling and demarshalling ensure proper data access. EcoCast extends Python's functional programming primitives map(), reduce(), and filter() to macroprogramming with several synchrony semantics and job-control options. EcoCast can compile Python lambda expressions and functions to run on the nodes at native speed without requiring most users to write code in C or assembly, and it patches the firmware transparently without rebooting. The use of Python also facilitates host-side application development by enabling developers to take full advantage of the rich code libraries and data structures in Python. Experimental results show the reprogramming and execution latencies of EcoCast scale well over the size of the network while occupying a small memory footprint.

Fast-Lipschitz optimization with wireless sensor networks applications
Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2011
Motivated by the need for fast computations demanded by wireless sensor networks, the new F-Lipschitz optimization theory is introduced for a novel class of optimization problems. These problems are defined by simple qualifying properties specified in terms of increasing objective function and contractive constraints. It is shown that feasible F-Lipschitz problems have always a unique optimal solution that satisfies the constraints at equality. The solution is obtained quickly by asynchronous algorithms of certified convergence. F-Lipschitz optimization can be applied to both centralized and distributed optimization. Compared to traditional Lagrangian methods, which often converge linearly, the convergence time of centralized F-Lipschitz problems is at least superlinear. Distributed F-Lipschitz algorithms converge fast, as opposed to traditional Lagrangian decomposition and parallelization methods, which generally converge slowly and at the price of many message passings. In both cases, the computational complexity is much lower than traditional Lagrangian methods. Examples of application of the new optimization method are given for distributed detection and radio power control in wireless sensor networks. The drawback of the F-Lipschitz optimization is that it might be difficult to check the qualifying properties. For more general optimization problems, it is suggested that it is convenient to have conditions ensuring that the solution satisfies the constraints at equality.

Smartphone peripherals like the Square card reader, Red-Eye mini, and HiJack platform suggest a growing interest in using the headset port for more than just headsets. How-ever, these peripherals only support sporadic activities in an efficient manner. Continuous sensing applications - like monitoring EKG signals - is possible but remains too inefficient for many realistic usage scenarios. We present Au-dioDAQ, a new sensor data acquisition platform. In contrast with prior work, AudioDAQ requires no hardware or software modifications on the phone, uses significantly less power, and allows continuous data capture over extended periods of time. The design is efficient because we draw all necessary power from the microphone bias voltage, and it is general because this voltage is present in every headset port. Data is modulated within the audible range, captured with the built-in voice recording app, and sent to a server for processing and storage. We show the viability of this approach by demonstrating an EKG monitor that can capture data continuously for hours.

Demo abstract: Scaling the wireless AC power meter

2012
We explore the seemingly trivial problem of scaling the AC power meter to a cubic-inch form factor. This small volume, necessary for unobtrusive inline plug-load monitoring, requires aggressive electromechanical codesign and 3-D electronics packaging. However, the key scaling challenge across both size and efficiency lies in the power supply architecture and load power. Hence, contrary to conventional wisdom, power is not free, even if a device is attached to wall power. Since many existing power supplies exhibit high baseline power draw, this leads to poor efficiency and runs counter to the green goals of many applications. We claim there are two paths to scaling the plug-load meter to a space-and power-efficient design point without sacrificing measurement fidelity: (i) by duty cycling in some cases and (ii) by using an off-line switching regulator that is not capacitor-fed. To evaluate our claims, we design a modular power meter architecture, implement several design alternatives, and evaluate their size, efficiency, and cost. We show that an energy-efficient, cubic-inch-sized wireless power meter is viable. Our design is 10&#x00D7; smaller, draws 3&#x00D7; less standby power, and still offers equivalent measurement fidelity as the best previously reported results.

An interactive and reprogrammable musical yo-yo system is designed. The aim of it is to demonstrate the feasibility of converting any sensor-enabled objects into potential musical instruments. This involves three design phases. First, the physical yo-yo is designed to house Iris sensors. The software is developed to sense the movement of yo-yo and transmit its measurements to Max/MSP for corresponding music generation. Finally, aurally pleasing and real-time musical sounds are designed and generated in effect of yo-yo by the computer music composer.

We present μSDR, a compact, inexpensive, and battery-powered software-defined radio (SDR) platform built on a single-chip, flash-based FPGA fabric and ARM Cortex-M3 processor, enabling lower power and tighter hardware/soft-ware integration than prior commodity SDR platforms. Our architecture, unlike prior designs, is well-suited to hand-held or battery-operated systems and also supports cleaner partitioning since hardware can be easily mapped into the software addresses space, and vice versa. Building on this flexibility, we show how highly time-critical MAC protocols can be implemented on this platform and deployed using just AAA batteries.

Micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) swarms are an emerging class of mobile sensing systems. Designing the next generation of such swarms requires the ability to rapidly test algorithms, sensors, and support infrastructure at scale. Simulation is useful in the early stages of such large-scale system design, when hardware is unavailable or deployment at scale is im-practical. To faithfully represent the problem domain, an MAV swarm simulator must be able to model all key aspects of the system: actuation, sensing, and communication. Further, it is important to be able to quickly test swarm behavior using different control algorithms in a varied set of environments, and with a variety of sensors. We demonstrate Simbeeotic, a simulation framework that is capable of modeling large-scale MAV swarms. Simbeeotic enables algorithm development and rapid prototyping through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experimentation. We demonstrate Simbeeotic running simulated applications and videos demonstrating hybrid experiments with simulated MAV s as well as helicopters flying in our test bed that show the power and versatility required to assist next generation swarm design.

This demonstration illustrates an information aggregation and summarization service for social sensing applications. Social sensing, using mobile phones and other networked devices in the possession of individuals, has gained significant popularity in recent years. In some cases, the information collected is structured, such as numeric data from temperature sensors, accelerometers, or GPS devices. Aggregate statistical properties, such as expected values, standard de-viations, and outliers, can be easily computed, and can be used to summarize the data set. In other cases, however, the collection includes unstructured data types such as text or images with textual annotations. The concepts of expected values and outliers are harder to define, yet it is still important to be able to aggregate and summarize the data. We demonstrate a system which can automatically summarize real-time textual data common to social sensing applications. Specifically, we focus on text messages that describe events in the environment. The output of our service provides a reliable summary of observations that can be used in many contexts from military intelligence to participatory sensing campaigns.

2012
This demonstration illustrates a service for collection and delivery of images, in participatory camera networks, to maximize coverage while removing outliers (i.e., irrelevant images). Images, such as those taken by smart-phone users, represent an important and growing modality in social sensing applications. They can be used, for instance, to document occurrences of interest in participatory sensing cam-paigns, such as instances of graffiti on campus or invasive species in a park. In applications with a significant number of participants, the number of images collected may be very large. A key problem becomes one of data triage to reduce the number of images delivered to a manageable count, without missing important ones. In prior work, the authors presented a service, called PhotoNet [2], that reduces redundancy among delivered images by maximizing diversity. The current work significantly extends our previous effort by recognizing that diversity maximization often leads to selection of outliers; images that are visually different but not necessarily relevant, which in fact reduces the quality of the delivered image pool. We demonstrate a new prioritization technique that maximizes diversity among delivered pictures, while also reducing outliers.

SunCast: Fine-grained prediction of natural sunlight levels for improved daylight harvesting

2012
Daylight harvesting is the use of natural sunlight to reduce the need for artificial lighting in buildings. The key challenge of daylight harvesting is to provide stable indoor lighting levels even though natural sunlight is not a stable light source. In this paper, we present a new technique called SunCast that improves lighting stability by predicting changes in future sunlight levels. The system has two parts: 1) it learns predictable sunlight patterns due to trees, nearby buildings, or other environmental factors, and 2) it controls the window transparency based on a quadratic optimization over predicted sunlight levels. To evaluate the system, we record daylight levels at 39 different windows for up to 12 weeks at a time, and apply our control algorithm on the data traces. Our results indicate that SunCast can reduce glare by 59% over a baseline approach with only a marginal increase in artificial lighting energy.

Closing the loop: A simple distributed method for control over wireless networks

2012
We present a distributed scheme used for control over a network of wireless nodes. As opposed to traditional networked control schemes where the nodes simply route information to and from a dedicated controller (perhaps performing some encoding along the way), our approach, Wireless Control Network (WCN), treats the network itself as the controller. In other words, the computation of the control law is done in a fully distributed way inside the network. We extend the basic WCN strategy, where at each time-step, each node updates its internal state to be a linear combination of the states of the nodes in its neighborhood. This causes the entire network to behave as a linear dynamical system, with sparsity constraints imposed by the network topology. We demonstrate that with observer style updates, the WCN's robustness to link failures is substantially improved. Fur-thermore, we show how to design a WCN that can maintain stability even in cases of node failures. We also address the problem of WCN synthesis with guaranteed optimal performance of the plant, with respect to standard cost functions. We extend the synthesis procedure to deal with continuous-time plants and demonstrate how the WCN can be used on a practical, industrial application, using a process-in-the-loop setup with real hardware.

An effective coreset compression algorithm for large scale sensor networks

The wide availability of networked sensors such as GPS and cameras is enabling the creation of sensor networks that generate huge amounts of data. For example, vehicular sensor networks where in-car GPS sensor probes are used to model and monitor traffic can generate on the order of gigabytes of data in real time. How can we compress streaming high-frequency data from distributed sensors? In this paper we construct coresets for streaming motion. The coreset of a data set is a small set which approximately represents the original data. Running queries or fitting models on the core-set will yield similar results when applied to the original data set. We present an algorithm for computing a small coreset of a large sensor data set. Surprisingly, the size of the coreset is independent of the size of the original data set. Combining map-and-reduce techniques with our coreset yields a system capable of compressing in parallel a stream of O(n) points using space and update time that is only O(log n). We provide experimental results and compare the algorithm to the popular Douglas-Peucker heuristic for compressing GPS data.

mPuff: Automated detection of cigarette smoking puffs from respiration measurements
2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2012
Smoking has been conclusively proved to be the leading cause of mortality that accounts for one in five deaths in the United States. Extensive research is conducted on developing effective smoking cessation programs. Most smoking cessation programs achieve low success rate because they are unable to intervene at the right moment. Identification of high-risk situations that may lead an abstinent smoker to relapse involve discovering the associations among various contexts that precede a smoking session or a smoking lapse. In the absence of an automated method, detection of smoking events still relies on subject self-report that is prone to failure to report and involves subject burden. Automated detection of smoking events in the natural environment can revolutionize smoking research and lead to effective intervention. In this paper, we present mPuff a novel system to automatically detect smoking puffs from respiration measurements, using which a model can be developed to automatically detect entire smoking episodes in the field. We introduce several new features from respiration that can help classify individual respiration cycles into smoking puffs or non-puffs. We then propose supervised and semi-supervised support vector models to detect smoking puffs. We train our models on data collected from 10 daily smokers and find that smoking puffs can be detected with an accuracy of 91% within a smoking session. We then consider respiration measurements during confounding events such as stress, speaking, and walking, and show that our model can still identify smoking puffs with an accuracy of 86.7%. The smoking detector presented here opens the opportunity to develop effective interventions that can be delivered on a mobile phone when and where smoking urges may occur, thereby improving the abysmal low rate of success in smoking cessation.

Accuracy-aware aquatic diffusion process profiling using robotic sensor networks

2012
Water resources and aquatic ecosystems are facing increasing threats from climate change, improper waste disposal, and oil spill incidents. It is of great interest to deploy mobile sensors to detect and monitor certain diffusion processes (e.g., chemical pollutants) that are harmful to aquatic en-vironments. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware diffusion process profiling approach using smart aquatic mobile sensors such as robotic fish. In our approach, the robotic sensors collaboratively profile the characteristics of a diffusion process including source location, discharged substance amount, and its evolution over time. In particular, the robotic sensors reposition themselves to progressively improve the profiling accuracy. We formulate a novel movement scheduling problem that aims to maximize the profiling accuracy subject to limited sensor mobility and energy budget. We develop an efficient greedy algorithm and a more complex near-optimal radial algorithm to solve the problem. We conduct extensive simulations based on real data traces of robotic fish movement and wireless communication. The results show that our approach can accurately profile dynamic diffusion processes under tight energy budgets. More-over, a preliminary evaluation based on the implementation on TelosB motes validates the feasibility of deploying our movement scheduling algorithms on mote-class robotic sensor platforms.

Error-resilient and complexity-constrained distributed coding for large scale sensor networks

2012
There has been considerable interest in distributed source coding within the compression and sensor network research communities in recent years, primarily due to its potential contributions to low-power sensor networks. However, two major obstacles pose an existential threat on practical deployment of such techniques in real world sensor networks, namely, the exponential growth of decoding complexity with network size and coding rates, and the critical requirement for error-resilience given the severe channel conditions in many wireless sensor networks. Motivated by these chal-lenges, this paper proposes a novel, unified approach for large scale, error-resilient distributed source coding, based on an optimally designed classifier-based decoding frame-work, where the design explicitly controls the decoding com-plexity. We also present a deterministic annealing (DA) based global optimization algorithm for the design due to the highly non-convex nature of the cost function, which further enhances the performance over basic greedy iterative descent technique. Simulation results on data, both synthetic and from real sensor networks, provide strong evidence that the approach opens the door to practical deployment of distributed coding in large sensor networks. It not only yields substantial gains in terms of overall distortion, compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, but also demonstrates how its decoder naturally scales to large networks while constraining the complexity, thereby enabling performance gains that increase with network size.

We describe the key ideas behind our implementation of distributed beamforming on a GNU-radio based software-defined radio platform. Distributed beamforming is a cooperative transmission scheme whereby a number of nodes in a wireless network organize themselves into a virtual antenna array and focus their transmission in the direction of the intended receiver, potentially achieving orders of magnitude improvements in energy efficiency. This technique has been extensively studied over the past decade and its practical feasibility has been demonstrated in multiple experimental prototypes. Our contributions in the work reported in this paper are three-fold: (a) the first ever all-wireless implementation of distributed beamforming without any secondary wired channels for clock distribution or channel feedback, (b) a novel digital baseband approach to synchronization of high frequency RF signals that requires no hardware mod-ifications, and (c) an implementation of distributed beam-forming on a standard, open platform that allows easy reuse and extension. We describe the design of our system in de-tail present some initial results and discuss future directions for this work.

Magneto-Inductive NEtworked Rescue System (MINERS): Taking sensor networks underground

2012
Wireless underground networks are an emerging technology which have application in a number of scenarios. For example, in a mining disaster, flooding or a collapse can isolate portions of underground tunnels, severing wired communication links and preventing radio communication. In this pa-per, we explore the use of low frequency magnetic fields for communication, and present a new hardware platform that features triaxial transmitter/receiverantenna loops. We point out that the fundamental problem of the magnetic channel is the limited bitrate at long ranges, due to the extreme path loss of 60 dB/decade. To this end, we present two complementary techniques to address this limitation. Firstly, we demonstrate magnetic vector modulation, a technique which modulates the three dimensional orientation of the magnetic vector. This increases the gross bitrate by a factor of over 2.5, without an increase in transmission power or bandwidth. Secondly, we show how in a multi-hop network latencies can be dramatically reduced by receiving multiple parallel streams of frequency multiplexed data in a many-to-one configuration. These techniques are demonstrated on a working hardware platform, which for flexible operation, features a software defined magnetic transceiver. Typical communication range is approximately 30 m through rock.

Sensing through the continent: Towards monitoring migratory birds using cellular sensor networks

This paper presents CraneTracker, a novel sensor platform for monitoring migratory birds. The platform is designed to monitor Whooping Cranes, an endangered species that conducts an annual migration of 4,000 km between southern Texas and north-central Canada. CraneTracker includes a rich set of sensors, a multi-modal radio, and power control circuitry for sustainable, continental-scale information delivery during migration. The need for large-scale connectivity motivates the use of cellular technology in low-cost sensor platforms augmented by a low-power transceiver for ad-hoc connectivity. This platform leads to a new class of cellular sensor networks (CSNs) for time-critical and mobile sensing applications. The CraneTracker is evaluated via field tests on Wild Turkeys, Siberian Cranes, and an on-going alpha deployment with wild Sandhill Cranes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the potential of energy-harvesting CSNs for wildlife monitoring in large geographical areas, and reveal important insights into the movements and behaviors of migratory animals. In addition to benefiting ecological research, the developed platform is expected to extend the application domain of sensor networks and enable future research applications.

We present insights obtained from conducting a year-long, 455 meter deployment of wireless plug-load electric meters in a large commercial building. We develop a stratified sampling methodology for surveying the energy use of Miscellaneous Electric Loads (MELs) in commercial buildings, and apply it to our study building. Over the deployment period, we collected over nine hundred million individual readings. Among our findings, we document the need for a dynamic, scalable IPv6 routing protocol which supports point-to-point routing and multiple points of egress. Although the meters are static physically, we find that the set of links they use is dynamic; not using such a dynamic set results in paths that are twice as long. Finally, we conduct a detailed survey of the accuracy possible with inexpensive AC metering hardware. Based on a 21-point automated calibration of a population of 500 devices, we find that it is possible to produce nearly utility-grade metering data.

In-situ soil moisture sensing: Measurement scheduling and estimation using compressive sensing
2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2012
We consider the problem of monitoring soil moisture evolution using a wireless network of in-situ underground sensors. To reduce cost and prolong lifetime, it is highly desirable to rely on fewer measurements and estimate with higher accuracy the original signal (soil moisture temporal evolution). In this paper we explore results from the compressive sensing (CS) literature and examine their applicability to this problem. Our main challenge lies in the selection of two matrices, the measurement matrix and a representation basis. The physical constraints of our problem make it highly nontrivial to select these matrices, so that the latter can sufficient sparsify the underlying signal while at the same time be sufficiently incoherent with the former, two common pre-conditions for CS techniques to work well. We construct a representation basis by exploiting unique features of soil moisture evolution. We show that this basis attains very good tradeoff between its ability to sparsify the signal and its incoherence with measurement matrices that are consistent with our physical constraints. Extensive numerical evaluation is performed on both real, high-resolution soil moisture data and simulated data, and through comparison with a closed-loop scheduling approach. Our results demonstrate that our approach is extremely effective in reconstructing the soil moisture process with high accuracy and low sampling rate.

TriopusNet: Automating wireless sensor network deployment and replacement in pipeline monitoring
2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2012
This study presents TriopusNet, a mobile wireless sensor network system for autonomous sensor deployment in pipeline monitoring. TriopusNet works by automatically releasing sensor nodes from a centralized repository located at the source of the water pipeline. During automated deployment, TriopusNet runs a sensor deployment algorithm to determine node placement. While a node is flowing inside the pipeline, it performs placement by extending its mechanical arms to latch itself onto the pipe's inner surface. By continuously releasing nodes into pipes, the TriopusNet system builds a wireless network of interconnected sensor nodes. When a node runs at a low battery level or experiences a fault, the TriopusNet system releases a fresh node from the repository and performs a node replacement algorithm to replace the failed node with the fresh one. We have evaluated the TriopusNet system by creating and collecting real data from an experimental pipeline testbed. Comparing with the nonautomated static deployment, TriopusNet is able to use less sensor nodes to cover a sensing area in the pipes while maintaining network connectivity among nodes with high data collection rate. Experimental results also show that TriopusNet can recover from the network disconnection caused by a battery-depleted node and successfully replace the battery-depleted node with a fresh node.

Collaborative calibration and sensor placement for mobile sensor networks

2012
Mobile sensing systems carried by individuals or machines make it possible to measure position- and time-dependent environmental conditions, such as air quality and radiation. The low-cost, miniature sensors commonly used in these systems are prone to measurement drift, requiring occasional re-calibration to provide accurate data. Requiring end users to periodically do manual calibration work would make many mobile sensing systems impractical. We therefore argue for the use of collaborative, automatic calibration among nearby mobile sensors, and provide solutions to the drift estimation and placement problems posed by such a system. Collaborative calibration opportunistically uses interactions among sensors to adjust their calibration functions and error estimates. We use measured sensor drift data to determine properties of time-varying drift error. We then develop (1) both optimal and heuristic algorithms that use information from multiple collaborative calibration events for error compensation and (2) algorithms for stationary sensor placement, which can further decrease system-wide drift error in a mobile, personal sensing system. We evaluated the proposed techniques using real-world and synthesized human motion traces. The most advanced existing work has 23.2% average sensing error, while our collaborative calibration technique reduces the error to 2.2%. The appropriate placement of accurate stationary sensors can further reduce this error.

Efficient cross-correlation via sparse representation in sensor networks

2012
Cross-correlation is a popular signal processing technique used in numerous localization and tracking systems for obtaining reliable range information. However, a practical efficient implementation has not yet been achieved on resource constrained wireless sensor network platforms. We propose cross-correlation via sparse representation: a new framework for ranging based on &#x2113;1-minimization. The key idea is to compress the signal samples on the mote platform by efficient random projections and transfer them to a central device, where a convex optimization process estimates the range by exploiting its sparsity in our proposed correlation domain. Through sparse representation theory validation, extensive empirical studies and experiments on an end-to-end acoustic ranging system implemented on resource limited off-the-shelf sensor nodes, we show that the proposed framework, together with the proposed correlation domain achieved up to two order of magnitude better performance compared to naive approaches such as working on DCT domain and downsampling. Furthermore, compared to cross-correlation results, 30-40% measurements are sufficient to obtain precise range estimates with an additional bias of only 2-6 cm for high accuracy application requirements, while 5% measurements are adequate to achieve approximately 100 cm precision for lower accuracy applications.

Strawman: Resolving collisions in bursty low-power wireless networks

Low-power wireless networks must leverage radio duty cycling to reduce energy consumption, but duty cycling drastically increases the risk of radio collisions, resulting in power-expensive retransmissions or data loss. We present Strawman, a contention resolution mechanism designed for low-power duty-cycled networks that experience traffic bursts. Strawman efficiently resolves network contention, mitigates the hidden terminal problem, and has zero overhead unless activated to resolve data collisions. Our testbed experiments show that Strawman instantaneously provides increased network capacity when needed, allocates the available bandwidth evenly among contenders, and increases energy efficiency in multihop collection networks compared to the traditionally used random backoff.

pTUNES: Runtime parameter adaptation for low-power MAC protocols

2012
We present pTUNES, a framework for runtime adaptation of low-power MAC protocol parameters. The MAC operating parameters bear great influence on the system performance, yet their optimal choice is a function of the current network state. Based on application requirements expressed as network lifetime, end-to-end latency, and end-to-end reliability, pTUNES automatically determines optimized parameter values to adapt to link, topology, and traffic dynamics. To this end, we introduce a flexible modeling approach, separating protocol-dependent from protocol-independent aspects, which facilitates using pTUNES with different MAC protocols, and design an efficient system support that integrates smoothly with the application. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply pTUNES to X-MAC and LPP. In a 44-node testbed, pTUNES achieves up to three-fold lifetime gains over static MAC parameters optimized for peak traffic, the latter being current-and almost unavoidable-practice in real deployments. pTUNES promptly reacts to changes in traffic load and link quality, reducing packet loss by 80 % during periods of controlled wireless interference. Moreover, pTUNES helps the routing protocol recover quickly from critical network changes, reducing packet loss by 70 % in a scenario where multiple core routing nodes fail.

Low power, low delay: Opportunistic routing meets duty cycling
2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2012
Traditionally, routing in wireless sensor networks consists of two steps: First, the routing protocol selects a next hop, and, second, the MAC protocol waits for the intended destination to wake up and receive the data. This design makes it difficult to adapt to link dynamics and introduces delays while waiting for the next hop to wake up. In this paper we introduce ORW, a practical opportunistic routing scheme for wireless sensor networks. In a duty-cycled setting, packets are addressed to sets of potential receivers and forwarded by the neighbor that wakes up first and successfully receives the packet. This reduces delay and energy consumption by utilizing all neighbors as potential forwarders. Furthermore, this increases resilience to wireless link dynamics by exploiting spatial diversity. Our results show that ORW reduces radio duty-cycles on average by 50% (up to 90% on individual nodes) and delays by 30% to 90% when compared to the state of the art.

Grafting energy-harvesting leaves onto the sensornet tree

2012
We study the problem of augmenting battery-powered sensornet trees with energy-harvesting leaf nodes. Our results show that leaf nodes that are smaller in size than today's typical battery-powered sensors can harvest enough energy from ambient sources to acquire and transmit sensor readings every minute, even under poor lighting conditions. However, achieving this functionality, especially as leaf nodes scale in size, requires new platforms, protocols, and programming. Platforms must be designed around low-leakage operation, offer a richer power supply control interface for system software, and employ an unconventional energy storage hierarchy. Protocols must not only be low-power, but they must also become low-energy, which affects initial and ongoing synchronization, and periodic communications. Systems programming, and especially bootup and communications, must become low-latency, by eliminating conservative timeouts and startup dependencies, and embracing high-concurrency. Applying these principles, we show that robust, indoor, perpetual sensing is viable using off-the-shelf technology.

Improving RF-based device-free passive localization in cluttered indoor environments through probabilistic classification methods
2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2012
Radio frequency based device-free passive localization has been proposed as an alternative to indoor localization because it does not require subjects to wear a radio device. This technique observes how people disturb the pattern of radio waves in an indoor space and derives their positions accordingly. The well-known multipath effect makes this problem very challenging, because in a complex environment it is impractical to have enough knowledge to be able to accurately model the effects of a subject on the surrounding radio links. In addition, even minor changes in the environment over time change radio propagation sufficiently to invalidate the datasets needed by simple fingerprint-based methods. In this paper, we develop a fingerprinting-based method using probabilistic classification approaches based on discriminant analysis. We also devise ways to mitigate the error caused by multipath effect in data collection, further boosting the classification likelihood. We validate our method in a one-bedroom apartment that has 8 transmitters, 8 receivers, and a total of 32 cells that can be occupied. We show that our method can correctly estimate the occupied cell with a likelihood of 97.2%. Further, we show that the accuracy remains high, even when we significantly reduce the training overhead, consider fewer radio devices, or conduct a test one month later after the training. We also show that our method can be used to track a person in motion and to localize multiple people with high accuracies. Finally, we deploy our method in a completely different commercial environment with two times the area achieving a cell estimation accuracy of 93.8% as an evidence of applicability to multiple environments.

Design and evaluation of a wireless magnetic-based proximity detection platform for indoor applications

Many indoor sensing applications leverage knowledge of relative proximity among physical objects and humans, such as the notion of &#x201C;within arm's reach&#x201D;. In this paper, we quantify this notion using &#x201C;proximity zone&#x201D;, and propose a methodology that empirically and systematically compare the proximity zones created by various wireless technologies. We find that existing technologies such as 802.15.4, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and RFID fall short on metrics such as boundary sharpness, robustness against in-terference, and obstacle penetration. We then present the design and evaluation of a wireless proximity detection platform based on magnetic induction - LiveSynergy. LiveSynergy provides sweet spot for indoor applications that require reliable and precise proximity detection. Finally, we present the design and evaluation of an end-to-end system, deployed inside a large food court to offer context-aware and personalized advertisements and diet suggestions at a per-counter granularity.

On truth discovery in social sensing: A maximum likelihood estimation approach
2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2012
This paper addresses the challenge of truth discovery from noisy social sensing data. The work is motivated by the emergence of social sensing as a data collection paradigm of growing interest, where humans perform sensory data collection tasks. A challenge in social sensing applications lies in the noisy nature of data. Unlike the case with well-calibrated and well-tested infrastructure sensors, humans are less reliable, and the likelihood that participants' measurements are correct is often unknown a priori. Given a set of human participants of unknown reliability together with their sensory measurements, this paper poses the question of whether one can use this information alone to determine, in an analytically founded manner, the probability that a given measurement is true. The paper focuses on binary measurements. While some previous work approached the answer in a heuristic manner, we offer the first optimal solution to the above truth discovery problem. Optimality, in the sense of maximum likelihood estimation, is attained by solving an expectation maximization problem that returns the best guess regarding the correctness of each measurement. The approach is shown to outperform the state of the art fact-finding heuristics, as well as simple baselines such as majority voting.

The Whooping Crane is an endangered species native to North America and there are approximately 575 in existence. There have been recent efforts to provide ecologists with a tool to study the multifaceted behavior of the endangered species. Like many species, cranes display distinctly identifiable movements while being threatened, acting territorial, migrating, or preening. The preliminary experiments described in this poster provide evidence that sensor data presented by a novel sensing platform, the CraneTracker, can be used to identify crane behaviors on-board. With the ability to identify these behaviors, ecologists will have a more granular insight on what occurs during a crane's life on a daily basis.

Device-free passive (DfP) localization is proposed to localize human subjects indoors by observing how the subject disturbs the pattern of the radio signals without having the subject wear a tag. In our previous work, we have proposed a probabilistic classification based DfP technique, which we call PC-DfP in short, and demonstrated that PC-DfP can classify which cell (32 cells in total) is occupied by the stationary subject with an accuracy as high as 97.2% in a one-bedroom apartment. In this poster, we focus on extending PC-DfP to track a mobile subject in indoor environments by taking into consideration that a human subject's locations should form a continuous trajectory. Through experiments in a 10 &#x00D7; 15 meters open plan office, we show that we can achieve better accuracies by exploiting the property of continuous mobility trajectories.

We present a beamforming method for estimating the directions and locations of multiple sources and separating each source's spectrum from field data collected by a wireless acoustic sensor network. Each acoustic sensor is equipped with four microphones that receive acoustic signals in a time-synchronized manner. The difference in time-of-arrival of proximal signals depends on the source direction with respect to the geometry of the microphone array. We show that by using beamforming in the frequency domain, the locations and Direction-Of-Arrivals (DOAs) of multiple 3D sources may be estimated, and the source spectrum may be separated from the audio data spectra.

The maturity and availability of network protocols have enabled wireless sensor networks (WSN) designers to build heterogeneous applications by composing different protocols. A common heterogeneous application combines data collection and dissemination for environmental monitoring with node retasking. While these co-located protocols on the same node have different goals, many of them share requirements and characteristics. Examples of commonalities include the use of bi-directional traffic for reliable transmissions and tree for packet routing. This work explores how the MAC layer can reduce the network transmission overhead of heterogeneous applications by taking advantage of protocol commonalities to aggregate outgoing packets. In other words, this aggregation creates a train of packets destined to the same receiver. Finally, we discuss a strawman implementation of packet train and how our data center monitoring deployment leverages it.

Poster abstract: Detecting faulty street lamps with illumination maps

2012
Badly lit roads usually lead to vehicle accidents and encourage crime in the area. Therefore, it is important to detect faulty street lamps rapidly and report them to related authorities to keep roads safe. Currently, communities still mostly depend on electrical inspectors to check street lamps regularly, which may result in long time delays for repair. Recent studies focus on add networking capability into street lamp poles to enable real-time reports on the healthy status of lamps. However, such a smart system increases costs to add sensors and network modules in every street lamp; therefore, it is nearly impossible to realize this kind of system in a short term. We propose a new method to detect faulty lamps. We designed equipment that could be installed on fixed bus routes and collect the lighting intensity along the routes. We created illumination maps in meter-level resolution. The differences between illumination maps created at different times can help identify the changes of lighting intensity in specific locations. We executed a proof-of-concept experiment that shows our method is feasible. This method can be extended to a citywide scale at low cost. As a result, this would detect faulty street lamps along main roads and prevent accidents and crime by shortening the duration of badly lit streets.

Poster abstract: TDOA sensor pairing in multi-hop sensor networks

2012
Acoustic source localization based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements from spatially separated sensors is an important problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). While extensive research works have been performed on algorithm development, limited attention has been paid in how to form the sensor pairs. In the literature, most of the works adopt a centralized sensor pairing strategy, where only one common sensor node is chosen as the reference. However, due to the multi-hop nature of WSNs, it is well known that this kind of centralized signal processing method is power consuming since raw measurement data is involved in the transmissions. To reduce the requirements for both network bandwidth and power consumptions, we propose an in-network sensor pairing method to collect the TDOA measurements while guaranteeing the quality of source localization. The solution involves finding a minimal sized dominating set (MSDS) for a graph of the muti-hop network. It has been proved that in-network sensor pairing can result in the same Cramer-Rao-Bound (CRB) as the centralized one but at a far more less communication cost. Furthermore, the structure of the proposed in-network sensor pairing coincides with the decentralized source localization, which is an important application of our method.

We present the low-power wireless bus (LWB), a simple yet efficient communication support for low-power wireless networks. The LWB maps different communication demands onto fast Glossy network flooding, effectively turning the wireless network into a bus-like infrastructure. The LWB requires no information of the network topology, thus drastically reducing the control overhead of common solutions such as route maintenance, and natively supports many-to-many communication and mobile nodes in addition to more traditional static, one-to-many scenarios. For instance, experiments on a 90-node testbed show that on average the LWB reduces packet loss by a factor of 231 and energy consumption due to communication by a factor of 11 compared to a state-of-the-art many-to-many routing protocol.

The algorithm is based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a Single layer Feed-forward neural Network (SLFN). It is competitive fast in offline learning and online localization. Also, compared with existing fingerprinting approach, it does not need the fingerprinting database in the online phase, which can substantially reduce the required storage space of the terminal devices.

Effectively managing the data generated by Large-area Community driven Sensor Networks (LCSNs) is a new and challenging problem. One important step for managing and querying such sensor network data is to create abstractions of the data in the form of models. These models can then be stored, retrieved, and queried, as required. In our OpenSense1 project, we advocate an adaptive model-cover driven strategy towards effectively managing such data. Our strategy is designed considering the fundamental principles of LCSNs. We describe an adaptive approach, called adaptive k-means, and report preliminary results on how it compares with the traditional grid-based approach towards modeling LCSN data. We find that our approach performs better to model the sensed phenomenon in spatial and temporal dimensions. Our results are based on two real datasets.

Reducing energy cost is crucial for energy-constrained smart wireless cameras. Existing platforms impose two main challenges: First, most commercial smart phones have a closed platform, which makes it impossible to manage low-level circuits. Since the sampling frequency is moderate in environmental monitoring context, any improper power management in idle period will incur significant energy leak. Secondly, low-end cameras tailored for wireless sensor networks usually have limited processing power or communication range, and thus are not capable of outdoor monitoring task under low data rate. To tackle these issues, we develop Sensorcam, a long-range, smart wireless camera running a Linux-base open system. Through better power management in idle period and the &#x201C;intelligence&#x201D; of the camera it-self, we demonstrate an energy-efficient wireless monitoring system in a real deployment.

Background subtraction is often the first step in many computer vision applications such as object localisation and tracking. It aims to segment out moving parts of a scene that represent object of interests. In the field of computer vision, researchers have dedicated their efforts to improve the robustness and accuracy of such segmentations but most of their methods are computationally intensive, making them nonviable options for our targeted embedded camera platform whose energy and processing power is significantly more con-strained. To address this problem as well as maintain an acceptable level of performance, we introduce Compressive Sensing (CS) to the widely used Mixture of Gaussian to create a new background subtraction method. The results show that our method not only can decrease the computation significantly (a factor of 7 in a DSP setting) but remains comparably accurate.

Commercial optical human motion capture systems perform well in studio-like environments, but they do not provide solution in daily-life surroundings. Micro-sensor motion capture has shown its potentials because of its ubiquity and low cost. We present an ambulatory low-cost real-time motion capture system using wearable micro-sensors (accelerometers, magnetometers and gyroscopes), which can capture and reconstruct human motion in real-time almost every-where. It mainly consists of three parts: a sensor subsystem, a data fusion subsystem and an animation subsystem. The sensor subsystem collects human motion signals and transfers them into the data fusion subsystem. The data fusion subsystem performs sensor fusion to obtain motion information, i.e., the orientation and position of each body segment. Using the motion information from the data fusion subsystem, the animation subsystem drives the avatar in the 3D virtual world in order to reconstruct human motion. All the processes are accomplished in real-time. The experimental results show that our system can capture motions and drive animations in real-time vividly without drift and delay. And the output from our system can be made use of in film-making, sports training and argument reality applications, etc.

As the application of WSNs for long-term monitoring purposes becomes real, the issue of WSN system health monitoring grows increasingly important. Manually understanding the root causes of an observed behavior is time-consuming and difficult, often knowledge of prior behavior is necessary for understanding the potential risk on the long-term system performance. The challenges lie in the balance between the amount of system data collected and the level of detail in which state can be inferred from this data. In this paper, we propose a lightweight runtime logging and corresponding network state inference mechanism that enables scalable WSN health monitoring. Concretely, we propose that nodes only report their internal state on the occurrence of important events. Having a very low computational complexity and message overhead within the sensor network, reported events are analyzed at a less constrained network sink.

Multi-hop time synchronization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is often time-consuming and error-prone due to random time-stamp delays for MAC layer access and unstable clocks of intermediate nodes. Constructive interference (CI), a recently discovered physical layer phenomenon, allows multiple nodes transmit and forward an identical packet simultaneously. By leveraging CI, we propose direct multihop (DMH) time synchronization by directly utilizing the time-stamps from the sink node instead of intermediate n-odes, which avoids the error caused by the unstable clock of intermediate nodes. DMH doesn't need decode the flooding time synchronization beacons. Moreover, DMH explores the linear regression technique in CI based time synchronization to counterbalance the clock drifts due to clock skews.

Poster abstract: Pair-wise reference-free fault detection in wireless sensor networks
2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2012
This poster presents a distributed reference-free fault detection algorithm which is based on local pair-wise verification. We show there exist a linear relationship between the output of any pair of sensors if the system excitations can be aggregated as a single system input. Using this relationship, faulty sensors suffering from sparse spike errors can be identified with high accuracy by our algorithm. An appealing feature of our method is that existence of reference sensors and knowledge of system input are not required. preliminary performance analysis shows that the algorithm is scalable, robust and able to detect most of the faults exist in the sen-sors. Communication power is also greatly reduced by the distributed nature of the algorithm.

Sensemaking for mobile health

Mobile health (mHealth) leverages the power and ubiquity of mobile and cloud technologies to support patients and clinicians in monitoring and understanding symptoms, side effects and treatment outside the clinical setting; thereby closing the feedback loops of self-care, clinical-care, and personal-evidence-creation. However, to realize this promise, we must develop new data capture, processing and modeling techniques to convert the digital exhaust emitted by mobile phone use into behavioral biomarkers. This calls for a modular layered sensemaking framework in which low level state classifications of raw data (e.g., estimated activity states such as sitting, walking, driving from continuous accelerometer and location traces), are used to derive mid-level semantic features (e.g., total number of ambulatory minutes, number of hours spent out of house), that can then be mapped to particular behavioral biomarkers for specific diseases (e.g., chronic pain, GI disfunction, MS, fatigue, depression, etc). The techniques needed to derive these markers will range from simple functions to machine learning classifiers, and will need to fuse diverse data types, but all will need to cope with noisy, erratic data sources. We are working to build an open architecture and community to speed the rate and robustness of innovation in this space, both academic and commercial (http://openmhealth.org).

Demo abstract: A radio tomographic system for real-time multiple people tracking

2013
A radio tomographic (RT) system uses the received signal strength (RSS) measurements collected on the links of a wireless mesh network composed of low-power transceivers in order to form real-time images of the attenuation field of the monitored area. These images indicate the position of people, without requiring them to participate in the localization effort by wearing or carrying any electronic device. Accurate localization and tracking of multiple people in real-time is required in several real-world applications, such as ambient-assisted living, tactical operations, and pedestrian traffic analysis in stores. In these scenarios, RT systems must perform reliably also a) when the number of targets is not known a priori and varies over time, and b) when people interact, i.e., have intersecting trajectories, in the monitored area. We demonstrate a RT system which tackles all of these challenges and provides accurate tracking of a varying and unknown number of people (both stationary and mobile) in real-time.

In this demonstration, we show an energy measurement system that estimates the energy consumption of individual appliances using a wireless sensor network consisting of contactless electromagnetic field (EMF) sensors deployed near each appliance, and a whole-house power meter [1]. The EMF sensor can detect appliance state transitions within close proximity based on magnetic field fluctuations. Data from these sensors are then relayed back to the main meter using a low-latency wireless sensor networking protocol, where changes in the total power consumption of the house are used to determine the power usage of individual appliances. The sensors are low-cost, easy to deploy and are able to detect current changes associated with the appliance from a few inches away making it possible to externally monitor in-wall wiring to devices like overhead lights or heavy machinery that might operate on multiple phases of the AC distribution system of the building. Appliance-level energy data provide continuous feedback to end users about their consumption patterns and provide building managers accurate information that can be used to target the most effective update and retrofit strategies.

Demo abstract - Netamorph: Field-programmable analog arrays for energy-efficient sensor networks

2013
The limited power budgets of sensor networks necessitate some level of in-network pre-processing to reduce communication overhead. The low power consumption of analog signal processing (ASP) is well-suited for this task. However, the quick adoption of this technology has been restrained by the fact that ASP implementation requires a priori knowledge of the application space. Our solution to this challenge is to enable run-time reconfiguration through the use of a field-programmable analog array (FPAA). In the same way that reconfigurable digital systems allow system designers to change the infrastructure of digital blocks, an FPAA allows an application developer to change the infrastructure of, and even tune, ASP blocks without circuit-level expertise. We will demonstrate that an FPAA can be used to (1) facilitate the use of ASP to reduce power consumption, and to (2) allow run-time reconfigurability to maximize ASP impact.

Limited visibility into the global network state renders testing and debugging sensor network applications a challenging task. Existing debugging methods are often non-intrusive and require modifications of the binary image. Hardware based debugging instrumentation such as JTAG has not been widely used beyond a single node, mainly due to its relatively high cost and lack of software support for distributed debugging. This demonstration presents a novel architecture for distributed debugging of wireless sensor networks using a low-cost extension board to access the on-chip debug module of the node's processor. Connecting several of those debug boards using a backbone network provides distributed control and monitoring of the sensor network in test.

Motivated by an availability gap for visual media, where images and videos are uploaded from mobile devices well after they are generated, we explore the selective, timely retrieval of media content from a collection of mobile devices. We envision this capability being driven by similarity-based queries posed to a cloud search front-end, which in turn dynamically retrieves media objects from mobile devices that best match the respective queries within a given time limit. Building upon a crowd-sensing framework, we have designed and implemented a system called MediaScope that provides this capability. MediaScope is an extensible framework that supports nearest-neighbor and other geometric queries on the feature space (e.g., clusters, spanners), and contains novel retrieval algorithms that attempt to maximize the retrieval of relevant information. From experiments on a prototype, MediaScope is shown to achieve near-optimal query completeness and low to moderate overhead on mobile devices.

Nemo features a new circuit design called shunt resistor switch that can dynamically adjust the resistance of shunt resistors based on the current load. This allows Nemo to achieve a wide dynamic current range and high measurement accuracy. Nemo transmits real-time power measurement to the host node solely through the power line, by modulating the current load and the supply voltage. This feature leads to a noninvasive, plug &amp; play design that allows Nemo to be easily installed on existing mote platforms without physical wiring or soldering. We describe the set-up of demonstration and outline our demonstration plan.

POEM: Power-efficient occupancy-based energy management system

Buildings account for 40% of US primary energy consumption and 72% of electricity. Of this total, 50% of the energy consumed in buildings is used for Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Current HVAC systems only condition based on static schedules; rooms are conditioned regardless of occupancy. By conditioning rooms only when necessary, greater efficiency can be achieved. This paper describes POEM, a complete closed-loop system for optimally controlling HVAC systems in buildings based on actual occupancy levels. POEM is comprised of multiple parts. A wireless network of cameras called OPTNet is developed that functions as an optical turnstile to measure area/zone occupancies. Another wireless sensor network of passive infrared (PIR) sensors called BONet functions along-side OPTNet. This sensed occupancy data from both systems are then fused with an occupancy prediction model using a particle filter in order to determine the most accurate current occupancy in each zone in the building. Finally, the information from occupancy prediction models and current occupancy is combined in order to find the optimal conditioning strategy required to reach target temperatures and minimize ventilation requirements. Based on live tests of the system, we estimate &#x2248; 30.0% energy saving can be achieved while still maintaining thermal comfort.

Acoustic shockwave-based bearing estimation

The paper presents a smartphone-based shooter localization system. As muzzle blasts are difficult to detect at longer distances and consequently present higher false detection rates, the system relies on shockwaves only. Each sensor uses four microphones to detect the Angle of Arrival and the length of the shockwave. This information, along with the sensor's own GPS coordinates, are shared among nearby smartphones. Assuming a known weapon type, it then proceeds to estimate the two possible projectile trajectory candidates for each sensor that are consistent with the observations in the horizontal plane of the sensors. A simple clustering algorithm identifies the correct projectile trajectory relying on as few as two sensors. The trajectory is then used to estimate the bearing to the shooter relative to each sensor. The paper presents the overall system architecture, the design of the sensor node that interfaces with the smartphone, the trajectory and bearing estimation algorithms, and the evaluation of the system based on a field experiment.

Radio tomographic imaging and tracking of stationary and moving people via kernel distance

Network radio frequency (RF) environment sensing (NRES) systems pinpoint and track people in buildings using changes in the signal strength measurements made by a wireless sensor network. It has been shown that such systems can locate people who do not participate in the system by wearing any radio device, even through walls, because of the changes that moving people cause to the static wireless sensor network. However, many such systems cannot locate stationary people. We present and evaluate a system which can locate stationary or moving people, without calibration, by using kernel distance to quantify the difference between two histograms of signal strength measurements. From five experiments, we show that our kernel distance-based radio tomographic localization system performs better than the state-of-the-art NRES systems in different non line-of-sight environments.

Using wearable inertial sensors for posture and position tracking in unconstrained environments through learned translation manifolds
2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2013
Despite recent advances in 3-D motion capture, the problem of simultaneously tracking human posture and position in an unconstrained environment remains open. Optical systems provide both types of information, but are confined to a restricted area of capture. Inertial sensing alleviates this restriction, but at the expense of capturing only relative (postural) and not absolute (positional) information. In this paper, we propose an algorithm combining the relative merits of these systems to track both position and posture in challenging environments. Offline, we combine an optical (Kinect) and an inertial sensing (Orient-4) platform to learn a mapping from posture variations to translations, which we encode as a translation manifold. Online, the optical source is removed, and the learned mapping is used to infer positions using the postures computed by the inertial sensors. We first evaluate our approach in simulation, on motion sequences with ground-truth positions for error estimation. Then, the method is deployed on physical sensing platforms to track human subjects. The proposed algorithm is shown to yield a lower average cumulative error than comparable position tracking methods, such as double integration of accelerometer data, on both simulated and real sensory data, and in a variety of motions and capture settings.

Think globally, act locally: On the reshaping of information landscapes
2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2013
In large-scale resource-constrained systems, such as wireless sensor networks, global objectives should be ideally achieved through inexpensive local interactions. A technique satisfying these requirements is information potentials, in which distributed functions disseminate information about the process monitored by the network. Information potentials are usually computed through local aggregation or gossiping. These methods however, do not consider the topological properties of the network, such as node density, which could be exploited to enhance the performance of the system. This paper proposes a novel aggregation method with which a potential becomes sensitive to the network topology. Our method introduces the notion of affinity spaces, which allow us to uncover the deep connections between the aggregation scope (the radius of the extended neighborhood whose information is aggregated) and the network's Laplacian (which captures the topology of the connectivity graph). Our study provides two additional contributions: (i) It characterizes the convergence of information potentials for static and dynamic networks. Our analysis captures the impact of key parameters, such as node density, time-varying information, as well as of the addition (or removal) of links and nodes. (ii) It shows that information potentials are decomposed into wave-like eigenfunctions that depend on the aggregation scope. This result has important implications, for example it prevents greedy routing techniques from getting stuck by eliminating local-maxima. Simulations and experimental evaluation show that our main findings hold under realistic conditions, with unstable links and message loss.

Energy-efficient Low Power Listening for wireless sensor networks in noisy environments
2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2013
Low Power Listening (LPL) is a common MAC-layer technique for reducing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks, where nodes periodically wakeup to sample the wireless channel to detect activity. However, LPL is highly susceptible to false wakeups caused by environmental noise being detected as activity on the channel, causing nodes to spuriously wakeup in order to receive nonexistent transmissions. In empirical studies in residential environments, we observe that the false wakeup problem can significantly increase a node's duty cycle, compromising the benefit of LPL. We also find that the energy-level threshold used by the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) mechanism to detect channel activity has a significant impact on the false wakeup rate. We then design AEDP, an adaptive energy detection protocol for LPL, which dynamically adjusts a node's CCA threshold to improve network reliability and duty cycle based on application-specified bounds. Empirical experiments in both controlled tests and real-world environments showed AEDP can effectively mitigate the impact of noise on radio duty cycles, while maintaining satisfactory link reliability.

In this paper we present a room-to-room thermal model used to accurately predict temperatures in residential buildings. We evaluate the accuracy of this model with ground truth data from four occupied family homes (two in the UK and two in the US). The homes have differing construction and a range of heating infrastructure (wall-mounted radiators, underfloor heating, and furnace-driven forced-air). Data was gathered using a network of simple and sparse (one per room) temperature sensors, a gas meter sensor, and an outdoor temperature sensor. We show that our model can predict future indoor temperature trends with a 90th percentile aggregate error between 0.61-1.50&#x00B0;C, when given boiler or furnace actuation times and outdoor temperature forecasts. Two existing models were also implemented and then evaluated on our dataset alongside Matchstick. As a proof of concept, we used data from a previous control study to show that when Matchstick is used to predict temperatures (rather than assuming a preset linear heating rate) the possible gas savings increase by up to 3%.

Low power counting via collaborative wireless communications

2013
Metrics that aggregate the state of neighboring nodes are frequently used in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we present two primitives that exploit simultaneous communications in 802.15.4 radios to enable a polling node to calculate with low power the number (or set) of its neighbors where some state predicate of interest holds. In both primitives, the poller assigns transmission powers and response lengths to its respective neighbors for their simultaneous response to each of its poll requests. The two primitives adopt complementary schemes for power assignment such that the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the respective signal from each neighbor is significantly different from that of all others in one primitive and nearly equivalent to that of the others in the other. The first primitive, LinearPoll, suits sparse networks and consumes energy that is linear in the size of its neighborhood, whereas the second primitive, LogPoll, suits dense networks and consumes constant energy. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions that use multiple sub-carriers, our primitives are simpler and more compute-efficient while provide estimation with comparable quality. Compared to single-carrier solutions, our primitives achieve comparable quality at less than half the energy cost or richer information at comparable energy cost. They are also compatible with other radio physical layers. Based on our implementation for CC2420 radios on the TelosB platform, we evaluate the primitives in different wireless environments and neighborhood topologies to study their performance, the tradeoff between their estimation accuracy and energy cost, and methods for tuning their critical parameters, and we compare them with baseline counting protocols.

In-pavement wireless Weigh-In-Motion

Truck weight data is used in many areas of transportation such as weight enforcement and pavement condition assessment. This paper describes a wireless sensor network (WSN) that estimates the weight of moving vehicles from pavement vibrations caused by vehicular motion. The WSN consists of: acceleration sensors that report pavement vibration; vehicle detection sensors that report a vehicle's arrival and departure times; and an access point (AP) that synchronizes all the sensors and records the sensor data. The paper also describes a novel algorithm that estimates a vehicle's weight from pavement vibration and vehicle detection data, and calculates pavement deflection in the process. A prototype of the system has been deployed near a conventional Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) system on I-80 W in Pinole, CA. Weights of 52 trucks at different speeds and loads were estimated by the system under different pavement temperatures and varying environmental conditions, adding to the challenges the system must overcome. The error in load estimates was less than 10% for gross weight and 15% for individual axle weights. Different states have different requirements for WIM but the system described here outperformed the nearby conventional WIM, and meets commonly used standards in United States. The system also opens up exciting new opportunities for WSNs in pavement engineering and intelligent transportation.

The key insight underlying SoNIC is that different interferers disrupt individual 802.15.4 packets in characteristic ways that can be detected by sensor nodes. In contrast to existing approaches to interference detection, SoNIC does not rely on active spectrum sampling or additional hardware, making it lightweight and energy-efficient. In an office environment with multiple interferers, a sensor node running SoNIC correctly detects the predominant interferer 87% of the time. To show how sensor networks can benefit from SoNIC, we add it to a mobile sink application to improve the application's packet reception ratio under interference.

Camazotz: Multimodal activity-based GPS sampling
2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2013
Long-term outdoor localisation with battery-powered devices remains an unsolved challenge, mainly due to the high energy consumption of GPS modules. The use of inertial sensors and short-range radio can reduce reliance on GPS to prolong the operational lifetime of tracking devices, but they only provide coarse-grained control over GPS activity. In this paper, we introduce our feature-rich lightweight Camazotz platform as an enabler of Multimodal Activity-based Localisation (MAL), which detects activities of interest by combining multiple sensor streams for fine-grained control of GPS sampling times. Using the case study of long-term flying fox tracking, we characterise the tracking, connectivity, energy, and activity recognition performance of our module under both static and 3-D mobile scenarios. We use Camazotz to collect empirical flying fox data and illustrate the utility of individual and composite sensor modalities in classifying activity. We evaluate MAL for flying foxes through simulations based on retrospective empirical data. The results show that multimodal activity-based localisation reduces the power consumption over periodic GPS and single sensor-triggered GPS by up to 77% and 14% respectively, and provides a richer event type dissociation for fine-grained control of GPS sampling.

A fresh perspective: Learning to sparsify for detection in massive noisy sensor networks

2013
Can one trade sensor quality for quantity? While larger networks with greater sensor density promise to allow us to use noisier sensors yet measure subtler phenomena, aggregating data and designing decision rules is challenging. Motivated by dense, participatory seismic networks, we seek efficient aggregation methods for event detection. We propose to perform aggregation by sparsification: roughly, a sparsifying basis is a linear transformation that aggregates measurements from groups of sensors that tend to co-activate, and each event is observed by only a few groups of sensors. We show how a simple class of sparsifying bases provably improves detection with noisy binary sensors, even when only qualitative information about the network is available. We then describe how detection can be further improved by learning a better sparsifying basis from network observations or simulations. Learning can be done offline, and makes use of powerful off-the-shelf optimization packages. Our approach outperforms state of the art detectors on real measurements from seismic networks with hundreds of sensors, and on simulated epidemics in the Gnutella P2P communication network.

SCPL: Indoor device-free multi-subject counting and localization using radio signal strength
2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2013
Radio frequency based device-free passive (DfP) localization techniques have shown great potentials in localizing individual human subjects, without requiring them to carry any radio devices. In this study, we extend the DfP technique to count and localize multiple subjects in indoor environments. To address the impact of multipath on indoor radio signals, we adopt a fingerprinting based approach to infer subject locations from observed signal strengths through profiling the environment. When multiple subjects are present, our objective is to use the profiling data collected by a single subject to count and localize multiple subjects without any extra effort. In order to address the non-linearity of the impact of multiple subjects, we propose a successive cancellation based algorithm to iteratively determine the number of subjects. We model indoor human trajectories as a state transition process, exploit indoor human mobility constraints and integrate all information into a conditional random field (CRF) to simultaneously localize multiple subjects. As a result, we call the proposed algorithm SCPL - sequential counting, parallel localizing. We test SCPL with two different indoor settings, one with size 150 m2 and the other 400 m2. In each setting, we have four different subjects, walking around in the deployed areas, sometimes with overlapping trajectories. Through extensive experimental results, we show that SCPL can count the present subjects with 86% counting percentage when their trajectories are not completely overlapping. Our localization algorithms are also highly accurate, with an average localization error distance of 1.3 m.

Volcanic earthquake timing using wireless sensor networks
2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2013
Recent years have witnessed pilot deployments of inexpensive wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for active volcano monitoring. This paper studies the problem of picking arrival times of primary waves (i.e., P-phases) received by seismic sensors, one of the most critical tasks in volcano monitoring. Two fundamental challenges must be addressed. First, it is virtually impossible to download the real-time high-frequency seismic data to a central station for P-phase picking due to limited wireless network bandwidth. Second, accurate P-phase picking is inherently computation-intensive, and is thus prohibitive for many low-power sensor platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a new P-phase picking approach for hierarchical volcano monitoring WSNs where a large number of inexpensive sensors are used to collect fine-grained, real-time seismic signals while a small number of powerful coordinator nodes process collected data and pick accurate P-phases. We develop a suite of new in-network signal processing algorithms for accurate P-phase picking, including lightweight signal pre-processing at sensors, sensor selection at coordinators as well as signal compression and reconstruction algorithms. Testbed experiments and extensive simulations based on real data collected from a volcano show that our approach achieves accurate P-phase picking while only 16% of the sensor data are transmitted.

FixtureFinder: Discovering the existence of electrical and water fixtures

2013
The monitoring of electrical and water fixtures in the home is being applied for a variety of &#x201C;smart home&#x201D; applications, such as recognizing activities of daily living (ADLs) or conserving energy or water usage. Fixture monitoring techniques generally fall into two categories: fixture recognition and fixture disaggregation. However, existing techniques require users to explicitly identify each individual fixture, either by placing a sensor on it or by manually creating training data for it. In this paper, we present a new fixture discovery system that automatically infers the existence of electrical and water fixtures in the home. We call the system FixtureFinder. The basic idea is to use data fusion between the smart meters and other sensors or infrastructure already in the home, such as the home security or automation system, and to find repeating patterns in the fused data stream. To evaluate FixtureFinder, we deployed the system into 4 different homes for 7-10 days of data collection. Our results show that FixtureFinder is able to identify and differentiate major light and water fixtures in less than 10 days, including multiple copies of light bulbs and sinks that have identical power/water profiles.

Strip, Bind, and Search: A method for identifying abnormal energy consumption in buildings

2013
A typical large building contains thousands of sensors, monitoring the HVAC system, lighting, and other operational sub-systems. With the increased push for operational efficiency, operators are relying more on historical data processing to uncover opportunities for energy-savings. However, they are overwhelmed with the deluge of data and seek more efficient ways to identify potential problems. In this paper, we present a new approach called the Strip, Bind and Search (SBS); a method for uncovering abnormal equipment behavior and in-concert usage patterns. SBS uncovers relationships between devices and constructs a model for their usage pattern relative to other devices. It then flags deviations from the model. We run SBS on a set of building sensor traces; each containing hundred sensors reporting data flows over 18 weeks from two separate buildings with fundamentally different infrastructures. We demonstrate that, in many cases, SBS uncovers misbehavior corresponding to inefficient device usage that leads to energy waste. The average waste uncovered is as high as 2500 kWh per device.

Nemo: A high-fidelity noninvasive power meter system for wireless sensor networks

2013
In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Nemo - a practical in situ power metering system for wireless sensor networks. Nemo features a new circuit design called shunt resistor switch that can dynamically adjust the resistance of shunt resistors based on the current load. This allows Nemo to achieve a wide dynamic current range and high measurement accuracy. Nemo transmits real-time power measurements to the host node solely through the power line, by modulating the current load and the supply voltage. This feature leads to a noninvasive, plug &amp; play design that allows Nemo to be easily installed on existing mote platforms without physical wiring or soldering. We have implemented a prototype of Nemo and conducted extensive experimental evaluation. Our results show that Nemo can transmit high-throughput measurement data to the host through voltage/current load modulation. Moreover, it has satisfactory measurement fidelity over a wide range of operating conditions. In particular, Nemo yields a dynamic measurement range of 250,000:1, which is 2.5X and 7X that of two state-of-the-art sensor network power meter systems, while only incurring an average measurement error of 1.34%. We also use a case study to demonstrate that Nemo is able to track the highly dynamic sleep current consumption of TelosB motes, which has important implications for the design of low duty-cycle sensor networks that operate in dynamic environments.

FlockLab: A testbed for distributed, synchronized tracing and profiling of wireless embedded systems

Testbeds are indispensable for debugging and evaluating wireless embedded systems. While existing testbeds provide ample opportunities for realistic, large-scale experiments, they are limited in their ability to closely observe and control the distributed operation of resource-constrained nodes-access to the nodes is restricted to the serial port. This paper presents FlockLab, a testbed that overcomes this limitation by allowing multiple services to run simultaneously and synchronously against all nodes under test in addition to the traditional serial port service: tracing of GPIO pins to record logical events occurring on a node, actuation of GPIO pins to trigger actions on a node, and high-resolution power profiling. FlockLab's accurate timing information in the low microsecond range enables logical events to be correlated with power samples, thus providing a previously unattained level of visibility into the distributed behavior of wireless embedded systems. In this paper, we describe FlockLab's design, benchmark its performance, and demonstrate its capabilities through several real-world test cases.

A comprehensive compiler-assisted thread abstraction for resource-constrained systems
2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2013
While size and complexity of sensor networks software has increased significantly in recent years, the hardware capabilities of sensor nodes have been remaining very constrained. The predominant event-based programming paradigm addresses these hardware constraints, but does not scale well with the growing software complexity, often leading to software that is hard-to-manage and error-prone. Thread abstractions could remedy this situation, but existing solutions in sensor networks either provide incomplete thread semantics or introduce a significant resource overhead. This reflects the common understanding that one has to trade expressiveness for efficiency and vice versa. Our work, however, shows that this trade-off is not inherent to resource-constrained systems. We propose a comprehensive compiler-assisted cooperative threading abstraction, where full-fledged thread-based C code is translated to efficient event-based C code that runs atop an event-based operating system such as Contiki or TinyOS. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms thread libraries and generates code that is almost as efficient as hand-written event-based code with overheads of 1 % RAM, 2 % CPU, and 3 % ROM.

A real-time auto-adjustable smart pillow system for sleep apnea detection and treatment

2013
Sleep apnea, which is a common sleep disorder characterized by the repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep, can result in various diseases, including headaches, hypertension, stroke and cardiac arrest, as well as produce severe consequences such as impaired concentration and traffic accidents. A traditional diagnosis method of sleep apnea is polysomnography, which can only be conducted in sleep center with specialized personals, thus is expensive and inconvenient. Moreover, it is only used for understanding the conditions, without treatment function. Some other methods or devices have been developed to alleviate sleep apnea, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and intraoral mandibular advancement device and surgery. However, they only provide a treatment method without detection or monitoring function. There is no existing device which can provide both apnea detection and treatment functionality. In this paper, we propose and implement a smart phone-based auto-adjustable pillow system, which enables both sleep apnea detection and treatment. Sleep apnea events can be detected in real-time using the blood oxygen sensor, accordingly, the height and shape of the pillow can be automatically adjusted to terminate the sleep apnea event. On the other hand, after the adjustment, the sensor can continuously monitor the blood oxygen signal to evaluate the effectiveness of the pillow adjustment and to help in selecting a suitable adjustment scheme. Therefore, a real-time feedback control system is formed. Besides, compared with existing diagnosis or treatment devices, our system is non-invasive, inexpensive and portable, which can be used at home or during traveling. In this paper, a real-time sleep apnea detection and classification algorithm is proposed to decide whether the pillow should be adjusted or not. We also design a real-time feedback pillow adjustment algorithm, to decide when and how to adjust the pillow and how to evaluate the effectiveness of the adjustment. We conducted experiments on 40 patients, which demonstrate that using our novel smart pillow system, both the sleep apnea duration and the number of sleep apnea events are dramatically reduced by more than 50%.

Autonomous place naming system using opportunistic crowdsensing and knowledge from crowdsourcing
2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2013
A user's location information is commonly used in diverse mobile services, yet providing the actual name or semantic meaning of a place is challenging. Previous works required manual user interventions for place naming, such as searching by additional keywords and/or selecting place in a list. We believe that applying mobile sensing techniques to this problem can greatly reduce user intervention. In this paper, we present an autonomous place naming system using opportunistic crowdsensing and knowledge from crowdsourcing. Our goal is to provide a place name from a person's perspective: that is, functional name (e.g., food place, shopping place), business name (e.g., Starbucks, Apple Store), or personal name (e.g., my home, my workplace). The main idea is to bridge the gap between crowdsensing data from smartphone users and location information in social network services. The proposed system automatically extracts a wide range of semantic features about the places from both crowdsensing data and social networks to model a place name. We then infer the place name by linking the crowdsensing data with knowledge in social networks. Extensive evaluations with real deployments show that the proposed system outperforms the related approaches and greatly reduces user intervention for place naming.

MARS: A Muscle Activity Recognition System enabling self-configuring musculoskeletal sensor networks

2013
Poor posture and incorrect muscle usage are a leading cause of many injuries in sports and fitness. For this reason, non-invasive, fine-grained sensing and monitoring of human motion and muscles is important for mitigating injury and improving fitness efficacy. Current sensing systems either depend on invasive techniques or unscalable approaches whose accuracy is highly dependent on body sensor placement. As a result these systems are not suitable for use in active sports or fitness training where sensing needs to be scalable, accurate and un-inhibitive to the activity being performed. We present MARS, a system that detects both body motion and individual muscle group activity during physical human activity by only using unobtrusive, non-invasive inertial sensors. MARS not only accurately senses and recreates human motion down to the muscles, but also allows for fast personalized system setup by determining the individual identities of the instrumented muscles, obtained with minimal system training. In a real world human study conducted to evaluate MARS, the system achieves greater than 95% accuracy in identifying muscle groups.

Precision ball screw assembly (hereafter called &#x201C;ball screw&#x201D;), as shown in Fig. 1, is a mechanical wear out part that widely used in CNC (computer numerical control) machine tools to control the movement of processing targets and spindles. Up until now, there has been no simple way to directly measure ball screw for knowing the state of wear quantitatively. An indirect approach is logging all the signals (vibration, temperature, and preload change) during the operation of ball screw, and to use them to construct the wear model for estimating its remaining lifetime. To achieve this goal, we proposed a cloud-based logging system in this study that emphasizes (1) logging all the signals during operation in a ball screw's whole lifetime, and transferring to the data server without data loss; and (2) saving all the data into the cloud data storage of the ball screw's manufacturer. The data collected from many ball screws can be used to analyze and construct the wear model of ball screw, allowing the manufacturer to understand the state of wear and send a warning to the tool machine's owner before excessive wear.

To reduce the complexity of scheduling while exploiting the advantages of TDMA-based data collection, we propose TKN-TWN, a token-scheduled multi-channel data collection protocol.

For the reduction of scheduling burden, the TKN-TWN provides topology adaptability while maintaining high throughput in burst data transfer. In this paper, we present the system design of TKN-TWN with enhancement toward topology adaptability based on a previous work. We evaluate TKN-TWN on a local test bed using 31 TelosB sensor nodes. Evaluation results show that the TKN-TWN achieves throughput of 6.4 KByte/s with more than 99% delivery ratio even with occasional node failures.

Human tracking is one of the most important requirements for service mobile robots. Cameras and Laser Ranger Finders (LRFs) are usually used together for human tracking. But these kinds of solutions are too computationally expensive for most embedded processors on these robots as complex computer vision algorithms are needed to process large number of pixels. In this paper, we describe a method combining kinematic measurements from LRF mounted on the robot and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) carried by the target. These two types of sensors can calculate human's velocity and position independently, which are used as information for both indentifying and tracking the target. As pixels observed by LRF and IMU are 1D rather than 2D, our method requires much less computation and memory resources and can be implemented with low-performance embedded processors.

ASWP testbed, a long-term wireless sensor network (WSN) deployment for environmental monitoring, is presented. This testbed integrates 42 MICAz nodes that implement a periodic sampling application for external sensors exposed to a forested nature reserve at the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania (ASWP), USA. It has been running for the past two years using TinyOS-based platforms and the commercially available routing software XMesh. Network performance analysis indicates that the critical impact due to the outdoor environment and node physical failures significantly reduced the network yield when long-term periods were considered. In particular, it is found that an over-used routing path across the network was responsible for most of the packet retransmitted and dropped in ASWP. This preliminary work intends to provide a useful reference point for WSN research and development targeted towards outdoor WSNs for long-term deployments.

Implemented on the Android platform, our SVM simplifies the management of external sensors by abstracting them as virtual sensors to provide the capability of resolving conflicting data requests from multiple applications and also mashing-up sensing data from different sensors to create new customized sensors. We envision our SVM to open the possibilities of designing novel personalized smartphone applications.

First responder applications often require safety surveillance using wireless camera networks [1]. To ensure visual sensing coverage, it is crucial to place optical sensor nodes at proper locations. Under the scenario of energy constrained wireless camera deployment, the issue of communication cost should also be considered. Previous camera deployment research (e.g Art Gallery Problem) mainly concerned sensing coverage. One well-known solution for the art gallery problem is to triangulate the objective polygon and then select vertices to ensure full coverage. However, deploying cameras only in the vertices of polygon may induce inefficiency both in number of necessary cameras and overall communication cost. To reduce the cost, we propose two deployment algorithms: 1) connected visibility region planning algorithm for static deployment given the floor plan is known, and 2) connected visibility region tracking algorithm for the dynamic deployment during the run time. In extensive simulations with real floor plans, our algorithms outperform previous solutions significantly.

This system is characterized by eliminating any need to modify conventional street lamps. Therefore, the cost is extremely low compared to other approaches, e.g., Wireless sensor network for street lamp monitoring. We design a special embedded system, the Hitchhiker, for installation on fixed-route vehicles, such as shuttle buses, to collect illumination readings along the vehicle's route. All data from the Hitchhiker is uploaded to the Google App Engine (GAE) server for data storage, analysis, and user query; this allows identification of possible locations of faulty street lamps on the web-based management interface. We designed and implemented a prototype of the Hitchhiker and GAE server to demonstrate the practicability of this system; we are working toward enabling this design for automatic faulty street lamp detection in the near future.

There is a growing number of examples that use the microphones in phone for various acoustic processing tasks as mobile phones become increasingly computationally powerful. However, there is no general physiological acoustic anomaly detection service on smartphones. To this end, we propose a physiological acoustic anomaly detection service which contains classifiers that can be used to detect irregularity and anomalies in lung sounds and notifies the user. We also present and discuss on some preliminary results.

Poster abstract: Range-based localization in sensor networks: Localizability and accuracy
2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2013
Localizability and accuracy are two fundamental problems in many range-based localization schemes for sensor networks. This poster addresses the two problems theoretically by introducing two new concepts: the effective degree and the lower bound of geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). We prove that the network is not localizable unless the average effective degree is greater than or equal to the dimension of the location space. We further show that the average localization accuracy is approximately inversely proportional to the average degree.

In this paper we present SmartRoad, a crowd-sourced sensing system that detects and identifies traffic regulators, traffic lights and stop signs in particular. As an alternative to expensive road surveys, SmartRoad works on participatory sensing data collected from GPS sensors from in-vehicle smartphones. The resulting traffic regulator information can be used for many assisted-driving or navigation systems. We implement SmartRoad on a vehicular smartphone testbed, and deploy on 35 external volunteer users' vehicles for two months. Experiment results show that SmartRoad can robustly, effectively and efficiently carry out its detection and identification tasks without consuming excessive communication energy/bandwidth or requiring too much ground truth information.

We describe a method of using a network of thermopile sensors distributed along the walls of a room to locate a person within the room. At any given time, a person would be in the view of at least one of the sensor nodes. An algorithm is used to calculate the distance of a person from each sensor node based on its temperature reading and locate the person based on a combination of the sensor readings from the distributed nodes. This method is immune to lighting changes and works even in total darkness. Furthermore, this method of sensing can also detect events such as a person walking past the doorway to a room, lingering outside, and entering or leaving the room.

Fine-grained remote monitoring, control and pre-paid electrical service in rural microgrids
IPSN-14 Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2014
In this paper, we present the architecture, design and experiences from a wirelessly managed microgrid deployment in rural Les Anglais, Haiti. The system consists of a three-tiered architecture with a cloud-based monitoring and control service, a local embedded gateway infrastructure and a mesh network of wireless smart meters deployed at 52 buildings. Each smart meter device has an 802.15.4 radio that enables remote monitoring and control of electrical service. The meters communicate over a scalable multi-hop TDMA network back to a central gateway that manages load within the system. The gateway also provides an 802.11 interface for an on-site operator and a cellular modem connection to a cloud-backend that manages and stores billing and usage data. The cloud backend allows occupants in each home to pre-pay for electricity at a particular peak power limit using a text messaging service. The system activates each meter within seconds and locally enforces power limits with provisioning for theft detection. We believe that this fine-grained micro-payment model can enable sustainable power in otherwise unfeasible areas. This paper provides a chronology of our deployment and installation strategy that involved GPS-based site mapping along with various network conditioning actions required as the network evolved. Finally, we summarize key lessons learned and hypothesis about additional hardware that could be used to ease the tracing of faults like short circuits and downed lines within microgrids.

Aquatic debris monitoring using smartphone-based robotic sensors

Monitoring aquatic debris is of great interest to the ecosystems, marine life, human health, and water transport. This paper presents the design and implementation of SOAR - a vision-based surveillance robot system that integrates an off-the-shelf Android smartphone and a gliding robotic fish for debris monitoring. SOAR features real-time debris detection and coverage-based rotation scheduling algorithms. The image processing algorithms for debris detection are specifically designed to address the unique challenges in aquatic environments. The rotation scheduling algorithm provides effective coverage of sporadic debris arrivals despite camera's limited angular view. Moreover, SOAR is able to dynamically offload computation-intensive processing tasks to the cloud for battery power conservation. We have implemented a SOAR prototype and conducted extensive experimental evaluation. The results show that SOAR can accurately detect debris in the presence of various environment and system dynamics, and the rotation scheduling algorithm enables SOAR to capture debris arrivals with reduced energy consumption.

We explore the feasibility of using commercial aircraft as sensors for observing weather phenomena at a continental scale. We focus specifically on the problem of wind forecasting and explore the use of machine learning and inference methods to harness air and ground speeds reported by aircraft at different locations and altitudes. We validate the learned predictive model with a field study where we release an instrumented high-altitude balloon and compare the predicted trajectory with the sensed winds. The experiments show the promise of using airplane in flight as a large-scale sensor network. Beyond making predictions, we explore the guidance of sensing with value-of-information analyses, where we consider uncertainties and needs of sets of routes and maximize information value in light of the costs of acquiring data from airplanes. The methods can be used to select ideal subsets of planes to serve as sensors and also to evaluate the value of requesting shifts in trajectories of flights for sensing.

Using humans as sensors: An estimation-theoretic perspective
IPSN-14 Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2014
The explosive growth in social network content suggests that the largest &#x201C;sensor network&#x201D; yet might be human. Extending the participatory sensing model, this paper explores the prospect of utilizing social networks as sensor networks, which gives rise to an interesting reliable sensing problem. In this problem, individuals are represented by sensors (data sources) who occasionally make observations about the physical world. These observations may be true or false, and hence are viewed as binary claims. The reliable sensing problem is to determine the correctness of reported observations. From a networked sensing standpoint, what makes this sensing problem formulation different is that, in the case of human participants, not only is the reliability of sources usually unknown but also the original data provenance may be uncertain. Individuals may report observations made by others as their own. The contribution of this paper lies in developing a model that considers the impact of such information sharing on the analytical foundations of reliable sensing, and embed it into a tool called Apollo that uses Twitter as a &#x201C;sensor network&#x201D; for observing events in the physical world. Evaluation, using Twitter-based case-studies, shows good correspondence between observations deemed correct by Apollo and ground truth.

One meter to find them all-water network leak localization using a single flow meter
IPSN-14 Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2014
Leak localization is a major issue faced by water utilities worldwide. Leaks are ideally detected and localized by a network-wide metering infrastructure. However, in many utilities, in-network metering is minimally present at just the inlets of subnetworks called District Metering Area (DMA). We consider the problem of leak localization using data from a single flow meter placed at the inlet of a DMA. We use standard time-series based modeling to detect if a current meter reading is a leak or not, and if so, to estimate the excess flow. Conventional approaches use an a-priori fully calibrated hydraulic model to map the excess flow back to a set of candidate leak locations. However, obtaining an accurate hydraulic model is expensive and hence, beyond the reach of many water utilities. We present an alternate approach that exploits the network structure and static properties in a novel way. Specifically, we extend the use of centrality metrics to infrastructure domains and use these metrics to map from the excess leak flow to the candidate leak location(s). We evaluate our approach on benchmark water utility network topologies as well as on real data obtained from an European water utility. On benchmark topologies, the localization obtained by our method is comparable to that obtained from a complete hydraulic model. On a real-world network, we were able to localize two out of the three leaks whose data we had access to. Of these two cases, we find that the actual leak location was in the candidate set identified by our approach; further, the approach pruned as much as 78% of the DMA locations, indicating a high degree of localization.

Respiratory rate is an important vital sign that can indicate progression of illness but to also predict rapid decline in health. For the purpose, non-contact monitoring systems are becoming more popular due to the self-evident increase in patient comfort. As a cost effective solution for non-invasive breathing monitoring, utilizing the received signal strength measurements of inexpensive transceivers has been proposed. However, the applicability of the available solutions is limited since they rely on numerous sensors. In this work, considerable improvement is made, and a respiratory rate monitoring system based on a single commercial off-the-shelf transmitter-receiver pair is presented. Methods that enable estimation and enhance the accuracy are presented and their effects are evaluated. Moreover, it is empirically demonstrated that the performance of the system is comparable to the accuracy of a high-end device for 3-4 orders of magnitude less price; achieving mean absolute error of 0.12 breaths per minute in the most realistic scenario of the experiments.

Identifying drug (cocaine) intake events from acute physiological response in the presence of free-living physical activity
IPSN-14 Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2014
A variety of health and behavioral states can potentially be inferred from physiological measurements that can now be collected in the natural free-living environment. The major challenge, however, is to develop computational models for automated detection of health events that can work reliably in the natural field environment. In this paper, we develop a physiologically-informed model to automatically detect drug (cocaine) use events in the free-living environment of participants from their electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. The key to reliably detecting drug use events in the field is to incorporate the knowledge of autonomic nervous system (ANS) behavior in the model development so as to decompose the activation effect of cocaine from the natural recovery behavior of the parasympathetic nervous system (after an episode of physical activity). We collect 89 days of data from 9 active drug users in two residential lab environments and 922 days of data from 42 active drug users in the field environment, for a total of 11,283 hours. We develop a model that tracks the natural recovery by the parasympathetic nervous system and then estimates the dampening caused to the recovery by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system due to cocaine. We develop efficient methods to screen and clean the ECG time series data and extract candidate windows to assess for potential drug use. We then apply our model on the recovery segments from these windows. Our model achieves 100% true positive rate while keeping the false positive rate to 0.87/day over (9+ hours/day of) lab data and to 1.13/day over (11+ hours/day of) field data.

TempLab: A testbed infrastructure to study the impact of temperature on wireless sensor networks
IPSN-14 Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2014
Temperature has a strong impact on the operations of all electrical and electronic components. In wireless sensor nodes, temperature variations can lead to loss of synchronization, degradation of the link quality, or early battery depletion, and can therefore affect key network metrics such as throughput, delay, and lifetime. Considering that most outdoor deployments are exposed to strong temperature variations across time and space, a deep understanding of how temperature affects network protocols is fundamental to comprehend flaws in their design and to improve their performance. Existing testbed infrastructures, however, do not allow to systematically study the impact of temperature on wireless sensor networks. In this paper we present TempLab, an extension for wireless sensor network testbeds that allows to control the on-board temperature of sensor nodes and to study the effects of temperature variations on the network performance in a precise and repeatable fashion. TempLab can accurately reproduce traces recorded in outdoor environments with fine granularity, while minimizing the hardware costs and configuration overhead. We use TempLab to analyse the detrimental effects of temperature variations (i) on processing performance, (ii) on a tree routing protocol, and (iii) on CSMA-based MAC protocols, deriving insights that would have not been revealed using existing testbed installations.

RESONATE: Reverberation environment simulation for improved classification of speech models

2014
Home monitoring systems currently gather information about peoples activities of daily living and information regarding emergencies, however they currently lack the ability to track speech. Practical speech analysis solutions are needed to help monitor ongoing conditions such as depression, as the amount of social interaction and vocal affect is important for assessing mood and well-being. Although there are existing solutions that classify the identity and the mood of a speaker, when the acoustic signals are captured in reverberant environments they perform poorly. In this paper, we present a practical reverberation compensation method called RESONATE, which uses simulated room impulse responses to adapt a training corpus for use in multiple real reverberant rooms. We demonstrate that the system creates robust classifiers that perform within 5 - 10% of baseline accuracy of non-reverberant environments. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of this matched condition strategy using a public dataset, and also in controlled experiments with six rooms, and two long-term and uncontrolled real deployments. We offer a practical implementation that performs collection, feature extraction, and classification on-node, and training and simulation of training sets on a base station or cloud service.

2014
This paper presents CSense - a stream-processing toolkit for developing robust and high-rate mobile sensing application in Java. CSense addresses the needs of these systems by providing a new programming model that supports flexible application configuration, a high-level concurrency model, memory management, and compiler analyses and optimizations. Our compiler includes a novel flow analysis that optimizes the exchange of data across components from an application-wide perspective. A mobile sensing application benchmark indicates that flow analysis may reduce CPU utilization by as much as 45%. Static analysis is used to detect a range of programming errors including application composition errors, improper use of memory management, and data races. We identify that memory management and concurrency limit the scalability of stream processing systems. We incorporate memory pools, frame conversion optimizations, and custom synchronization primitives to develop a scalable run-time. CSense is evaluated on Galaxy Nexus phones running Android. Empirical results indicate that our run-time achieves 19 times higher steam processing rate compared to a realistic baseline implementation. We demonstrate the versatility of CSense by developing three mobile sensing applications.

Lightweight map matching for indoor localisation using conditional random fields

2014
Indoor tracking and navigation is a fundamental need for pervasive and context-aware smartphone applications. Although indoor maps are becoming increasingly available, there is no practical and reliable indoor map matching solution available at present. We present MapCraft, a novel, robust and responsive technique that is extremely computationally efficient (running in under 10 ms on an Android smartphone), does not require training in different sites, and tracks well even when presented with very noisy sensor data. Key to our approach is expressing the tracking problem as a conditional random field (CRF), a technique which has had great success in areas such as natural language processing, but has yet to be considered for indoor tracking. Unlike directed graphical models like Hidden Markov Models, CRFs capture arbitrary constraints that express how well observations support state transitions, given map constraints. Extensive experiments in multiple sites show how MapCraft outperforms state-of-the art approaches, demonstrating excellent tracking error and accurate reconstruction of tortuous trajectories with zero training effort. As proof of its robustness, we also demonstrate how it is able to accurately track the position of a user from accelerometer and magnetometer measurements only (i.e. gyro- and WiFi-free). We believe that such an energy-efficient approach will enable always-on background localisation, enabling a new era of location-aware applications to be developed.

While location is one of the most important context information in mobile and ubiquitous computing, large-scale deployment of indoor localization system remains elusive. In this work, we propose PiLoc, an indoor localization system that utilizes opportunistically sensed data contributed by users. Our system does not require manual calibration, prior knowledge and infrastructure support. The key novelty of PiLoc is that it merges walking segments annotated with displacement and signal strength information from users to derive a map of walking paths annotated with radio signal strengths. We evaluate PiLoc over 4 different indoor areas. Evaluation shows that our system can achieve an average localization error of 1.5m.

Energy efficient GPS acquisition with Sparse-GPS

2014
Following rising demands in positioning with GPS, low-cost receivers are becoming widely available; but their energy demands are still too high. For energy efficient GPS sensing in delay-tolerant applications, the possibility of offloading a few milliseconds of raw signal samples and leveraging the greater processing power of the cloud for obtaining a position fix is being actively investigated. In an attempt to reduce the energy cost of this data offloading operation, we propose Sparse-GPS: a new computing framework for GPS acquisition via sparse approximation. Within the framework, GPS signals can be efficiently compressed by random ensembles. The sparse acquisition information, pertaining to the visible satellites that are embedded within these limited measurements, can subsequently be recovered by our proposed representation dictionary. By extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the acquisition quality and energy gains of Sparse-GPS. We show that it is twice as energy efficient than offloading uncompressed data, and has 5-10 times lower energy costs than standalone GPS; with a median positioning accuracy of 40 m.

Optimal sensor placement and measurement of wind for water quality studies in urban reservoirs

2014
We collaborate with environmental scientists to study the hydrodynamics and water quality in an urban district, where the surface wind distribution is an essential input but undergoes high spatial and temporal variations due to the complex urban landform created by surrounding buildings. In this work, we study an optimal sensor placement scheme to measure the wind distribution over a large urban reservoir with a limited number of wind sensors. Unlike existing sensor placement solutions that assume Gaussian process of target phenomena, this study measures the wind which inherently exhibits strong non-Gaussian yearly distribution. By leveraging the local monsoon characteristics of wind, we segment a year into different monsoon seasons which follow a unique distribution respectively. We also use computational fluid dynamics to learn the spatial correlation of wind in the presence of surrounding buildings. The output of sensor placement is a set of the most informative locations to deploy the wind sensors, based on the readings of which we can accurately predict the wind over the entire reservoir surface in real time. 10 wind sensors are finally deployed around or on the water surface of an urban reservoir. The in-field measurement results of more than 3 months suggest that the proposed sensor placement and spatial prediction approach provides accurate wind measurement which outperforms the state-of-the-art Gaussian model based or interpolation based approaches.

Lightweight neighborhood cardinality estimation in dynamic wireless networks

2014
We address the problem of estimating the neighborhood cardinality of nodes in dynamic wireless networks. Different from previous studies, we consider networks with high densities (a hundred neighbors per node) and where all nodes estimate cardinality concurrently. Performing concurrent estimations on dense mobile networks is hard; we need estimators that are not only accurate, but also fast, asynchronous (due to mobility) and lightweight (due to concurrency and high density). To cope with these requirements, we propose Estreme, a neighborhood cardinality estimator with extremely low overhead that leverages the rendezvous time of low-power medium access control (MAC) protocols. We implemented Estreme on the Contiki OS and show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art. With Estreme, 100 nodes can concurrently estimate their neighborhood cardinality with an error of &#x2248;10%. State-of-the-art solutions provide a similar accuracy, but on networks consisting of a few tens of nodes and where only a fraction of nodes estimate the cardinality concurrently.

In this paper, we propose two mechanisms, Power based Counting (Poc) and Power based Identification (Poid), which achieve fast and accurate counting and identification by allowing neighbors to respond simultaneously to a poller. A key observation that motivates our design is that the power of a superposed signal increases with the number of component signals under the condition of constructive interference (CI). However, due to the phase offsets and various hardware limitations (e.g., ADC saturation), the increased superposed power exhibits dynamic and diminishing returns as the number of component signals increases. This uncertainty of phase offsets and diminishing returns property of the superposed power pose serious challenges to the design of both Poc and Poid. To overcome these challenges, we design delay compensation methods to reduce the phase offset of each component signal, and propose a novel probabilistic estimation technique in cooperation with CI. We implement Poc and Poid on a testbed of 1 USRP and 50 TelosB nodes, the experimental results show that the accuracy of Poc is above 97.9%, and the accuracy of Poid is above 96.5% for most cases. In addition to their high accuracy, our methods demonstrate significant advantages over the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of substantially lower energy consumption and estimation delay.

P3: A Practical Packet Pipeline using synchronous transmissions for wireless sensor networks

2014
While high throughput is the key for a number of important applications of sensor networks, performance of the state-of-the-art approach is often poor in practice. This is because if even one of the channels used in its pipeline is bad, the pipeline stalls and throughput degrades significantly. In this paper, we propose a new protocol called P3 (Practical Packet Pipeline) that keeps its packet pipeline flowing despite the quality differences among channels. P3 exploits sender and receiver diversities through synchronous transmissions (constructive interference), involving concurrent transmissions from multiple senders to multiple receivers at every stage of its packet pipeline. To optimize throughput further, P3 uses node grouping to enable the source to transmit in every pipeline cycle, thus fully utilizing the transmission capacity of an underlying radio. Our evaluation results on a 139-node testbed show that P3 achieves an average goodput of 178.5 Kbps while goodput of the state-of-the-art high throughput protocol PIP (Packets In Pipeline) is only 31 Kbps. More interestingly, P3 achieves a minimum goodput of about 149 Kbps, while PIP's goodput reduces to zero in 65% of the cases.

Cyclic network automata and cohomological waves

Following Baryshnikov-Coffman-Kwak [2], we use cyclic network automata (CNA) to generate a decentralized protocol for dynamic coverage problems in a sensor network, with only a small fraction of sensors awake at every moment. This paper gives a rigorous analysis of CNA and shows that waves of awake-state nodes automatically solve pusuit/evasion-type problems without centralized coordination. As a corollary of this work, we unearth some interesting topological interpretations of features previously observed in cyclic cellular automata (CCA). By considering CCA over networks and completing to simplicial complexes, we induce dynamics on the higher-dimensional complex. In this setting, waves are seen to be generated by topological defects with a nontrivial degree (or winding number). The simplicial complex has the topological type of the underlying map of the workspace (a subset of the plane), and the resulting waves can be classified cohomologically. This allows one to &#x201C;program&#x201D; pulses in the sensor network according to cohomology class. We give a realization theorem for such pulse waves.

SIPS: Solar Irradiance Prediction System

There is high interest in up-scaling capacities of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. However, variability and uncertainty in power output is a major concern and forecasting is, therefore, a top priority. Advancements in forecasting can potentially limit the impact of fluctuations in solar power generation, specifically in cloudy days when the variability and dynamics are the largest. We propose SIPS, Solar Irradiance Prediction System, a novel sensing infrastructure using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to enable sensing of solar irradiance for solar power generation forecasting. In this paper, we report the findings of a deployment of a hierarchical WSN system consisting of 19 TelosB nodes equipped with solar irradiance sensors, and 5 MicaZ nodes equipped with GPS boards, deployed in the vicinity of a 1 MW solar array. We evaluate different irradiance sensor types and the performance of different novel prediction methods using SIPS' data and show that the spatial-temporal cross-correlations between sensor node readings and solar array output power exists and can be exploited to improve prediction accuracy. Using this data for short-term solar forecasting for cloudy days with very high dynamics in solar output power generation - the worst case scenario for prediction-, we get an average of 97.24% accuracy in our prediction for short time horizon forecasting and 240% reduction of predicted normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) compared to state-of-the-art methods that do not use SIPS data.

Face recognition on smartphones via optimised Sparse Representation Classification
IPSN-14 Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2014
Face recognition is an element of many smartphone apps, e.g. face unlocking, people tagging and games. Sparse Representation Classification (SRC) is a state-of-the-art face recognition algorithm, which has been shown to outperform many classical face recognition algorithms in OpenCV. The success of SRC is due to its use of &#x2113;<sub>1</sub> optimisation, which makes SRC robust to noise and occlusions. Since &#x2113;<sub>1</sub> optimisation is computationally intensive, SRC uses random projection matrices to reduce the dimension of the &#x2113;<sub>1</sub> problem. However, random projection matrices do not give consistent classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method to optimise the projection matrix for &#x2113;<sub>1</sub>-based classification1. Our evaluations, based on publicly available databases and real experiment, show that face recognition based on the optimised projection matrix can be 5-17% more accurate than its random counterpart and OpenCV algorithms. Furthermore, the optimised projection matrix does not have to be re-calculated even if new faces are added to the training set. We implement the SRC with optimised projection matrix on Android smartphones and find that the computation of residuals in SRC is a severe bottleneck, taking up 85-90% of the computation time. To address this problem, we propose a method to compute the residuals approximately, which is 50 times faster but without sacrificing recognition accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the feasibility of our new algorithm by the implementation and evaluation of a new face unlocking app and show its robustness to variation to poses, facial expressions, lighting changes and occlusions.

Visual light landmarks for mobile devices

The omnipresence of indoor lighting makes it an ideal vehicle for pervasive communication with mobile devices. In this paper, we present a communication scheme that enables interior ambient LED lighting systems to send data to mobile devices using either cameras or light sensors. By exploiting rolling shutter camera sensors that are common on tablets, laptops and smartphones, it is possible to detect high-frequency changes in light intensity reflected off of surfaces and in direct line-of-sight of the camera. We present a demodulation approach that allows smartphones to accurately detect frequencies as high as 8kHz with 0.2kHz channel separation. In order to avoid humanly perceivable flicker in the lighting, our system operates at frequencies above 2kHz and compensates for the non-ideal frequency response of standard LED drivers by adjusting the light's duty-cycle. By modulating the PWM signal commonly used to drive LED lighting systems, we are able to encode data that can be used as localization landmarks. We show through experiments how a binary frequency shift keying modulation scheme can be used to transmit data at 1.25 bytes per second (fast enough to send an ID code) from up to 29 unique light sources simultaneously in a single collision domain. We also show how tags can demodulate the same signals using a light sensor instead of a camera for low-power applications.

Time-of-flight echo techniques have been proposed to estimate the distance between a local and a target station over regular WiFi radio devices. Their current main shortcoming is that they are affected by severe noise components at both stations. Our aim in this work is to quantify the noise level introduced by the target in order to derive practical limits of the ranging accuracy achievable using off-the-shelf devices. For this purpose, we develop a low-noise experimental platform which allows us to measure the echo-reply delay with very high accuracy. Our preliminary results with two popular chipsets from different manufacturers show that the median echo-reply delay at the target is never equal to the nominal SIFS value, and it deviates by approximately 10-20 ns over time, suggesting a practical ranging accuracy limit of 3 m.

Central to MaWi is a novel framework combining two self-contained but complementary localization techniques: Wi-Fi and Ambient Magnetic Field. Combining the two techniques, MaWi not only achieves a high localization accuracy, but also effectively reduces human labor in building fingerprint databases: to avoid war-driving, MaWi is designed to work with low quality fingerprint databases that can be efficiently built by only one person. Our experiments demonstrate that MaWi, with a fingerprint database as scarce as one data sample at each spot, outperforms the state-of-the-art proposals working on a richer fingerprint database.

This article describes a machine learning approach to water level estimation in a dual ultrasonic/passive infrared urban flood sensor system. We first show that an ultrasonic rangefinder alone is unable to accurately measure the level of water on a road due to thermal effects. Using additional passive infrared sensors, we show that ground temperature and local sensor temperature measurements are sufficient to correct the rangefinder readings and improve the flood detection performance. Since floods occur very rarely, we use a supervised learning approach to estimate the correction to the ultrasonic rangefinder caused by temperature fluctuations. Preliminary data shows that water level can be estimated with an absolute error of less than 2 cm.

2014
Device-free localization (DFL) plays an important role in many applications, such as the intrusion detection. Most traditional DFL systems assume a fixed distribution of the received signal strength (RSS) changes even they are distorted by different types of targets. It inevitably causes the localization to fail if the targets for modeling and testing belong to different categories. We propose a transferring scheme for DFL, which employs a rigorously designed transferring function to transfer the distorted RSS changes across different categories of targets into a latent feature space, where the distributions of the distorted RSS changes from different categories of targets are unified. A benefit of this approach is that the same transferred localization models can be shared by different categories of targets, leading to a substantial reduction of the human efforts. The results of experiments illustrate the efficacy of our transferring scheme.

We present eNav, a smartphone-based vehicular GPS navigation system that has an energy-saving location sensing mode capable of drastically reducing navigation energy needs. Traditional implementations sample the phone GPS at the highest possible rate (usually 1Hz) to ensure constant highest possible localization accuracy. This practice results in excessive phone battery consumption and reduces the attainable length of a navigation session. The seemingly most common solution would be to always use a car-charger and keep the phone plugged-in during navigation at all times. However, according to a comprehensive survey we conducted, only a small percent of people would actually always carry around their phones' car-chargers and cables, as doing so is inconvenient and defeats the true &#x201C;wireless&#x201D; nature of mobile phones. In addressing this problem, eNav exploits the phone's lower-energy on-board motion sensors for approximate location sensing when the vehicle is sufficiently far from the next navigation waypoint, using actual GPS sampling only when close. Our user study shows that, while remaining virtually transparent to users, eNav can reduce navigation energy consumption by over 80% without compromising navigation quality or user experience.

PiMiair.org is a participatory indoor air quality data sharing project we launched in January 2014. Over 200 PiMi air boxes, a low-cost indoor air quality monitor, were given out to volunteer users across China. The PiMi air boxes measure the approximate indoor particulate matter concentration, and the ambient temperate and humidity. When a user accesses the PiMi air box for his personal air quality data on his smartphone, the data is relayed to the backend PiMi cloud server for analysis. Accumulating large amount of indoor air quality data under different circumstances, the PiMi cloud server is able to use statistical learning methodologies to detect point of interests (POIs) in the data series, and asks users to label their activities or events at the POIs. Together with the user-reported physicality information on the indoor environments, PiMiair.org is able to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of the environment physicality and human behaviors on the indoor air quality, and mine the knowledges on how to alleviate indoor air pollution. We believe that by sharing these knowledge among the community, healthier breathing environments could be nurtured for the well-being of the public.

This poster is aimed at solving the problem of maximizing the energy margin of a solar-powered sensor network at a fixed time horizon, to maximize the network performance during an event to monitor. Using a game theoretic approach, the optimal routing maximizing the energy margin of the network at a given time under solar power forcing can be computed in a decentralized way and solved exactly through dynamic programming with a low overall complexity. We also show that this decentralized algorithm is simple enough to be implemented on practical sensor nodes. Such an algorithm would be very useful whenever the energy margin of a solar-powered sensor network has to be maximized at a specific time.

Visible light communication over LCD/camera links offers a potential complement to traditional RF communication technology such as WiFi or cellular networks. However, the heterogeneity in receivers (e.g., mobile phone cameras) presents a challenge because the receivers differ widely in resolution, distance to the transmitter (LCD), and other factors, and therefore they differ in channel quality. We are researching a communication scheme in which each receiver can decode as much data from an LCD's transmission as the receiver's channel supports. The core idea is to encode the payload into an image's frequency representation rather than directly into pixels. We have successfully transmitted data using a prototype implementation and are currently investigating appropriate channel models.

Most previous Device-free Passive Localization (DFL) methods are learning based and they assume the distribution of Received Radio Signal (RSS) distorted by an object is fixed across time. However, the signals significantly vary over time and the pre-obtained radio map (or prior knowledge) outdated in the localization phase, thus causing the localization accuracy decrease. To cope with this problem, this poster proposes, EIL, an environment-independent DFL approach which can improve the system robustness and localization accuracy by eliminating the interference of environment on RSS over time in both the training phase and the localization phase. Through both the extensive experiments and simulations, EIL keeps a range of 0.5m to 0.6m localization errors for 90% locations over time.

Stuttering is a very complex speech disorder that affects around 0.7% of adults while around 5% of the population have stuttered at some point. A large percentage of the affected people tend to speak more fluently when their own speech is played back to their ear with some type of alteration. While this has been done with special devices, smartphones can be used for this purpose. We report on our initial experiences on building such an application and demonstrate problems with delay caused by the lack of real-time support for audio playback in the Android operating system. We also discuss ideas for future work to improve app support for people who stutter.

The hardware specification is expressed in BIP, a language for describing easily complex interacting discrete components. The analysis of the joint behavior of the application and the hardware specification is then performed using the theory of Abstract Interpretation. We have done a set of experiments on some TinyOS applications. Encouraging results are obtained that confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

Several concurrent applications running on a sensor network may cause a node to transmit packets at distinct periods, which increases the radio-switching rate and has significant impact in terms of the overall energy consumption. We propose to batch the transmissions together by defining a harmonizing period to align the transmissions from multiple applications at periodic boundaries. This harmonizing period is then leveraged to design a distributed protocol called Network-Harmonized Scheduling (NHS) that coordinates transmissions across nodes and provides real-time guarantees in a multi-hop network.

This poster describes the information funnel, a data collection protocol for social sensing that maximizes a measure of delivered information utility. We argue that information-centric networking (ICN), where data objects are named instead of hosts, is especially suited for utility-maximizing transport in resource-constrained environments, because data names can expose similarities between named objects that can be leveraged for minimizing redundancy, hence maximizing utility. We implement the funnel on the recently proposed named-data networking (NDN) stack, an instance of ICN. With proper name space design, a protocol prioritizes transmission of data items over bottlenecks to maximize information utility, with very weak assumptions on the utility function. This prioritization is achieved merely by comparing data names, without knowing application-level name semantics, which makes it generalizable across a wide range of applications. Evaluation results show the information funnel improves the utility of the collected data objects compared with state-of-the-art solutions.

While device-free localization (DFL), i.e., target without carrying any devices, is attractive, the need for a significant degree of pre-deployment effort is a key challenge. In this paper, we proposed the NDP method, which do not assume knowledge of the placement layout, including the parameters of the transceivers. The key intuition is that all of the distorted wireless signals caused by the target, even the many from unknown transceivers, are constrained the presence of the target(s). Despite the absence of any explicit pre-deployment calibration, NDP yields a 80th percentile error of 1.8m which is much butter than the 6.2m, 5.8m and 5m yielded by the three state-of-the-art algorithms from prior work.

2014
Bulk data transmission is an important traffic pattern of many sensor network applications. These applications deliver large amounts of sensed data to a sink node for further processing. Most of the existing bulk data transmission protocols use a single flow of communication. This is inefficient as the radio at the source node is transmitting and the sink node is receiving packets for only half of the duration of the burst. We show in this paper that reduced contention because of directional communication enables us to construct node disjoint paths from the source to the sink node using only one wireless channel. This allows us to forward subsequent packets in the burst on the disjoint paths which maximises the radio transmit and receive time at the source and the sink node respectively. We demonstrate that this doubles the sink throughput as compared to a single flow of communication.

We demonstrate a solution to this problem in the form of a cloud-based emulation platform called CrowdMeter. Our platform emulates mobile devices and access network links, models human factors in crowd-sensing, and leverages virtualization through cloud infrastructure-as-service resources to model large scale crowd-sensing. In this demo we exhibit the capabilities of CrowdMeter by deploying VideoQuest, a simple crowd-sensing application, on hundreds of emulated mobile devices, and by measuring its performance.

The future of air traffic control (ATC) will heavily depend on the Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol as a crucial component. ADS-B marks a paradigm change in airspace monitoring as global ATC is switching from an independent, radar-based approach to dependent, satellite-supported surveillance. With ADS-B, aircraft broadcast their own position and other information in short periodic messages to other aircraft and control stations on the ground. As the protocol is becoming mandatory in most airspaces over the next years, it is important that its characteristics and challenges are thoroughly investigated. The large-scale ADS-B data required to do this has not been openly accessible until now, as specialized and expensive infrastructure was needed. We demonstrate OpenSky, a sensor network based on low-cost hardware connected over the Internet, which enables real-world experimental studies. OpenSky works with off-the-shelf sensors run by volunteers distributed over Central Europe. Currently comprising 11 sensors, the sensor network covers an area of 720,000 km2. We capture more than 30% of Europe's commercial air traffic, offering access to billions of ADS-B messages.

The accurate measurement of airflow patterns at high spatial and temporal resolutions is of great importance for building design and operation. Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology can be used to develop miniaturized airflow sensors capable of detecting both airflow speed and direction at high temporal resolution. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used extensively for large-scale monitoring at high spatial resolution.

Ultra-fine particles with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 microns, namely Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5), are capable of penetrating the lung cells and circulating the circulatory system, and compose a major health threat to people. Although the government is publishing the outdoor PM2.5 concentration on an hourly basis, the indoor PM 2.5 concentration, to which most people expose for most of their everyday life time, remains unsupervised. The high cost of the professional PM 2.5 measuring equipments, which utilize filtering and direct mass measuring methodology, prevents the indoor air quality to be monitored pervasively. We designed and implemented PiMi air box, a cost-effective portable sensor, which is able to estimate the PM 2.5 mass concentration with satisfactory accuracy. The PiMi air boxes adopt the low-cost optical particle counting technology and convert the particle counts into PM 2.5 mass concentration via empirical diameter-distribution and density of particulate matters. The errors introduced by the individuality of the low-cost particle counters are offset during a machine-learning-based calibration procedure for each single unit. The PiMi air box enjoys a stunning cost reduction by a factor of 1,000 comparing to professional equipments, and still maintains an satisfactory level of accuracy for everyday life air quality measurement. Together with embedded Bluetooth connectivity and SmartPhone APPs, PiMi air box is well-suited for massive crowd-sourced indoor air-quality monitoring research.

Manufacturers announce on a regular basis the availability of novel tiny devices, most of them featuring network interfaces: the Internet of Things (IoT) is already here - from the hardware perspective. On the software side however, embedded platforms available so far made it uneasy for developers to build apps that run across heterogeneous IoT hardware. Linux does not scale down to small, energy-constrained devices, while alternatives such as Contiki yield a steep learning curve and lengthy development life-cycles because they rule out standard programming and debugging tools. RIOT is a new open source software platform bridging this gap. RIOT allows just about any programmer to develop IoT application with zero learning curve. This is achieved by allowing standard C and C++ application programming with multi-threading, using well-known debugging tools (gdb, Valgrind, profilers etc.), while requiring only a minimum of 1.5 kB of RAM. RIOT also provides built-in energy efficiency and real-time capabilities. These characteristics make this platform attractive in several contexts, including teaching in the field of the Internet of Things, and experimental research in the domain of sensor networks and the IoT.

Detailed breakdowns of household energy consumption allow occupants to better understand their energy usage patterns and identify opportunities for energy savings. Current solutions are costly, invasive, and difficult to maintain. Sub-metering approaches rely on - and are hindered by - complex hardware. To address these problems, we demonstrate a sub-metering system that can estimate the power draw of individual loads by augmenting aggregate measurements with very simple sensors. These sensors wake up at a frequency proportional to the power draw of a neighboring load, and report these wakeups to a central server. We model the relationship between each sensor's wakeup frequency and the load's power draw as a monotonically increasing polynomial. We calibrate each sensor's function by constructing a linear least squares problem that allows us to discover the set of polynomial coefficients that minimize the difference between the estimated power draw and the power draw as derived from the aggregate measurements. After calibration, we can convert sensor wakeup frequencies to power draw in real time. This systems approach to sub-metering results in deployments that are easy to install and maintain, allowing users to gain a broad yet detailed view of their energy consumption and costs.

We demonstrate a Visual Light Communication (VLC) system [1] that enables LED lighting luminaires to communicate with cameras on mobile devices. Each LED pulses at a frequency above the humanly perceivable flicker threshold where cameras and photodiodes can still detect changes in light intensity. Our modulation scheme supports multiple light sources in a single collision domain, and works for both, line-of-sight (LOS) operation as well as from reflected surfaces like those found in architectural lighting. The spatial confinement of light makes this system ideal for use as localization landmarks. Our demonstration includes four LED ambient lights acting as location landmarks transmitting modulated data. A mobile device receiving and processing the signal displays the ID and RSSI of the closest landmark. Interacting with the system will allow users to see the practical effects of multiple-access, frequency of operation, distance from the lights, camera parameters and camera motion.

Motion capture plays an important role in interactive gaming, animation, film industry and navigation. The existing camera-based motion capture studios are expensive and require a clear line of sight; hence they cannot be applied to ubiquitous applications. With the rapid development of low-cost MEMS sensors and sensor fusion techniques, the inertial sensor based motion capture systems are attracting a lot of attention because of the seamless deployment, low system cost and the comparable accuracy they provide.

Accurate Power Quality Monitoring in Microgrids
2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2016
Traditional power grid is not resistant to severe weather conditions, especially in remote areas. For some areas with few people, such as islands, it is difficult and expensive to maintain their connectivity to the traditional power grid. Therefore, a self-sustainable microgrid is desired. However, given the limited local energy storage and energy generation, it is extremely challenging for a microgrid to balance the power demand and generation in real-time. To realize the real-time power quality monitoring, the power quality information of microgrid, such as voltage, frequency and phase angle in each home, needs to be collected in real- time. Furthermore, the unreliable sensing results and data collection in a microgrid make the real-time data collection more difficult. To address these challenges, we designed an accurate real-time power quality data sensing hardware to sense the voltage, frequency and phase angle in each home. A novel data management technique is also proposed to reconstruct the missing data caused by unreliable sensing. We implemented our system over off-the-shelf smartphones with a few peripheral hardware components, and realized an accuracy of 1.7 mHz and 0.01 rad for frequency and phase angle monitoring, respectively. We also show our data management technique can reconstruct the missing data with more than 99% accuracy.

Burnout: A Wearable System for Unobtrusive Skeletal Muscle Fatigue Estimation
2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2016
Skeletal muscles are pivotal for sports and exercise. However, overexertion of skeletal muscles causes muscle fatigue which can lead to injury. Consequently, understanding skeletal muscle fatigue is important for injury prevention. Current ways to estimate exhaustion revolve around self-estimation or inference from such sensors as force sensors, electromyography e.t.c. These methods are not always reliable, especially during isotonic exercises. Toward this end, we present Burnout - a wearable system for quantifying skeletal muscle fatigue in an exercise setting. Burnout uses accelerometers to sense skeletal muscle vibrations. From these vibrations, Burnout obtains a region based feature (R- Feature), in the case of this work, the region mean power frequency (R-MPF) gradient to correlate the sensed vibrations to a known ground truth measure of skeletal muscle fatigue, i.e., Dimitrov's spectral fatigue index gradient. We evaluate Burnout on the biceps and quadriceps of 5 healthy participants through four different exercises, collected in a real world environment. Our results show that by using this R-MPF feature on our real world data set, Burnout is able to reduce the error of estimating the ground truth fatigue index gradient by up to 50% on average compared to using the standard MPF feature.

Characterizing the Accuracy of a Self-Synchronized Reverse-GPS Wildlife Localization System

2016
We characterize the accuracy of a wildlife localization system that is based on the reverse-GPS or time-of-arrival (TOA) principle, in which radio receivers at known locations collaborate to determine the location of a transmitter attached to a wild animal. We describe the system in detail and show that it produces accurate location estimates in real settings and over long periods of time. Localization errors of wild animals carrying our transmitters have standard deviation of about 5m and mean of 5-15m. If we restrict the system to operate in the center of the receiver's band-pass filters, the mean error drops to about 5m. We also show how to reliably quantify the error in each individual location estimate. In addition to the characterization of accuracy, we introduce three technical innovations in the system. First, a method to model the error of individual time-of- arrival measurements, enabling correct weighing of the data to estimate locations and allowing estimation of the covariance matrix of each location estimate. Second, extensive use of known- position beacon transmitters, to synchronize the clocks of receivers (radio-frequency TOA localization require accurate clocks), to characterize and continuously monitor the performance of the system, and to model arrival- time-estimation errors. Third, we estimate the covariance matrix of each localization.

CrossZig: Combating Cross-Technology Interference in Low-Power Wireless Networks

2016
Low-power wireless devices suffer notoriously from Cross- Technology Interference (CTI). To enable co-existence, researchers have proposed a variety of interference mitigation strategies. Existing solutions, however, are designed to work with the limitations of currently available radio chips. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit physical layer properties of 802.15.4 signals to better address CTI. We present CrossZig, a cross-layer solution that takes advantage of physical layer information and processing to improve low-power communication under CTI. To this end, CrossZig utilizes physical layer information to detect presence of CTI in a corrupted packet and to apply an adaptive packet recovery which incorporates a novel cross-layer based packet merging and an adaptive FEC coding. We implement a prototype of CrossZig for the low-power IEEE 802.15.4 in a software-defined radio platform. We show the adaptability and the performance gain of CrossZig through experimental evaluation considering both micro-benchmarking and system performance under various interference patterns.

DeepX: A Software Accelerator for Low-Power Deep Learning Inference on Mobile Devices

2016
Breakthroughs from the field of deep learning are radically changing how sensor data are interpreted to extract the high-level information needed by mobile apps. It is critical that the gains in inference accuracy that deep models afford become embedded in future generations of mobile apps. In this work, we present the design and implementation of DeepX, a software accelerator for deep learning execution. DeepX signif- icantly lowers the device resources (viz. memory, computation, energy) required by deep learning that currently act as a severe bottleneck to mobile adoption. The foundation of DeepX is a pair of resource control algorithms, designed for the inference stage of deep learning, that: (1) decompose monolithic deep model network architectures into unit- blocks of various types, that are then more efficiently executed by heterogeneous local device processors (e.g., GPUs, CPUs); and (2), perform principled resource scaling that adjusts the architecture of deep models to shape the overhead each unit-blocks introduces. Experiments show, DeepX can allow even large-scale deep learning models to execute efficently on modern mobile processors and significantly outperform existing solutions, such as cloud-based offloading.

It is widely known that cross-technology interference (CTI) adversely affects the reliability of 802.15.4 (ZigBee) communications. With the 2.4 GHz ISM band getting increasingly congested because of multiple wireless technologies like IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), 802.16 (WiMax), and Bluetooth and common appliances like a microwave and a cordless phone sharing it, data collection becomes exceedingly challenging especially in unplanned CTI prevalent in urban environments. This demonstration presents Oppcast, a robust and energy-efficient data collection protocol which carefully exploits a combination of spatial and channel diversity to eliminate the need for performing expensive channel estimation in advance. By exploiting multiple routes over multiple channels, packets can be reliably communicated to the sink even in severely interfered environments.

Internet of Things (IoT) application development is technically challenging and complex due to several factors such as the presence of different IoT protocols, interoperability issues, lack of industry standards and dealing with the heterogeneity that exists both in Physical and Internet worlds. Furthermore, developers involved in the IoT application development have to address issues pertaining to different life-cycles ranging from design, implementation to deployment (deployment complexities due to the possibilities of wide range of devices). Manual effort involved in all above three phases for heterogeneous devices is a time-consuming and error-prone process. We demonstrate IoTSuite which is an application development platform consisting of a suite of tools motivated by the need to simplify IoT application development. The IoTSuite supports several features such as automatic code generation and integration with a set of modeling languages. It takes high-level specification as input that abstract heterogeneity related complexity. It integrates compiler and deployment module to provide automation at different phases of application development process.

OpenVLC (www.openvlc.org) is an open-source project for research in Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems. It has the potential to help create a new type of infrastructure, an Internet of Lights (IoL), where LED- based devices (e.g., car lights, city lights, billboards, toy, etc) and photodetectors become inter- connected. OpenVLC is built upon an embedded platform and adopts off-the-shelf optical devices and essential electronic components. It has been proved to be a starter kit for VLC research, thanks to its deployments by tens of top universities/research centers in the world (www.openvlc.org/list-of-users.html). This demo introduces its latest version: OpenVLC1.1. The new features include: (1) higher resilience to ambient light noise, e.g., indoor interfering lighting; (2) interface for sensor application. A new board (OpenVLC1.1 cape) is designed and the printed circuit is developed. The cape is plugged directly into the main embedded board and external sensors can be easily connected to the cape.

Frame Counter: Achieving Accurate and Real-Time Link Estimation in Low Power Wireless Sensor Networks
2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2016
Link estimation is a fundamental component of forwarding protocols in wireless sensor networks. In low power forwarding, however, the asynchronous nature of widely adopted duty-cycled radio control brings new challenges to achieve accurate and real- time estimation. First, the repeatedly transmitted frames (called wake-up frame) increase the complexity of accurate statistic, especially with bursty channel contention and coexistent interference. Second, frequent update of every link status exhausts the limited energy supply due to long duration of beacon broadcast. In this paper, we propose meter (Distributed Frame Counter), which takes the opportunities of link overhearing to update link status in real time. Furthermore, meter does not only depend on counting the successfully decoded wake-up frames, but also counts the corrupted ones by exploiting the feasibility of ZigBee identification based on short-term sequence of the received signal strength. We implement meter in TinyOS and further evaluate the performance through extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor testbeds. The results demonstrate that meter can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art link estimation schemes.

Generic Route Repair: Augmenting Wireless Ad Hoc Sensor Networks for Local Connectivity

Routes in a wireless network can be repaired reactively after node failures by broadcasting the message across the neighborhood of the failed node. This broadcast problem is easily solvable, if the neighborhood of every node in the network induces a connected subgraph of the communication graph. Graphs with this property are called locally connected. This paper considers the edge augmentation problem for undirected graphs G = (V, E) that asks for a minimum set E' of additional edges such that the neighborhoods defined by G induce connected subgraphs of the augmented graph G' = (V, E&#x222A;E'). We develop a practical approximation algorithm with an approximation factor of 1 + ln (|V|) for general graphs and a constant approximation factor for several special cases such as unit disk graphs (factor 3/2), d-quasi unit disk graphs having d &#x2265; &#x221A;3-1 &#x2248; 0.732 (factor 11/6) or graphs with a constant maximum vertex degree. Additionally we prove the NP-completeness of the augmentation problem above and the related augmentation problem that asks for a locally connected graph.

Harmonium: Asymmetric, Bandstitched UWB for Fast, Accurate, and Robust Indoor Localization

2016
We introduce Harmonium, a novel ultra-wideband RF localization architecture that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors. Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates. Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive, lightweight, and FCC-compliant ultra-wideband transmitter or tag, fixed infrastructure anchors with known locations, and centralized processing that calculates the tag's position. Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that rejects narrowband interferers and extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of traditional ultra-wideband approaches. In a complex indoor environment, 90% of position estimates obtained with Harmonium exhibit less than 31 cm of error with an average 9 cm of inter-sample noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e. through-wall), 90% of position error is less than 42 cm. The tag draws 75 mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9 mJ per location fix at the 19 Hz update rate. Tags weigh 3 g and cost $4.50 USD at modest volumes. Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors, devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture systems.

HB-Phone: A Bed-Mounted Geophone-Based Heartbeat Monitoring System

2016
Heartbeat monitoring during sleep is critically important to ensuring the well-being of many people, ranging from patients to elderly. Technologies that support heartbeat monitoring should be unobtrusive, and thus solutions that are accurate and can be easily applied to existing beds is an important need that has been unfulfilled. We tackle the challenge of accurate, low-cost and easy to deploy heartbeat monitoring by investigating whether off-the- shelf analog geophone sensors can be used to detect heartbeats when installed under a bed. Geophones have the desirable property of being insensitive to lower-frequency movements, which lends itself to heartbeat monitoring as the heartbeat signal has harmonic frequencies that are easily captured by the geophone. At the same time, lower-frequency movements such as respiration, can be naturally filtered out by the geophone. With carefully-designed signal processing algorithms, we show it is possible to detect and extract heartbeats in the presence of environmental noise and other body movements a person may have during sleep. We have built a prototype sensor and conducted detailed experiments that involve 43 subjects (with IRB approval), which demonstrate that the geophone sensor is a compelling solution to long-term at-home heartbeat monitoring. We compared the average heartbeat rate estimated by our prototype and that reported by a pulse oximeter. The results revealed that the average error rate is around 1.30% over 500 data samples when the subjects were still on the bed, and 3.87% over 300 data samples when the subjects had different types of body movements while lying on the bed. We also deployed the prototype in the homes of 9 subjects for a total of 25 nights, and found that the average estimation error rate was 8.25% over more than 181 hours' data.

HeadScan: A Wearable System for Radio-Based Sensing of Head and Mouth-Related Activities

2016
The popularity of wearables continues to rise. However, their functionalities and applications are constrained by the types of sensors that are currently available. Accelerometers and gyroscopes struggle to capture complex user activities. Microphones and image sensors are more powerful but capture privacy sensitive information. Physiological sensors are obtrusive to users since they often require skin contact and must be placed at certain body positions to function. In contrast, radio- based sensing uses wireless radio signals to capture movements of different parts of body caused by human activities and therefore provides a contactless and privacy-preserving approach to detect and monitor human activities. In this paper, we contribute to the search for a new sensing modality for the next generation of wearable devices by exploring the feasibility of radio-based human activity sensing and recognition in the context of wearable setting. We envision radio-based sensing has the potential to fundamentally transform wearables as we currently know them. As the first step to achieve our vision, we have designed and developed HeadScan, a first- of-its-kind wearable for radio-based sensing of a number of human activities that involve head and mouth movements. HeadScan only requires a pair of small antennas placed on the shoulder and collar and one wearable unit worn on the arm or the belt of the user. HeadScan uses the fine-grained CSI measurements extracted from the radio signals and incorporates a radio signal processing pipeline that converts the raw CSI measurements into the targeted human activities. To examine the feasibility and performance of HeadScan, we have collected about 50.5 hours data from seven users. Our wide-range experiments including comparisons to a conventional skin-contact audio-based sensing approach to tracking the same set of head and mouth-related activities highlight the enormous potential of our radio-based sensing approach and provide guidance to future explorations.

Highly Reliable Signal Strength-Based Boundary Crossing Localization in Outdoor Time-Varying Environments

2016
Detecting and locating outdoor border crossing events is valuable information in curbing drug trafficking, reducing poaching, and protecting high-asset equipment and goods. However, border sensing is notoriously challenging, prone to false alarms and missed detections, with serious consequences. Weather events, like rain and wind, make it even more challenging to maintain a low level of missed detections and false alarms. In this paper, we propose and test an automated system of wireless sensors which uses received signal strength (RSS) measurements to localize where a border crossing occurs. In addition, we develop new RSS-based statistical models and methods that can quickly be initialized and updated by using link RSS statistics to adapt to time-varying RSS changes due to weather events. These models are implemented in two new classifiers that localize border crossings with few missed detections and false alarms. We validate our proposed methods by implementing one of the classifiers in a three month long deployment of a solar-powered, real-time system that captures images of the border for ground truth validation. Furthermore, over 75 hours of RSS measurements are collected with an emphasis on collection during weather events, like rain and wind, during which we expect our classifiers to perform the worst. We demonstrate that the proposed classifiers outperform four other baseline classifiers in terms of false alarm probability by 1 to 4 orders of magnitude, and in terms of the misclassification probability by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.

Using crowdsourced visual and inertial sensor data for indoor mapping has attracted much attention in recent years. Nevertheless, the opportunities and challenges of indoor tracking using crowdsourced maps have not been fully explored. In this work, we aim at tackling the challenges due to incomplete obstacle information in crowdsourced indoor maps, especially at the initialization stage of crowdsourcing. We propose a novel solution for particle-filtering-based indoor tracking, using the crowdsourced maps derived from image-based 3D point clouds. Our solution enhances particle filtering with density-based collision detection and history-based particle regeneration. Evaluation with real user traces demonstrates that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art. In particular, it reduces the average distance error of indoor tracking by 47% when using crowdsourced 3D point clouds.

MAGIC: Model-Based Actuation for Ground Irrigation Control

Lawns make up the largest irrigated crop by surface area in North America, and carries with it a demand for over 9 billion gallons of freshwater each day. Despite recent developments in irrigation control and sprinkler technology, state-of-the-art irrigation systems do nothing to compensate for areas of turf with heterogeneous water needs. In this work, we overcome the physical limitations of the traditional irrigation system with the development of a sprinkler node that can sense the local soil moisture, communicate wirelessly, and actuate its own sprinkler based on a centrally- computed schedule. A model is then developed to compute moisture movement from runoff, absorption, and diffusion. Integrated with an optimization framework, optimal valve scheduling can be found for each node in the space. In a turf area covering over 10,000ft2, two separate deployments spanning a total of 7 weeks show that MAGIC can reduce water consumption by 23.4% over traditional campus scheduling, and by 12.3% over state-of-the- art evapotranspiration systems, while substantially improving conditions for plant health. In addition to environmental, social, and health benefits, MAGIC is shown to return its investment in 16-18 months based on water consumption alone.

Oppcast: Exploiting Spatial and Channel Diversity for Robust Data Collection in Urban Environments

2016
ZigBee shares the 2.4 GHz ISM band with a number of wireless technologies like WiFi, Bluetooth, and common household appliances like a microwave and a cordless phone to name a few. Due to the large-scale penetration of these technologies in urban environments, ZigBee communication suffers from severe cross-technology interference (CTI). Data collection in the presence of such highly dynamic CTI is quite challenging. Our work first examines the different deployment environments under the influence of planned and unplanned CTI and later proposes Oppcast, a robust and energy- efficient data collection protocol that carefully exploits a combination of spatial and channel diversity to eliminate the need for performing expensive channel estimation in advance. Our extensive evaluation in both a large-scale testbed (Academic Institution) and various urban environments (Carpark, Residential Complex, Shopping Mall and Cafeteria) shows that Oppcast is not only robust to CTI with reliability consistently maintained above 98.55%, but is also up to 2.4 times more energy efficient than the state-of-the-art data collection protocols. The rationale behind Oppcast exhibiting high robustness in highly dynamic environments is a significant increase in the number of communication opportunities it gets by exploiting multiple routes over multiple channels towards the destination.

At least since the terms Internet of Things, Factories of the Future or Industrial Internet gave distinction to the modern world of communication, there is a special need for efficient test- and debug tools targeting research and development of embedded wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSAN) in industrial automation technology and other non-consumer application areas in adverse environments. Those networks usually have tighter requirements on dependability, synchronization, and real-time capability as compared applications in environmental monitoring or home automation. For WSAN research and development, testbeds are a valuable tool as they enable controlled and repeatable operation under conditions close to reality. The contribution of this Ph.D. dissertation is to design, implement and set up a test environment for embedded industrial wireless sensor actuator networks, with special focus on energy constrained network nodes. This testbed should offer an previously unattained level of insight in timing characteristics of the network and the energy behavior of a single node. It allows to make statements about limitations of the deployed WSAN technology, or to compare different WSAN solutions in an automated manner. The uniqueness of this testbed setup is due to a scalable, affordable and maintainable organization both in software as well as the structure of the used hardware components.

While the use of the Global Positioning System provides a natural choice for sensor network localization, the high-accuracy requirements of certain applications prevent the use of low-cost GPS hardware as part of their localization solution. Low cost GPS hardware provides poor accuracy when used in isolation, but the sharing of measurement data between a network of common GPS receivers provides an opportunity to mitigate errors and provide a sub-meter localization solution. The goal of this work is to develop such a system by creating robust techniques that are resilient to outliers and other error sources encountered in the real-world.

We aim at developing software techniques which enables 32-bit transiently powered embedded systems to make progress across periods of energy unavailability without resorting to hardware modifications. Recently, we have seen a huge surge in wearable and smartbuilding centric sensing applications. However, these devices are integrated with batteries for charging which not only increases size and mass but also cost of the system. Powering the system directly from the energy harvesting source can mitigate this problem, but requires system software support to handle computations across power cycles, a paradigm known as transiently powered computing. We have designed portable system techniques to enable checkpointing of the program state on stable storage, along with its later recovery, with minimal latency and energy consumption. Right now, we are investigating how to determine where and when to perform checkpointing, and what support do we need to offer to developers to manage developing applications that may be interrupted for a non-negligible amount of time and later resume.

With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) seem to play key a role in the connectivity of smart objects. The limited resources of WSN devices and the increased demand for new and more sophisticated services call for new and more efficient architectures. The new architectures should ensure energy-efficiency, flexibility, reliability and robustness. We believe that using SDN principles in WSN will improve many important features, such as routing, robustness and reconfiguration of the networking as well as the applications. In this research, We will find ways to increase the robustness of WSN using an SDN inspired architecture and a statistical model. The initial plan is to use statistical machine learning to look for periodic interference and other periodic behaviour in typical WSN networks.

The dependability is one of the main pillars for the requirements in these application areas and can be defined in terms of reliability and maintainability. The definition of reliability is dependent on the application requirements. The motivation of this work is to model dependable WSNs so that e.g. the topology or configuration in general can be determined for given requirements regarding the metrics introduced.

The Amazon Rainforest degradation is a worldwide concern. The rainforest has been endangered by the illegal wood extraction without control even in the preservation areas. Due to the large geography extension prevent these crimes with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is not always possible. The Wireless Acoustics Sensor Network (WASNs) technology can alleviate this problem. Here, we present an acoustical framework to detect the sounds produced by several chainsaws. Our framework was developed to be embedded in a sensor node, combining the Mel-Fourier Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) with One-class classification technique. This classification method, that is based on a kernel density approach, allows us to recognize only chainsaw sounds rejecting all the other possible environmental sounds, such as: animal's calls, weather noises or boat engines. In the experiments, we varied the number MFCCs coefficients and the Kernel bandwidth performing a leave-one-out cross validation to find the best combination. Finally, we found that the best parameter combination achieve 98% of accuracy showing a low FNR and a high TPR, fact that enhances the credibility of the system avoiding false alarms and making it an optimal choice for an WSN application.

We present a heterogeneous system architecture for event-triggered wireless sensing capable of supporting high spatial resolution. The key differentiator between the proposed architecture and alternative state-of-the-art approaches is the ability to simultaneously maximize operational lifetime and minimize end-to-end latency of detected events. Our novel architecture takes advantage of heterogeneity with respect to the operation of the wireless communication protocol and the construction of the sensing platform.

Taking advantages of off-the-shelf cloud platform services, rather than maintaining a private database for logging the data from sensors, can significantly reduce labor and equipment costs for using a reliable database system. In this study, we present an inexpensive (less than 30 USD) embedded gateway with mobile network connectivity that can talk directly to cloud storage service providers, such as Google Apps Engine (hereafter called GAE). This embedded gateway can be used to collect data from networked wireless sensors in the field. The proposed design is characterized by: (1) using mobile networks to upload collected data without the need to pre-deploy conventional network equipment in the field; and (2) using cloud platform services for the logging of data. We designed and implemented this framework and installed it in a test site to evaluate its performance. This gateway framework can facilitate the design of a sensor system for collecting on-site signals, leveraging the benefits of cost-effective, always-ready, and reliable data storage service.

2016
The one of the major difficulties in deploying a wireless sensor to monitor debris flow in the real world is power consumption. Frequently replacing the battery of a sensor that is located in a remote mountainous area is not practical. In this study we examine the newly-introduced wireless debris flow sensor, SMARTCONE, which is designed to minimize the standby power consumption, but still keep alert to detecting debris flow. During standby periods, SMARTCONE turns off all major components and uses an accelerometer to sense vibration generated by moving debris flow, and it wakes up SMARTCONE for collecting the parameters of a moving debris flow. Multiple SMARTCONEs need to change operation modes between standby and wake up, collect physical parameters, and transmit data simultaneously, and these issues are kept in mind while designing the system. The performance of vibration detection, data transmission and records of GPS trajectories are evaluated to ensure the accuracy of the design.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are today widely employed in real world applications. However, their lifetime is still challenging and the most critical limitation for the success of this technology. In fact, wireless sensors nodes, which are the backbone of the network, are typically powered by limited energy storage devices (i.e. small batteries or supercaps) and their short lifetime is a critical issue. To overcome this limitation a major research effort focuses on reducing power consumption, especially of communication, as the radio transceiver is one of the highest power consumers. A critical energy-efficiency issue in WSN transceivers is idle listening. Wake-up radio receivers are very effective in minimizing idle listening. This fact has resulted in a significant number of wake-up radio receiver architectures proposed in last decade. In this work we present an advanced design and implementation of an advanced wake-up radio that is capable of both processing the received data (i.e. for addressing) and retransmitting data or wake up messages to the neighbours when necessary. With these features it can be possible to further enhance the energy efficiency of the communication and allowing ultra-low power multi-hop communication. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality as well as the power and range of the proposed design which is ready for future energy efficient and pure-asynchronous MAC protocols.

Probe vehicles consist in mobile traffic sensor networks that evolve with the flow of vehicles, transmitting velocity and position measurements along their path, generated using GPSs. To address the urban positioning issues of GPSs, we propose to replace them with inertial measurement units onboard vehicles, to estimate vehicle location and attitude using inertial data only. While promising, this technology requires one to carefully calibrate the orientation of the device inside the vehicle to be able to process the acceleration and rate gyro data. In this article, we propose a scheme that can perform this calibration automatically by leveraging the kinematic constraints of ground vehicles, and that can be implemented on low-end computational platforms. Preliminary testing shows that the proposed scheme enables one to accurately estimate the actual accelerations and rotation rates in the vehicle coordinates.

Visible Light Communication (VLC) is an emerging communication channel serving as a complement to traditional wireless communication. Visible light has many advantages over other communication channels like its inability to penetrate opaque objects. Securely sharing secret keys is a known problem in computer security. Sharing security keys using Radio Frequency (RF) communication is prone to sniffing attacks. In this paper, we introduce a system called BouKey which uses visible light to share keys. This makes BouKey immune to through the wall sniffing attacks. BouKey divides the key and shares it using multiple transmission bulbs allowing the key to be received in a specific area only. Our initial results show that the characteristics and height of the receiver, as well as the transmission angle play a key role in determining the shape and size of this area.

Poster Abstract: Efficient Visual Positioning with Adaptive Parameter Learning

Positioning with vision sensors is gaining its popularity, since it is more accurate, and requires much less bootstrapping and training effort. However, one of the major limitations of the existing solutions is the expensive visual processing pipeline: on resource-constrained mobile devices, it could take up to tens of seconds to process one frame. To address this, we propose a novel learning algorithm, which adaptively discovers the place dependent parameters for visual processing, such as which parts of the scene are more informative, and what kind of visual elements one would expect, as it is employed more and more by the users in a particular setting. With such meta- information, our positioning system dynamically adjust its behaviour, to localise the users with minimum effort. Preliminary results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the cost on visual processing significantly, and achieve sub-metre positioning accuracy.

Poster Abstract: Enhanced Real-Time Transmission Using Time Gain in Wireless Sensor Networks
2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2016
Real-time applications in wireless sensor networks require that packets should reach to a sink within the time deadline. To satisfy the requirements, existing studies exploit nodes whose speed is higher than the desired delivery speed decided by the spatiotemporal approach. However, they fail real-time transmission in the area where there is no neighbor nodes which meet the requirements toward a sink since the desired delivery speed is fixed. This paper proposes a scheme to pass the area using time gain which occurs by the nature of the existing real-time transmission scheme. Thus, in the area, a sending node could make full use of nodes which do not satisfy the requirements. In the end, the packet passes across the area with a lower speed than the desired delivery speed. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior in terms of real-time transmission success ratio to the existing schemes.

Poster Abstract: Exploiting Temporal Variation of Received Radio Signal Strength for Indoor Human Tracking

2016
Indoor positioning is one of the key technologies for enabling location-aware applications. To the best of our knowledge, existing indoor positioning technologies are aimed at providing very high-accuracy location information, but are hindered by the need of a infrastructure with high installation and maintenance costs. In addition, their accuracy is usually highly variable and vulnerable to environmental changes or external interference. Thus, for applications of indoor human tracking, the practical considerations of choosing a suitable indoor positioning technique should be to provide adequate accuracy while also being economical. Based on this observation, our study presents an indoor, room-level tracking method characterized by an infrastructure with low costs to build and maintain. The user carries a mobile device that can determine his/her location with the help of Bluetooth beacons installed at the intersections between rooms and hallways. In contrast to traditional radio-fingerprint map and proximity approaches, in this study the mobile device tracks the user's moving direction and the temporal variation of the radio signal strength from nearby Bluetooth beacons, to determine when the device enters or leaves a given room or hallway. Therefore, by determining the sequence of a user's movements, his/her moving path can be recorded for indoor tracking or navigation.

Wearable devices are massively entering in our life and they are more and more pushing the interest big electronic producer. Then, today many company are offering wearable "smart" objects to be worn which enable a wide range of application (form sport &amp; fitness, to entrainment, from tracking to health care). A common issue of wearable device that is reducing the appeal of them is the limited lifetime due to limited energy that can be stored in them batteries. Self-sustainable devices which can avoid to recharge or replace the batteries, as it happens in automatic quartz watches, is still a dream for wearable devices. This paper presents a wearable device with an ultra low camera, which can achieve this dream. To achieve this goal, the Wearable camera has been carefully designed with low power consumption in mind and leveraging a kinetic energy harvester to scavenge energy from the human body movements. The experimental results shows the impressive amount of energy (up to 9.6mJ per minute) that can be acquired during different human activities (running, walking, etc) and the self- sustainability of the solution acquiring up to more than 2000 images for hour when is running.

Most existing indoor localization systems are battery-powered and use the changes in Radio Frequency (RF) signals to localize objects. In this paper, we present LocaLight: a battery-free indoor localization system that localizes objects using visible light by tracking the shadow they cast. By sensing a drop in the intensity of ambient light caused by the presence of a shadow, LocaLight localizes the object. Since the position of the shadow can be predicted, it is possible to localize the object in a sensitive area by carefully positioning the light sensors and the overhead lights. Our initial results suggest that LocaLight achieves an accuracy comparable to many of the state-of-the art solutions that use RF.

It further integrates a state-of-the-art RF Wake-Up Receiver (WUR) that enables low-latency asynchronous communication, virtually eliminating idle listening at the main transceiver. Experimental results show that the MagoNode++ consumes only 2.8uA with the WUR in idle listening and the rest of the platform in sleep state, making it suitable for energy-constrained WSN scenarios and for energy-neutral applications.

Radio frequency based device-free passive localization has been actively studied. An important issue with this technique is that a large amount of sensor nodes are usually deployed in localization environments, causing high deployment cost, high computation complexity and other drawbacks. To reduce the number of nodes while maintaining high localization accuracy, this paper proposes a fingerprint-based node deployment mechanism, which saves hardware cost, speeds up node deployment process as well as maintains a similar accuracy. The experiments are conducted in two environments with considerably different sizes of 150 m2 and 25 m2. Maintaining the accuracies above 95%, the proposed mechanism can efficiently reduce the total number of nodes in large room by 54.55% and in small room by 68.75%. Especially, the localization response time sharply reduces by 93.08% in the large room and 79.87% in the small room.

With smart buildings becoming popular, it is important to track the wastage of energy in public shared buildings to save energy. Current monitoring systems do not provide real-time visibility into the impact of occupants' actions on energy consumption of a building. We propose a system that tracks the energy consumed by users in shared spaces such as offices thereby making them aware and accountable for the energy they consume. Our system combines energy monitoring with localization techniques to generate real-time energy footprints for every occupant in a shared space and provides actionable feedback to them in the form of visualization.

Significant energy wasted in private homes each year. Most of the times, the residents do not know the cause of energy waste in their homes. We designed several activities to encourage the homeowners to learn about how energy is used at their homes and start thinking about eliminating those waste. The program consists of twelve weekly activities in which the homeowners participate. We analyzed monthly electricity bills for all the program's participants and found that energy savings achieved by the participants has close relationship to level of their engagement in the program. People who were highly involved in program saved much more energy (5%) compared to participants who were involved in less than 25% of activities.

Long lifetime is the most pursued goal in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). As communication is typically the most energy consuming task, a lot of effort has been devoted to design energy efficient communication protocols using duty-cycling in the last decades. However, in the recent years, a new kind of Ultra Low Power (ULP) receivers, called Wake-up Receivers (WuRx), is emerging. These devices allow the continuous monitoring of the wireless channel while having a power consumption orders of magnitude less than typical WSNs transceivers. WuRx can wake-up the rest of the system (microcontroller (MCU) and main radio) using interrupts only when needed, minimizing the idle listening. In this work, we present an experimental and an analytical study which ultimately serve as guidelines for the design of communication protocols leveraging WuRx.

2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2016
The paper develops a recursive state estimator for social network data streams that allows exploitation of social networks, such as Twitter, as sensor networks to reliably observe physical events. Recent literature suggested using social networks as sensor networks leveraging the fact that much of the information upload on the former constitutes acts of sensing. A significant challenge identified in that context was that source reliability is often unknown, leading to uncertainty regarding the veracity of reported observations. Multiple truth finding systems were developed to solve this problem, generally geared towards batch analysis of offline datasets. This work complements the present batch approaches by developing an online recursive state estimator that recovers ground truth from streaming data. In this paper, we model physical world state by a set of binary signals (propositions, called assertions, about world state) and the social network as a noisy medium, where distortion, fabrication, omissions, and duplication are introduced. Our recursive state estimator is designed to recover the original binary signal (the true propositions) from the received noisy signal, essentially decoding the unreliable social network output to obtain the best estimate of ground truth in the physical world. Results show that the estimator is both effective and efficient at recovering the original signal with a high degree of accuracy. The estimator gives rise to a novel situation awareness tool that can be used for reliably following unfolding events in real time, using dynamically arriving social network data.

RNFD: Routing-Layer Detection of DODAG (Root) Node Failures in Low-Power Wireless Networks
2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2016
While routing protocols for low-power wireless networks, such as CTP or RPL, handle link failures relatively well, node failures have received considerably less research attention. This paper thus studies crash-failures of destination nodes in distance-vector routing, that is, failures of so-called DODAG root nodes. First, it demonstrates empirically that handling root node crashes in existing state-of-the-art routing protocols leaves room for improvement or even fails completely in some cases. Second, based on an analysis of this behavior, the paper proposes RNFD, a new algorithm that explicitly tracks node failures at the routing layer. The algorithm is designed as a framework that complements rather than replaces regular route maintenance algorithms, which facilitates its integration with the existing protocols. Third, the paper evaluates a prototype implementation of RNFD through simulations and testbed experiments. In particular, it demonstrates that, with little information overhead, RNFD can speed up node failure detection by an order of magnitude and considerably reduce the traffic during the process.

Sensor-Assisted Face Recognition System on Smart Glass via Multi-View Sparse Representation Classification

2016
Face recognition is one of the most popular research problems on various platforms. New research issues arise when it comes to resource constrained devices, such as smart glasses, due to the overwhelming computation and energy requirements of the accurate face recognition methods. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient sensor-assisted face recognition system on smart glasses by exploring the power of multimodal sensors including the camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The system is based on a novel face recognition algorithm, namely Multi-view Sparse Representation Classification (MVSRC), by exploiting the prolific information among multi-view face images. To improve the efficiency of MVSRC on smart glasses, we propose a novel sampling optimization strategy using the less expensive inertial sensors. Our evaluations on public and private datasets show that the proposed method is up to 10% more accurate than the state-of-the-art multi-view face recognition methods while its computation cost is in the same order as an efficient benchmark method (e.g., Eigenfaces). Finally, extensive real-world experiments show that our proposed system improves recognition accuracy by up to 15% while achieving the same level of system overhead compared to the existing face recognition system (OpenCV algorithms) on smart glasses.

Modern IoT prototyping platforms fall short in terms of energy efficiency, connectivity and software programming practices. We present the design of a new hardware and software platform that addresses these shortcomings by bringing together Mobile, Wearable, Maker and Wireless Sensor Network technologies to enable rapid prototyping with a high degree of synergy and energy efficiency. This is achieved in part by leveraging the Memory Protection Unit on modern microcontrollers along with a novel syscall interface to provide kernel / user isolation and a clean concurrency model. Such a design allows a wide range of languages to be used for application development without significant adaptation. We demonstrate how careful choice of application language allows the naturally asynchronous nature of embedded programming to be expressed cleanly and powerfully. Finally we evaluate the platform in several integrated use cases, providing examples of the capabilities introduced by Synergy.

TinySDM: Software Defined Measurement in Wireless Sensor Networks
2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2016
Network measurement, which provides detailed information about the behaviors of operational networks, is essential for network management in wireless sensor networks. In the literature, there have been many approaches focusing on measuring individual aspect of the network, e.g., per-packet routing path and per-hop delay. However, there lacks a general support for conducting different measurement tasks. When managing an operational network, a network operator often needs to switch the current measurement task to a different one, in order to diagnose the observed symptoms. In this paper, we propose TinySDM, a software-defined measurement architecture for WSNs. TinySDM provides a general support for conducting different measurement tasks. TinySDM defines a set of carefully selected hooks that allow the users to easily execute their own measurement tasks. In addition, TinySDM provides a C- like language called TinyCode Language (TCL) to enable easy customization of measurement tasks. By only transmitting the binary code of the measurement task, TinySDM significantly reduces the size of the disseminated data compared with existing reprogramming approaches. We implement TinySDM on the TinyOS/TelosB platform and evaluate its performance extensively in a testbed with 60 nodes. We also use TCL to implement four specific measurement tasks. Results show that TinySDM is flexible, efficient and easily programmable.

Topic-Aware Social Sensing with Arbitrary Source Dependency Graphs
2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2016
This work is motivated by the emergence of social sensing as a new paradigm of collecting observations about the physical environment from humans or devices on their behalf. These observations may be true or false, and hence are viewed as binary claims. A fundamental problem in social sensing applications lies in ascertaining the correctness of claims and the reliability of data sources without knowing either of them a priori. We refer to this problem as truth discovery. Prior works have made significant progress to addressing the truth discovery problem, but two significant limitations exist: (i) they ignored the fact that claims reported in social sensing applications can be either relevant or irrelevant to the topic of interests. (ii) They either assumed the data sources to be independent or the source dependency graphs can be represented as a set of disjoint trees. These limitations led to suboptimal truth discovery results. In contrast, this paper presents the first social sensing framework that explicitly incorporates the topic relevance feature of claims and arbitrary source dependency graphs into the solutions of truth discovery problem. The new framework solves a multidimensional maximum likelihood estimation problem to jointly estimate the truthfulness and topic relevance of claims as well as the reliability and topic awareness of sources. We compared our new scheme with the state-of-the-art truth discovery solutions using three real world data traces collected from Twitter in the aftermath of Paris Shooting event (2015), Hurricane Arthur (2014) and Boston Bombing event (2013) respectively. The evaluation results showed that our schemes significantly outperform the compared baselines by identifying more relevant and truthful claims in the truth discovery results.

VibID: User Identification through Bio-Vibrometry
2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2016
User identification is an essential problem for security protection and data privacy preservation of wearable devices. With proper user identification, wearable devices can adopt personalized settings for different users, automatically label the corresponding data to protect user privacy, and help prevent illegal user spoofing attacks. Current user identification solutions proposed for wearable devices either rely on dedicated devices with high cost or require user intervention which is not convenient. In this work, we leverage the bio-vibrometry to enable a novel user identification solution for wearable devices in small-scale scenarios, e.g., household scenario. Unlike existing user identification solutions, our system only uses the low-cost sensors that are already available for most wearable devices. The key idea is that, when human body is exposed to a vibration excitation, the vibration response reflects the physical characteristics of user, i.e., the mass, stiffness and damping. Meanwhile, due to users' biological diversity, such physical characteristics of different users are quite distinctive. Therefore, we can leverage the discrepancy in users' vibration responses as an identifier. Based on this idea, we propose VibID, which only uses a low-cost vibration motor and accelerometer to generate an unobtrusive vibration to users' arms and capture the corresponding responses. By examining the vibration patterns at different frequencies, VibID builds an ensemble machine learning model to recognize who is using the device. Extensive experiments are conducted on human subjects to demonstrate that our system is reliable in small- scale scenarios and robust to various confounding factors, e.g., arm position, muscle state, user mobility and wearing location. We also show that, in an uncontrolled scenario of 8 users, our system can still ensure a identification accuracy above 91%.

Walkie-Talkie: Motion-Assisted Automatic Key Generation for Secure On-Body Device Communication
2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2016
Ubiquity of wearable and implantable devices sparks a new set of mobile computing applications that leverage the prolific information of sensors. For many of these applications, to ensure the security of communication between legitimate devices is a crucial problem. In this paper, we design Walkie-Talkie, a shared secret key generation scheme that allows two legitimate devices to establish a common cryptographic key by exploiting users' walking characteristics (gait). The intuition is that the sensors on different locations of the same body experience similar accelerometer signal when the user is walking. However, the accelerometer also captures motion signal produced by other body parts (e.g., swinging arms). We address this issue by employing Blind Source Separation (BSS) technique to extract the informative signal produced by the unique gait pattern. Our experimental results show that the keys generated by two independent devices on the same body are able to achieve up to 100% bit agreement rate. To demonstrate the feasibility, we implement the proposed key generation scheme on modern smartphones. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme can run in real-time on modern mobile devices and incurs low system overhead.

WiWho: WiFi-Based Person Identification in Smart Spaces
2016 15th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2016
There has been a growing interest in equipping the objects and environment surrounding the user with sensing capabilities. Smart indoor spaces such as smart homes and offices can implement the sensing and processing functionality, relieving users from the need of wearing or carrying smart devices. Enabling such smart spaces requires device-free effortless sensing of user's identity and activities. Device-free sensing using WiFi has shown great potential in such scenarios, however, fundamental questions such as person identification have remained unsolved. In this paper, we present WiWho, a framework that can identify a person from a small group of people in a device-free manner using WiFi. We show that Channel State Information (CSI) used in recent WiFi can identify a person's steps and walking gait. The walking gait being distinguishing characteristics for different people, WiWho uses CSI-based gait for person identification. We demonstrate how step and walk analysis can be used to identify a person's walking gait from CSI, and how this information can be used to identify a person. WiWho does not require a person to carry any device and is effortless since it only requires the person to walk for a few steps (e.g. entering a home or an office). We evaluate WiWho using experiments at multiple locations with a total of 20 volunteers, and show that it can identify a person with average accuracy of 92% to 80% from a group of 2 to 6 people. We also show that in most cases walking as few as 2-3 meters is sufficient to recognize a person's gait and identify the person. We discuss the potential and challenges of WiFi- based person identification with respect to smart space applications.

Coresets for Differentially Private K-Means Clustering and Applications to Privacy in Mobile Sensor Networks
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2017
Mobile sensor networks are a great source of data. By collecting data with mobile sensor nodes from individuals in a user community, e.g. using their smartphones, we can learn global information such as tramc congestion patterns in the city, location of key community facilities, and locations of gathering places. Can we publish and run queries on mobile sensor network databases without disclosing information about individual nodes? Differential privacy is a strong notion of privacy which guarantees that very little will be learned about individual records in the database, no matter what the attackers already know or wish to learn. Still, there is no practical system applying differential privacy algorithms for clustering points on real databases. This paper describes the construction of small coresets for computing k-means clustering of a set of points while preserving differential privacy. As a result, we give the first k-means clustering algorithm that is both differentially private, and has an approximation error that depends sub-linearly on the data's dimension d. Previous results introduced errors that are exponential in d. We implemented this algorithm and used it to create differentially private location data from GPS tracks. Specifically our algorithm allows clustering GPS databases generated from mobile nodes, while letting the user control the introduced noise due to privacy. We provide experimental results for the system and algorithms, and compare them to existing techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical system that enables differentially private clustering on real data.

MinHash Hierarchy for Privacy Preserving Trajectory Sensing and Query

In this work, we study privacy preserving trajectory sensing and query when n mobile entities (e.g., mobile devices or vehicles) move in an environment of m checkpoints (e.g, WiFi or cellular towers). The checkpoints detect the appearances of mobile entities in the proximity, meanwhile, employ the MinHash signatures to record the set of mobile entities passing by. We build on the checkpoints a distributed data structure named the MinHash hierarchy, with which one can efficiently answer queries regarding popular paths and other traffic patterns. The MinHash hierarchy has a total of near linear storage, linear construction cost, and logarithmic update cost. The cost of a popular path query is logarithmic in the number of checkpoints. Further, the MinHash signature provides privacy protection using a model inspired by the differential privacy model. We evaluated our algorithm using a large mobility data set and compared with previous works to demonstrate its utilities and performances.

Density-Aware Compressive CrowdSensing

2017
Crowdsensing systems collect large-scale sensor data from mobile devices to provide a wide-area view of phenomena including traffic, noise and air pollution. Because such data often exhibits sparse structure, it is natural to apply compressive sensing (CS) for data sampling and recovery. However in practice, crowd participants are often distributed highly unevenly across the sensing area, and thus the numbers of observations collected over different areas may vary wildly - an issue we call density disparity. Density disparity leads to inaccuracy in low density areas, and potentially undermines the recovery performance if conventional compressive sensing is applied directly, which equally treats data from areas of different density. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic accuracy estimator, based on which we devise two recovery algorithms: Threshold Recovery (TR) and Weighted Recovery (WR). As general-purpose recovery algorithms, TR and WR improve the performance of CS in the scenarios with density disparity, and also provide better guarantees in terms of &#x20AC;2-norm accuracy compared with conventional CS recovery algorithms. We also conduct extensive experiments based on synthetic and real-life datasets. Our results show that TR/WR typically reduce &#x20AC;2-norm error by more than 60% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

SCAN: Learning Speaker Identity from Noisy Sensor Data

Sensor data acquired from multiple sensors simultaneously is featuring increasingly in our ever more pervasive world. Buildings can be made smarter and more efficient, spaces more responsive to users. A fundamental building block towards smart spaces is the ability to understand who is present in a certain area. A ubiquitous way of detecting this is to exploit the unique vocal features as people interact with one another. As an example, consider audio features sampled during a meeting, yielding a noisy set of possible voiceprints. With a number of meetings and knowledge of participation (e.g. through a calendar or MAC address), can we learn to associate a specific identity with a particular voiceprint? Obviously enrolling users into a biometric database is time-consuming and not robust to vocal deviations over time. To address this problem, the standard approach is to perform a clustering step (e.g. of audio data) followed by a data association step, when identity-rich sensor data is available. In this paper we show that this approach is not robust to noise in either type of sensor stream; to tackle this issue we propose a novel algorithm that jointly optimises the clustering and association process yielding up to three times higher identification precision than approaches that execute these steps sequentially. We demonstrate the performance benefits of our approach in two case studies, one with acoustic and MAC datasets that we collected from meetings in a non-residential building, and another from an online dataset from recorded radio interviews.

Synchronous Dynamic View Learning: A Framework for Autonomous Training of Activity Recognition Models Using Wearable Sensors

2017
Wearable technologies play a central role in human-centered Internetof-Things applications. Wearables leverage machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. These algorithms, however, need to be retrained upon any changes in configuration of the system, such as addition/ removal of a sensor to/ from the network or displacement/ misplacement/ mis-orientation of the physical sensors on the body. We challenge this retraining model by stimulating the vision of autonomous learning with the goal of eliminating the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and highly expensive process of collecting labeled training data in dynamic environments. We propose an approach for autonomous retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any new labeled training data. We focus on a dynamic setting where new sensors are added to the system and worn on various body locations. We capture the inherent correlation between observations made by a static sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new dynamic sensor views for which an algorithm needs to be developed. By applying our realtime dynamic-view autonomous learning approach, we achieve an average accuracy of 81.1% in activity recognition using three experimental datasets. This amount of accuracy represents more than 13.8% improvement in the accuracy due to the automatic labeling of the sensor data in the newly added sensor. This performance is only 11.2% lower than the experimental upper bound where labeled training data are collected with the new sensor.

Griassdi: Mutually Assisted Slotless Neighbor Discovery
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2017
Recent results show that slotless, purely-interval based neighbor discovery protocols, in which time is assumed to be continuous, achieve significantly lower worst-case discovery latencies than time-slotted protocols. In slotted protocols, the discovery of device A by B and vice-versa occurs within the same slot, and hence the latencies for one-way and two-way discovery are identical. However, in purely interval-based protocols, these latencies are independent from each other, leading to longer mean latencies for two-way discovery. In this paper, we propose a cooperative approach to reduce this two-way discovery latency. In particular, each side broadcasts information on the time-period until its next reception phase takes place. The remote device adjusts its beacon schedule accordingly once a first packet is received. Compared to non-cooperative slotless protocols, this technique can reduce the two-way discovery latency by up to 43 %. We propose a theory to model such protocols and show that with an optimized schedule, our proposed protocol achieves considerably shorter mean latencies than all known protocols, while still guaranteeing worst-case latencies that are similar to the best known solutions. For example, compared to Searchlight-Striped, our proposed protocol achieves by up to 89 % lower mean latencies and by up to 86 % lower worst-case latencies.

BLEnd: Practical Continuous Neighbor Discovery for Bluetooth Low Energy

2017
Identifying &#x201C;who is around&#x201D; is key in a plethora of smart scenarios. While many solutions exist, they often take a theoretical approach, reasoning about protocol behavior with an abstract model that makes simplifying assumptions about the environment. This approach creates a gap between protocol implementations and the models used during design and analysis. In this paper, we take a system approach to continuous neighbor discovery: starting with the concrete technology of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) we build a protocol, called BLEnd, tailored to its constraints. Moreover, we also consider the very real effects of packet collisions, to our knowledge a first in this domain. Our ultimate goal is to directly empower developers with the ability to determine the optimal protocol configuration for their applications; in this respect, the slotless operation of BLEnd offers richer alternatives than state-of-the-art protocols. Developers specify the minimum discovery probability, the target discovery latency, and the maximum expected node density; these are used by an optimizer tool to parameterize the BLEnd implementation towards maximum lifetime. This paper shows that BLEnd not only achieves the user-specified goals, but does so more efficiently than analogous configurations of competing protocols.

Panoptes: Servicing Multiple Applications Simultaneously Using Steerable Cameras
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2017
Steerable surveillance cameras offer a unique opportunity to support multiple vision applications simultaneously. However, stateof-art camera systems do not support this as they are often limited to one application per camera. We believe that we should break the one-to-one binding between the steerable camera and the application. By doing this we can quickly move the camera to a new view needed to support a different vision application. When done well, the scheduling algorithm can support a larger number of applications over an existing network of surveillance cameras. With this in mind we developed Panoptes, a technique that virtualizes a camera view and presents a different fixed view to different applications. A scheduler uses camera controls to move the camera appropriately providing the expected view for each application in a timely manner, minimizing the impact on application performance. Experiments with a live camera setup demonstrate that Panoptes can support multiple applications, capturing up to 80% more events of interest in a wide scene, compared to a fixed view camera.

In this paper, we are interested in the 3D through-wall imaging of a completely unknown area, using WiFi RSSI and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that move outside of the area of interest to collect WiFi measurements. It is challenging to estimate a volume represented by an extremely high number of voxels with a small number of measurements. Yet many applications are time-critical and/or limited on resources, precluding extensive measurement collection. In this paper, we then propose an approach based on Markov random field modeling, loopy belief propagation, and sparse signal processing for 3D imaging based on wireless power measurements. Furthermore, we show how to design emcient aerial routes that are informative for 3D imaging. Finally, we design and implement a complete experimental testbed and show high-quality 3D robotic through-wall imaging of unknown areas with less than 4% of measurements.

VideoMec: A Metadata-Enhanced Crowdsourcing System for Mobile Videos
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks

2017
The exponential growth of mobile videos has enabled a variety of video crowdsourcing applications. However, existing crowdsourcing approaches require all video files to be uploaded, wasting a large amount of bandwidth since not all crowdsourced videos are useful. Moreover, it is difficult for applications to find desired videos based on user-generated annotations, which can be inaccurate or miss important information. To address these issues, we present VideoMec, a video crowdsourcing system that automatically generates video descriptions based on various geographical and geometrical information, called metadata, from multiple embedded sensors in off-the-shelf mobile devices. With VideoMec, only a small amount of metadata needs to be uploaded to the server, hence reducing the bandwidth and energy consumption of mobile devices. Based on the uploaded metadata, VideoMec supports comprehensive queries for applications to find and fetch desired videos. For time-sensitive applications, it may not be possible to upload all desired videos in time due to limited wireless bandwidth and large video files.

Argus: Realistic Target Coverage by Drones
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2017
Low-cost mini-drones with advanced sensing and maneuverability enable a new class of intelligent visual sensing systems. This potential motivated several research efforts to employ drones as standalone surveillance systems or to assist legacy deployments. However, several fundamental challenges remain unsolved including: 1) Adequate coverage of sizable targets; 2) Target orientation that render coverage effective only from certain directions; 3) Occlusion by elements in the environment, including other targets. In this paper, we present Argus, a system that provides visual coverage of wide and oriented targets, using camera-mounted drones, taking into account the challenges stated above. Argus relies on a geometric model that captures both target shapes and coverage constraints. With drones being the scarcest resource in Argus, we study the problem of minimizing the number of drones required to cover a set of such targets and derive a best-possible approximation algorithm. Building upon that, we present a sampling heuristic that performs favorably, while running up to 100x faster compared to the approximation algorithm. We implement a complete prototype of Argus to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed coverage algorithms within a fully autonomous surveillance system. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithms via simulations to compare their performance at scale under various conditions.

2017
Internet of Things (IoT) is flourishing and has penetrated deeply into people's daily life. With the seamless connection to the physical world, IoT provides tremendous opportunities to a wide range of applications. However, potential risks exist when the IoT system collects sensor data and uploads it to the cloud. The leakage of private data can be severe with curious database administrator or malicious hackers who compromise the cloud. In this work, we propose Kryptein, a compressive-sensing-based encryption scheme for cloud-enabled IoT systems to secure the interaction between the IoT devices and the cloud. Kryptein supports random compressed encryption, statistical decryption, and accurate raw data decryption. According to our evaluation based on two real datasets, Kryptein provides strong protection to the data. It is 250 times faster than other state-of-the-art systems and incurs 120 times less energy consumption. The performance of Kryptein is also measured on off-the-shelf IoT devices, and the result shows Kryptein can run efficiently on IoT devices.

PitchIn: Eavesdropping via Intelligible Speech Reconstruction Using Non-acoustic Sensor Fusion
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2017
Despite the advent of numerous Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, recent research demonstrates potential side-channel vulnerabilities exploiting sensors which are used for event and environment monitoring. In this paper, we propose a new side-channel attack, where a network of distributed non-acoustic sensors can be exploited by an attacker to launch an eavesdropping attack by reconstructing intelligible speech signals. Specifically, we present PitchIn to demonstrate the feasibility of speech reconstruction from non-acoustic sensor data collected offline across networked devices. Unlike speech reconstruction which requires a high sampling frequency (e.g., &gt; 5 KHz), typical applications using non-acoustic sensors do not rely on richly sampled data, presenting a challenge to the speech reconstruction attack. Hence, PitchIn leverages a distributed form of Time Interleaved Analog-Digital-Conversion (TIADC) to approximate a high sampling frequency, while maintaining low per-node sampling frequency. We demonstrate how distributed TI-ADC can be used to achieve intelligibility by processing an interleaved signal composed of different sensors across networked devices. We implement PitchIn and evaluate reconstructed speech signal intelligibility via user studies. PitchIn has word recognition accuracy as high as 79%. Though some additional work is required to improve accuracy, our results suggest that eavesdropping using a fusion of non-acoustic sensors is a real and practical threat.

SurfaceVibe: Vibration-Based Tap &amp; Swipe Tracking on Ubiquitous Surfaces
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2017
Touch surfaces are intuitive interfaces for computing devices. Most of the traditional touch interfaces (vision, IR, capacitive, etc.) have mounting requirements, resulting in specialized touch surfaces limited by their size, cost, and mobility. More recent work has shown that vibration-based touch sensing techniques can localize taps/knocks, which provides a low-cost flexible alternative. These surfaces are envisioned as intuitive inputs for applications such as interactive meeting tables, smart kitchen appliance control, etc. However, due to dispersive and reflective properties of various vibrating mediums, it is difficult to localize taps accurately on ubiquitous surfaces. Furthermore, no work has been done on tracking continuous swipe interactions through vibration sensing. In this paper, we present SurfaceVibe, a vibration-based interaction tracking system for multiple surface types. The system accounts for physics properties of different waves to allow two major interaction types: tap and swipe. For tap induced impulse-like surface waves, we design an algorithm that takes wave dispersion and reflection into account to achieve accurate localization on ubiquitous surfaces. For swipe induced body waves, SurfaceVibe segments signals into `slip pulses' to localize, and then tracks the trajectory. We validate SurfaceVibe through experiments on different materials and varying surface/sensing area sizes in this paper. Our methods achieve up to 6&#x00D7; decrease in localization error for taps and 3&#x00D7; reduction in length estimation error for swipes compared to existing algorithms that do not take wave properties into account.

HarvOS: Efficient Code Instrumentation for Transiently-Powered Embedded Sensing

2017
We present code instrumentation strategies to allow transientlypowered embedded sensing devices efficiently checkpoint the system's state before energy is exhausted. Our solution, called HARvOS, operates at compile-time with limited developer intervention based on the control-flow graph of a program, while adapting to varying levels of remaining energy and possible program executions at run-time. In addition, the underlying design rationale allows the system to spare the energy-intensive probing of the energy buffer whenever possible. Compared to existing approaches, our evaluation indicates that HARvOS allows transiently-powered devices to complete a given workload with 68% fewer checkpoints, on average. Moreover, our performance in the number of required checkpoints rests only 19% far from that of an &#x201C;oracle&#x201D; that represents an ideal solution, yet unfeasible in practice, that knows exactly the last point in time when to checkpoint.

Fast and Robust GPS Fix Using One Millisecond of Data

None
2017
GPS is used for outdoor localization in a large variety of applications. Current receivers consume too much power for energy-constrained situations like continuous location tracking on small wearable devices. Mainly, this is due to the large amount of GPS signal that has to be decoded to compute the first position fix. While Coarse-Time Navigation (CTN) can reduce the necessary signal to a few milliseconds, it is not robust to noise. Collective Detection (CD) of satellites can mitigate noise to some degree, but the basic method is computationally expensive. We show how CD can be solved optimally and emciently. Furthermore, we improve the accuracy of CD by exploiting the shape of the likelihood function. All our results are based on real-world signal observations and we achieve localization accuracies of less than 25 meters using a single millisecond of signal. When using 10 consecutive millisecond samples the accuracy improves to less than 10 meters.

Calibration-Free Network Localization Using Non-line-of-sight Ultra-wideband Measurements
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2017
We present a method for calibration-free, infrastructure-free localization in sensor networks. Our strategy is to estimate node positions and noise distributions of all links in the network simultaneously - a strategy that has not been attempted thus far. In particular, we account for biased, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) range measurements from ultra-wideband (UWB) devices that lead to multi-modal noise distributions, for which few solutions exist to date. Our approach circumvents cumbersome a-priori calibration, allows for rapid deployment in unknown environments, and facilitates adaptation to changing conditions. Our first contribution is a generalization of the classical multidimensional scaling algorithm to account for measurements that have multi-modal error distributions. Our second contribution is an online approach that iterates between node localization and noise parameter estimation. We validate our method in 3-dimensional networks, (i) through simulation to test the sensitivity of the algorithm on its design parameters, and (ii) through physical experimentation in a NLOS environment. Our setup uses UWB devices that provide time-offlight measurements, which can lead to positively biased distance measurements in NLOS conditions. We show that our algorithm converges to accurate position estimates, even when initial position estimates are very uncertain, initial error models are unknown, and a significant proportion of the network links are in NLOS.

PhD Forum Abstract: Non-intrusive Blood Glucose Monitor by Multi-task Deep Learning

2017
Blood glucose concentration plays an important role in personal health. Hyperglycemia results in diabetes, leading to health risks such as pancreatic function failure, immunity reduce and ocular fundus diseases [6]. Meanwhile, hypoglycemia also brings complications such as confusion, shakiness, anxiety, and if not treated in time, coma or death [2]. People with diabetes need tight control of their blood glucose concentration to avoid both short-term and longterm physiological complications. In this work, we design BGMonitor, the first personalized smartphone-based non-invasive blood glucose monitoring system that detects abnormal blood glucose events by jointly tracking meal, drugs and insulin intake, physical activity and sleep quality. When BGMonitor detects an abnormal blood glucose event, it reminds the user to double-check by finger pricking or using clinical CGM devices.

PhD Forum Abstract: Separating Heartbeats from Multiple People on One Bed Using Geophones
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2017
Sensing bed vibrations caused by heartbeats has shown great potentials in detecting and monitoring a person's heartbeats during sleep, without requiring special mattress or sheets, or assuming certain sleeping position/posture. Earlier work has studied how to use this method to detect heartbeats when a single subject is on the bed, and in this study, we aim to separate the heartbeats when multiple subjects share the same bed and the vibration signals are mixed together. Our heartbeat separation algorithm is based upon signal unmixing via time-frequency masking [4], which was originally designed to extract individual voices from two audio mixtures. Though these two problems have similarity, separating heartbeat signals is much harder and poses new challenges, mainly because heartbeat signals have a much smaller frequency range than audio signals, fluctuate considerably from beat to beat, and propagate through a mattress that has much more complex propagation properties than the air. In this study, we address these challenges by carefully designing the signal processing algorithms, especially in phase correction, filtering, window size choice, etc. Through detailed experimentation, we show that our technique can accurately separate two heartbeats (the most common case) using two vibration sensors (geophones in our case) - with an average estimation error below 2 beats per minute.

Demo Abstract: A LoRa Wireless Mesh Networking Module for Campus-Scale Monitoring

2017
LoRa, an emerging wireless technology, is examined for long range communication performance in a large area. Although LoRa shows good performance for long-distance transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated and interfered with by buildings, trees and other signal sources. In urban areas, our observation shows that LoRa requires a dense deployment of LoRa gateways to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can transfer data back to remote servers. Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus). We deployed 19 LoRa mesh-networking devices distributed in an 800m by 600m area on campus to serve as a gateway and to collect data at one-minute intervals. The results show our LoRa mesh networking module achieved a 88.49% packet delivery ratio (PDR), while the LoRaWAN in star-network topology was only 58.7% under the same conditions.

This paper presents a smart badge system for managing museum visitors and improving their viewing experience. The badge uses a LoRa wireless interface for two-way long-distance communication with tour guides and the museum's control center. The control center can collect information such as the visitors' viewing preferences, location, and status of activity level, enabling it to wirelessly send suggestions of exhibits and visiting paths to visitors, avoiding the overcrowding of visitors in one location. Meanwhile, visitors can communicate with the control center to update their locations and ask simple questions via the badge. In this paper, we introduce the system architecture and the prototype smart badge that we used to evaluate the performance of this system.

Demo Abstract: Understanding Slotless Neighbor Discovery
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2017
The process of two wireless devices meeting over-the-air for the first time is referred to as neighbor discovery. In mobile ad-hoc networks, battery powered devices duty-cycle their radios during neighbor discovery. As a result, they transmit and receive for very short durations of time and sleep at other times. Energy-emcient protocols, which guarantee short, bounded latencies while achieving low energy-consumptions are highly important for long battery lifetimes. In the past, neighbor discovery has been carried out mostly using slotted protocols, which subdivide time into multiple, equal length periods, called slots. An alternative are slotless protocols, which decouple beaconing from listening and can potentially achieve lower latency-duty-cycle-relations. As in slotted protocols, they also guarantee bounded latencies. However, understanding the mechanisms that ensure these deterministic bounds is more complex than for slotted protocols, since they rely on less intuitive concepts. In this demo, we propose a setup that visualizes the operation of two radios with slotless protocols in real-time, thereby providing insights that help in understanding slotless neighbor discovery. This demo is supposed to accompany the paper entitled &#x201D;Griassdi: Mutually Assisted Slotless Neighbor Discovery Protocols&#x201D;, which appeared at IPSN 2017 as a regular paper.

Textual health advice generated from different online sources (e.g., health apps and websites) can be conflicting. Conflicts can occur due to lexical features, (such as, negation, antonyms, or numerical mismatch) or can be conditioned upon time and/or physiological status. Detecting conflicts from textual health advice poses several challenges, including, large structural variation between text and hypothesis pairs, finding conceptual overlap between pairs of advice, and inference of the semantics of an advice (i.e., what to do, why, and how). In this demonstration, we present a semantic rule-based system to detect different types of conflicts in online textual health advice statements in a context-aware and interpretable manner.

The continuous fluctuation of electric network frequency (ENF) presents a fingerprint indicative of time, which we call natural timestamp.

The voltage sensors and the EMR sensors capture the minute fluctuations of the length of each voltage cycle and the average ENF over every 50 voltage cycles, respectively. The evaluation in our prior studies [1, 3] has shown that the natural timestamps recorded by the voltage sensors and the EMR sensors give sub-millisecond and sub-second average time errors, respectively. This demo will also show their time errors.

This makes the system compact, affordable yet very sensitive so that it can be reliably used for tidal breathing analysis, a new trend that emerged recently as opposed to traditional Spirometric test (based on forced breathing) that is both tedious and painful for patients with pulmonary obstructions. This work may turn out quite useful in needy geographies as pulmonary ailments like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is rapidly becoming an epidemic and requires immediate attention.

Monitoring heartbeats takes an important role to ensure a person's health and well-being. Few of the existing systems are accurate, unobtrusive, robust and easy to install at the same time. Thus, we propose a completely unobtrusive system which can detect heartbeats during sleep by sensing the weak ballistic vibrations caused by heartbeats on any bed. The system, HB-Phone, is centered around the off-the-shelf geophone sensor and can be easily installed on an existing bed. In this demo, we demonstrate that our system can detect and extract heartbeats accurately and in real time, even with the presence of noise from the environment and gross body movements during sleep.

Using an air purifying system can remove indoor air pollutants, but because it increases electric power utilization, results in broader increases in air pollution. To explore the tradeoff between energy consumption and healthful air, we demonstrate the indoor air sensing and automation (IASA) system, an internet-of-things system. The IASA system uses an air quality sensor, gateway device, and smart thermostat to control the fan in a home's heating and cooling system. When fine particulate matter is high, the system operates the fan to pull air through a furnace filter and remove the pollution from the indoor air. We describe our system design, deployment, and collected data. To date, we have collected 861,000 air quality measurements with IASA.

Recent advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have enabled countless new applications in the domain of aerial sensing. In scenarios such as intrusion detection, target tracking and facility monitoring it is important to reach a given area of interest (AOI), and create an online data streaming connection to a monitoring ground station (GS) for immediate delivery of content to the operator. In previous work, we showed that a multi-hop line network can increase the range of the mission by finding the optimal number of relay UAVs, and their optimal placement. In this demo, we show that CSMA (typical 802.11's medium access protocol) behaves poorly in this type of networks due to mutual interference, and that TDMA is a better alternative. We will also discuss how changing slot width online can overcome typical and less known TDMA inefficiencies, and therefore reach maximum end-to-end throughput and low delay.

In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, a sensor network protocol must satisfy various application-specific requirements such as synchronous, asynchronous, symmetric, and asymmetric operations. Most block design-based neighbor discovery protocols can not support asymmetric operations.

The proposed protocol has better energy efficiency and shorter latency than existing asynchronous neighbor discovery protocols since it is based on optimized block designs.

We exploit the widely available mobility data to divide the urban areas into zones by the joint K-mean clustering in origin and destination spaces. The method is evaluated with the New York City and Shenzhen taxi data, and the created zones are compared with the current static zoning plans of the city to evaluate the effectiveness.

Poster Abstract: Using Low-Cost, Non-Sensor-Equipped BLE Beacons to Track People's Movements
2017 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks
None
2017
This study presents a room-level people tracking system capable of determining people's movements while carrying a non-sensor-equipped BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacon. The BLE beacon broadcasts BLE advertisement while people are in motion. A beacon receiver (BR) was installed in a room near the doorframe to determine people's movements (i.e., entering, departing, or passing by the room), based on the variations in received signal strength (RSS) over time. This system is aimed at providing tracking information for people in school buildings, hospitals, and nursing homes. Knowing in which room or area people are has many useful applications, and the system is low-cost and easy to install and maintain.

Poster Abstract: An Adaptive-Delay Transmission Strategy of a Fixed-Interval Wireless Reporting Application

2017
Low-power wireless technology, i.e., IEEE 802.15.4, consumes less energy and is suitable for battery-powered applications; fixed-interval data reporting is a common characteristic of these applications, e.g., a wireless sensor needs to report its temperature or air quality every minute. However, data-receiving failure occurs frequently because the output power of such wireless technology is low, typically 1 mW in 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4; also, crowd wireless traffic on ISM 2.4 GHz usually has serious radio interference. Meanwhile, data sent from a wireless transmitter but is not received by a receiver is not only wasted energy but also causes potential radio interference with other wireless devices. Based on the observation of radio interference, we proposed an adaptive-delay transmission mechanism for increasing the energy efficiency and the packet delivery ratio of the fixed-interval reporting application. The timing of data reporting is adaptively postponed if the recent transmissions fail. By integrating this method, the number of data packet been sent is reduced by up to 42.7% in a high-interference period; therefore, the power consumption of the wireless transmitter is reduced.

Poster Abstract: Long-Term Monitoring of Cane-Toads Using Acoustic Sensors

2017
Cane-toads (Bufo marinus) are introduced to Australia to negate the insect pests. However, cane-toad population is out of control, and has highly affected native frog species for its great reproductive capacity. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor cane-toads and control their population. Recent advances in acoustic sensors make it possible to monitor cane-toads over long periods. In this paper, we present a novel approach to analyze cane-toad calls for long-term monitoring. Specifically, recorded acoustic data is first transformed into spectrogram using short-time Fourier transform. Then, cane-toad calls are recognized with an oscillation detector. Next, recognized cane-toad calls are annotated for further analysis. Initial analysis of our method demonstrates promising results, with 71.36% true positive rate. With the oscillation detector, cane-toad calling activity is investigated over the whole year.

We present a deep learning framework for fast 3D activity localization and tracking in a dynamic and crowded real world setting. Our training approach reverses the traditional activity localization approach, which first estimates the possible location of activities and then predicts their occurrence. Instead, we first trained a deep convolutional neural network for activity recognition using depth video and RFID data as input, and then used the activation maps of the network to locate the recognized activity in the 3D space. Our system achieved around 20cm average localization error (in a 4m &#x00D7; 5m room) which is comparable to Kinect's body skeleton tracking error (10-20cm), but our system tracks activities instead of Kinect's location of people.

With the advancement in energy harvesting, wireless powered communication networks overcome the problem of replacing fixed energy sources, e.g., batteries in difficult access areas of industrial networks. However, the harvested energy is not always enough to support reliable and low end-to-end data transmission in industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs).

We propose a kernel-level energy profiling tool KLEP that can work with diverse APIs of Android. KLEP addresses the challenges of the tail energy problem and the complex interrelation between hardware components in the device energy consumption profile. KLEP collects energy-sensitive events in the kernel and measures real energy consumption of the device at the same time, and employs a LSTM neural-network-based model for energy profiling. The preliminary results show that the curves profiled by KLEP can match the actual energy consumption with low error and overhead.

Understanding occupancy patterns in a building is very useful to control HVAC systems for improving energy efficiency of the building and occupant comfort. There has been a very little attempt to understand long term occupancy patterns in a commercial space. In this work, we leverage depth sensors (Kinect for XBOX One) to collect occupancy count from an 11,000 square foot commercial space (Bosch office) for nine months. We analyze the collected data and describe key findings that provide deep insights about how a commercial space is used and serve as a guideline to formulate novel and efficient control strategies.

Smart wrist devices available today like smart watches and fitness trackers are usually enriched with inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes that can be used to capture wrist motions. This opens an opportunity to use these devices for user authentication, exploiting an important biometric trait of a user: the wrist gestures during performing a signature in the air. In contrast to traditional authentication methods, the gestures can be captured while signing in the air freely with no need for any input media like keypads and signature capture devices. This paper presents result from a preliminary study that shows the potential of the proposed approach to be used for robust user authentication.

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is the process of learning about both the environment and about a robot's location with respect to the environment and is essential for robots to autonomously navigate. A variety of algorithms using many different sensors such as RGB-D cameras, laser range finders, ultrasonic sensors and others have been proposed to perform SLAM. However, these algorithms face common challenges are that of computational complexity, wrong loop closure detection and failure to localize correctly when robot loses state (kidnapped robot problem). In this work, we utilize Wi-Fi signal strength sensing to aid the SLAM process in indoor environments and address the challenges mentioned above.

In underwater wireless sensor networks (USWNs), localizing unknown nodes is essential for most applications while is more complex than that of terrestrial WSNs. In this paper, we propose a range-based localization scheme using deep neural network (DNN). Numerical results suggest that the proposed DNN localization algorithm outperforms traditional schemes using least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) or generalized least squares (GLS) in terms of localization accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the proposed algorithm requires a small number of anchor nodes, which is plausible for practical applications.

Localization of sensor nodes is important for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) especially for underwater WSNs (UWSNs). Among the existing UWSN localization approaches, reverse localization scheme (RLS) is an event-driven method suitable for underwater surveillance. RLS adopts the strongest arrival or the first arrival as the direct path, which is however not accurate enough due to the severe multipath effect in underwater acoustic channels. We propose median RLS (MRLS) to select the median path and weighted RLS (WRLS) by assigning each path with a possibility to be the direct path for UWSNs. Numerical results have validated the proposed schemes and further suggested that WRLS outperforms MRLS and traditional approaches and is capable to diminish the multipath effect.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms provide situation awareness in tasks such as emergency response, search and rescue, etc. However, most of these scenarios take place in GPS-denied environments, where accurately localizing each UAV is challenging. Heterogeneous UAV swarms, in which only a subset of the drones carry cameras, face the additional challenge of identifying each individual UAV to avoid sending position updates to the wrong drone, thus crashing. This work presents an identification mechanism based on the correlation between motion observed from external camera, and acceleration measured on each UAV's accelerometer.
