This paper describes a family of structured visual languages. The algorithmic one includes constructions for the programming of parallel processes. The syntactical language allows the definition of context-dependent languages. Software supporting the languages is discussed. The environment allows the development of programs in chart dialects of C++, Java and the syntactical language.

The storage and querying of 3D objects for the dynamic composition of VRML worlds
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
The composition of 3D presentations is a complicated procedure partly facilitated by the introduction of VRML. VRML does not yet support 3D object storage and querying, thus introducing limitations to object reusability. Presentations have to be built from scratch while the necessary information already exists from previous work. This paper presents a method to address this issue by providing the functionality for (re)composing 3D interactive presentations. The participating objects are selected through spatiotemporal criteria. The temporal element is included so as to provide a global treatment to virtual (3D space+time) objects. The objects retrieved this way form a repository, and are further transformed in order to satisfy the requirements of the composed presentation. The entire framework complies with the VRML standard.

Virtual reality and augmented reality as a training tool for assembly tasks
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
In this paper we investigate whether virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) offer potential for the training of manual skills, such as for assembly tasks, in comparison to conventional media. We present results from experiments that compare assembly completion times for a number of different conditions. We firstly investigate completion times for a task where participants can study an engineering drawing and an assembly plan and then conduct the task. We then investigate the task under various VR conditions and context-free AR. We discuss the relative advantages and limitations of using VR and AR as training media for investigating assembly operations, and we present the results of our experimental work.

Internet-based teleoperation using VE modelling based on single images
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics

2000
Virtual environment (VE) techniques provide a powerful tool for the visualisation of the 3D environment of a teleoperation work site, particularly when "live" video display is inadequate for the task's operation or when its transmission is constrained, for example by limited bandwidth. However, the ability of a VE to cope with the dynamic phenomena of typical teleoperation work sites is severely limited by its pre-defined model-based nature. Thus, an online composing mechanism is needed to make it environment-compliant. This paper describes a method for this purpose, based on workspace analysis, in which objects are constructed from simple 2D images and VEs are modelled interactively. Experiments have shown that the method is convenient and effective for online VE editing.

Finding and characterising candidate binding sites
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
We present a method for identifying and representing indentations, cavities and holes in a known protein structure. The identification procedure is performed initially. Once a pocket in the protein has been found, we use a boundary representation technique to represent it. Both the identification and the representation procedures rely upon modifications to the Marching Cubes algorithm of Lorensen and Cline (1987), which can be used to give a piecewise planar representation of a three-dimensional object. The identification of a pocket essentially involves finding a point, (x/sub 0/, y/sub 0/, z/sub 0/) say. The point should be such that a sphere of radius r can he centred there, without touching the centre of any atom in the protein, but there exists R>r such that a sphere of radius R centred at (x/sub 0/, y/sub 0/, z/sub 0/) does touch the centre of an atom. If such a point is found, then it is deemed to be in a pocket. The boundary representation technique involves storing information about a boundary in the structure of a graph. The graph structure of a pocket, potential docking site, can then be compared to the graph structure of a candidate binding substrate using standard graph comparison algorithms. The required input for the algorithm is in the form of a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file.

2002
In this paper a visual tool for comparing different mountain pine-beetle management approaches is presented. This comparison tool gives the users the possibility of viewing their information, but more importantly it provides the ability to visually see the similarities and the differences between two simulations. This tool can help users to make decisions regarding their future actions against beetle attacks. The technique used is based on colour indexing combined with the mapping of the strategies into colour histograms. The system is entitled VICO from the phrase Visual Comparison.

A new data distribution method for parallel ray tracing
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
The ray tracing algorithm produces realistic high quality images, but it requires a long time for calculation on a single processor machine, which limits its practical use. With the development of distributed object architectures, such as CORBA (Common Object Request Broker), the most promising way to improve ray traced picture productions seems to be parallelisation, which offers both increased CPU power and memory facilities. A natural way for parallelisation is to distribute pixels over the CORBA object system. However, since we want to deal with large scenes and making our algorithm functional over any parallel architecture system, scene objects have also to be distributed among processors, so a modified parallel algorithm is necessary. We propose a new method, which distributes the scene objects among processors (CORBA objects) according to their speed frequencies, which uses the object coherency property. Our approach of exploiting the bus CORBA gives very encouraging results.

Representations for problem solving: on the benefits of integrated structure
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
How should problem-solving representations for complex knowledge domains be designed? Traditional approaches typically address the problem of semantic complexity by designing systems that offer multiple and often heterogonous forms of representation. The REEP approach advocates structure preserving integration of the different classes and perspectives of a domain within a single representation. This work reports on a novel representational system for nurse rostering that was designed under the REEP approach. An empirical evaluation suggests the kinds of knowledge support provided by the representation and demonstrates that participants prefer fully integrated over selective views of information even though the former increases visual complexity. This knowledge support is explained in terms of more abstract domain independent cognitive benefits that we present as reasons for adopting the REEP approach.

Voromap: A Voronoi-based tool for visual exploration of multi-dimensional data
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
A map of multi-dimensional data is a graphical representation - defined in 2D or 3D space - of a set of data points that reflects similarity relationships amongst them. Triangulations of those points can be produced to generate surface meshes on which additional information can be mapped to visual attributes such as color or height. Such surfaces may then be used to explore the data set and the similarities between the different data points. In this paper we introduce Voromap, an exploration tool that is based on Voronoi diagrams of the projected data, and compare that representation with a standard representation that uses triangulations. Voronoi diagrams represent each element in the data set by the area of a polygon in which every point within the polygon is closer to its generating point than to any other point from the data set. A user experiment was conducted to compare Voronoi maps with equivalent maps represented by surface triangulations explored with a similar triangulation-based tool

Treecube+3D-ViSOM: Combinational Visualization Tool for Browsing 3D Multimedia Data
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper proposes a new visualization tool for browsing 3D multimedia data. This is realized as a combinational visualization tool of Treecube and 3D- ViSOM which are both proposed by the same research group of the authors. Treecube is a visualization tool for hierarchical information developed as a 3D extension from a 2D visualization tool, Treemap proposed by Ben Shneiderman, et. al. in 1992. Treecube is useful for browsing 3D multimedia data stored in a file system because the file system has a hierarchical structure. However, if many data exist in one directory, it is not easy for the user to find his/her required data from it. On the other hand, 3D-ViSOM is a 3D-SOM (Self Organizing Map) based visualization tool for browsing 3D multimedia data. Using the 3D-SOM layout, similar feature data are located in the same area and it is easy for the user to find his/her required data by the browsing. Since 3D-ViSOM can solve the problem Treecube has, the authors propose a combinational visualization tool of Treecube and 3D- ViSOMin this paper.

Stencil: A Conceptual Model for Representation and Interaction
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Existing Information Visualization models provide insufficient support to visualization programmers in creating applications. They either broad and taxonomy based, or narrowly focused on isolated aspects of the visualization problem. Taxonomy based tools are good for categorizing what has been or needs to be done, but provide little help in accomplishing those goals. Narrowly focused models allow particular aspects of the visualization problem to be efficiently solved, but leave heavy burdens for integrating many such narrow tools together to solve the over arching visualization problem. This insufficiency of visualization models is most evident where interaction is concerned: It is often left as an afterthought. In this paper, we describe the Stencil visualization model, an intermediate model that covers many visualization specific issues. We argue that the Stencil model can guide visualization program construction through several stages of common application pipelines; thereby improving the resulting visualization products and reducing significant barriers to visualization adoption.

A Linking Mechanism to Integrate Components of a Visualization Framework

Visual analysis and exploration of data has been extensively studied in various fields. As the amount of data increases, we need scalable and efficient visualization tools integrated with cross-discipline elements to explore and overcome the issues exposed by the large data sets. In this paper, we present our dynamic linking mechanism to create a visualization framework (mVis, multi-visualizer for multi-dimensional data) for visual exploration of large relational data sets. It is an extendable, flexible, and easy-to-use environment. The linking mechanism links co-operating components and data-connected interactive visualizers to the framework. It constitutes object-and event-linkers which are identified by their names so that new external components can subscribe to any linker group easily without compiling the framework.

Network Visualization of Human and Machine-Based Educational Standard Assignment

Rapid growth in the availability of digital libraries of K-12 curriculum, coupled with an increased emphasis on standard-based teaching has led to the development of automated standard assignment tools. To assess the performance of one of those tools and to gain insight into the differences between how human catalogers and automated tools conduct these standard assignments, we explore the use of network modeling and visualization techniques for comparing and contrasting the two. The results show significant differences between the human-based and machine-based network maps. Unlike the machine-based maps, the human-based assignment maps elegantly reflect the rationales and principles of the assignments; i.e., clusters of standards separate along lines of content and pedagogical principles. In addition, humans seem significantly more apt at assigning so-called `methodological' standards.

Visual Clustering of Spam Emails for DDoS Analysis

2011
Networking attacks embedded in spam emails are increasingly becoming numerous and sophisticated in nature. Hence this has given a growing need for spam email analysis to identify these attacks. The use of these intrusion detection systems has given rise to other two issues, 1) the presentation and understanding of large amounts of spam emails, 2) the user-assisted input and quantified adjustment during the analysis process. In this paper we introduce a new analytical model that uses two coefficient vectors: 'density' and 'weight'for the analysis of spam email viruses and attacks. We then use a visual clustering method to classify and display the spam emails. The visualization allows users to interactively select and scale down the scope of views for better understanding of different types of the spam email attacks. The experiment shows that this new model with the clustering visualization can be effectively used for network security analysis.

Angular Treemaps - A New Technique for Visualizing and Emphasizing Hierarchical Structures

2012
Space-filling visualization techniques have proved their capability in visualizing large hierarchical structured data. However, most existing techniques restrict their partitioning process in vertical and horizontal direction only, which cause problem with identifying hierarchical structures. This paper presents a new space-filling method named Angular Treemaps that relax the constraint of the rectangular subdivision. The approach of Angular Treemaps utilizes divide and conquer paradigm to visualize and emphasize large hierarchical structures within a compact and limited display area with better interpretability. Angular Treemaps generate various layouts to highlight hierarchical sub-structure based on user's preferences or system recommendations. It offers flexibility to be adopted into a wider range of applications, regarding different enclosing shapes. Preliminary usability results suggest user's performance by using this technique is improved in locating and identifying categorized analysis tasks.

A Matrix-Based Visualization for Exploring Dynamic Compound Digraphs

We introduce a matrix-based visualization technique for exploring time-varying directed and weighted graphs. Two overview representations are shown: one for the time-aggregated relations with attached quantitative weighted attributes and one for the results of an automatic dynamic pattern identification algorithm, i.e., relations accompanied by categorical attributes. Apart from a dynamic edge pattern categorization, our tool can also compute graph-specific properties---such as shortest paths or the existence of cliques---and highlight their evolution over time. The visualization method is complemented by interaction techniques that allow the user to navigate, explore, and browse the data, based on the Visual Information Seeking Mantra---overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand. If an additional hierarchical organization of the vertices is available, this is attached to the matrix by vertical and horizontal layered icicle plots allowing one to explore the data on different levels of hierarchical granularity. The usefulness of the tool is demonstrated by applying it to time-varying migration data in the hierarchically structured world.

Interactive Similarity Links in Treemap Visualizations

2014
Exploring hierarchical organizations such as software systems is a challenging task. This gets even harder when these are large, deeply nested, and attached by a list of additional attributes of either quantitative, ordinal, or categorical nature. Tree maps have been designed to graphically represent such hierarchical structures in a space-filling way where two attributes for each hierarchy element can be visualized in each tree map box at the same time: by area and by color. Having more than two attributes attached to each hierarchy element can also be visualized by this concept when allowing an analyst to frequently browse the pair wisely represented attributes in the color dimension leaving the box sizes fixed due to mental map preservation. In this paper we enrich standard tree map visualizations by such a browsing feature and additional interaction techniques such as expanding or collapsing them to different levels of hierarchical granularity. To further support the comparison of similar boxes for either one, two, or a list of attributes we add the concept of similarity links whose display thresholds can also interactively be chosen.

Layer-Centered Approach for Multigraphs Visualization
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
Recent advances in network science allows the modeling and analysis of complex inter-related entities. These entities often interact with each other in a number of different ways. Simple graphs fail to capture these multiple types of relationships requiring more sophisticated mathematical structures. One such structure is multigraph, where entities (or nodes) can be linked to each other through multiple edges. In this paper we describe a new method to manage multiple types of relationships existing in multigraphs. Our approach is based on the concept of pair of nodes (edges) and, in particular, we study how nodes on different layers interact which each other considering the edges they share. We propose a two level strategy that summarizes global/local multigraph features. The global view helps us to gain knowledge related to the characteristics of layers and how they interact while the local view provides an analysis of individual layers highlighting edge properties such as cluster structure. Our proposal is complementary to standard node-link diagram and it can be coupled with such techniques in order to intelligently explore multigraphs. The proposed visualization is tested on a real world case study and the outcomes point out the ability of our proposal to discover patterns present in the data.

Why Visualization is an AI-complete Problem (and Why That Matters)
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has infiltrated almost every scientific and social endeavour, including everything from medical research to the sociology of crowd control. But the foundation of AI continues to be based on digital representations of knowledge, and computational reasoning therewith. Because so much of modern knowledge infrastructure and social behaviour is connected to AI, understanding the role of AI in each such endeavour not only helps accelerate progress in those fields in which it applies, but also creates the challenges to extend the foundation for modern AI methods. The simple hypothesis herein is that so-called AI-complete problems have a role in helping to articulate the appropriate integration of AI within other disciplines. With the current growth of interest in "big data" and visualization, we argue that relatively simple formal structures provide a basis for the claim that visualization is an AI-complete problem. The value of confirming this claim is largely to encourage stronger formalizations of the visualization process in terms of the AI foundations of representation and reasoning. This connection will help ensure that relevant components of AI are appropriately applied and integrated, to provide value for a basis of a theory of visualization. The sketch of this claim here is based on the simple idea that visualization is an abstraction process, and that abstractions from partial information, however voluminous, directly confronts the non monotonic reasoning challenge, thus the need for caution in engineering visualization systems without carefully considering the consequences of visual abstraction. This is particularly important with interactive visualization, which has recently formed the basis for such fields as visual analytics.

Amatsubu: A Semi-static Representation Technique Exposing Spatial Changes in Spatio-temporal Dependent Data
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
Spatio-temporal dependent data, such as weather observation data, is data in which attribute values depend on both the time and space in which they are recorded. Typical visualization methods of such data that are employed in mass communication involve plotting the attribute values at each point in time on a map, and either displaying a series of such maps in time order using animation or displaying them by juxtaposing horizontally or vertically. Such methods are widely known, even by non-experts in analysis, but they have some problems. These methods force readers who want to grasp spatial changes in the attribute values to memorize the representations on the maps. The longer the time-period of data, the higher the cognitive load. In order to address such problems, we develop a novel visualization technique, named "Amatsubu," which statically represents multiple instantaneous values on a single map by overlaying them. We confirm the usefulness of this method through user studies, and also determine a weak point. The weakness is a lack of readability of information for each point in time, which can induce misreadings of spatial changes. We attempt to overcome this issue by introducing animation to Amatsubu, and transforming it into a semi-static representation technique. We confirm the effect of this improvement through another user study.

A mobile videophone image codec using wavelets and classified vector quantisation for mobile radio speech channels
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
A bandwidth efficient image codec is offered as a direct replacement for mobile radio speech codecs in second generation wireless systems, such as the Pan European GSM system. The image codec is contrived for Quarter Common Intermediate Format (QCIF) videophone sequences, and uses the 2D orthogonal wavelet transform to decompose the Displaced Frame Difference (DFD), into a four band structure using Quadrature Mirror Filters (QMF). The transformed coefficients are then compressed using classified vector quantisation (CVQ) and then multiplexed to a time division multiple access (TDMA) slot and modulated using Pilot Symbol Assisted Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (PSAQAM). The proposed image codec does not suffer from blocking effects that are visually disjointed and has therefore a major advantage over current discrete cosine transform (DCT) methods. A further advantage of using wavelet based transforms is that they require less hardware and are simpler to implement on a DSP chip than Fourier based methods. The method proposed is suitable for implementation in VLSI technology.

Visualization of virtual architecture

1997
The study constitutes a framework, a justification and a proposal for the opportunity to improve the use and efficiency of visualization of architecture in the virtual environment. It seeks a new platform to define architectural design communication. The design process depends upon creation of models and virtual environment offers the medium of exchange where the design model can be shared and criticized by people other than the designer; various analysis can be applied and the results of both can be used to change or improve the design. Possibilities offered by visualization do not fit into the paper based way of architectural thinking. In order to benefit from the potential of visualization it is required to redefine architecture, architectural design process and architectural terms with respect to the virtual environment. The study introduces a transitional solution between the paper based and the future ways of thinking in architecture by enabling the designers to customize the visualization software according to their purposes.

Visualisation of building maintenance through time
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The use of 3D visualisation has long been established as a major breakthrough in closing the gap between a client's need and what is perceived by the designer to be the need of the client. Nevertheless, construction clients are increasingly demanding a greater participation in the process of design generation. This has been a welcome move by all parties, as less variation means less conflict. In spite of its vast practical uses, in the field of visualisation, the ability to travel through time is an area that has been neglected by the academics and the developers alike. The paper highlights the benefits of the incorporation of the 4/sup th/ dimension-the time dimension-into 3D visualisation. Building maintenance is used as a case study to demonstrate the practicality of the 4D visualisation and its representation through VRML. To this end, the focus is on the lighting, paints and carpets. However, the concept can easily be expanded to encompass the causes and effects of all events on all building components.

Visualization of controllable regions in real-time systems using a 3D-Julia set methodology
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The paper introduces the possibility of the occurrence of chaos in any iterative system, and then explains how the familiar Julia set visualization can be programmed into a graphical tool. Stability on real-time systems occurs in regions of operation and is dependent on the simultaneous values of several parametric values. Because of this, it is very difficult to explore regions of instability in real, non-trivial systems. A variation of the Julia set methodology is presented, based on the corollary between the iterated fate of a function and the final value of a dynamic system. The resultant software is demonstrated on a model of a nonlinear control system, that has been reported to exhibit chaos in its feedback components-but still maintaining primary control. The paper concludes with a statement of how the visualization tool may be applied almost any (mathematically modeled) system in order to demonstrate how its dynamics can be investigated without the need for any other control analysis methods.

Multiresolution data modelling for irregular data fields based on wavelets
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
In many applications of scientific visualization, the data fields are so large that they are very expensive to store, transmit and render. Multiresolution offers a promising new approach for addressing these difficulties on a simple, unified way. Wavelets provide an extremely useful mathematical toolkit for hierarchically decomposing functions in ways that are both efficient and theoretically sound. This paper focuses on extension of wavelet based multiresolution to arbitrary topological data grid. Using wavelet transform, the method proposed here obtains a unique shape description of an irregular data field. A biorthogonal volume wavelet is constructed. Recursive subdivision is applied to irregular data field and leads to a collection of refinable scaling functions and hence to a sequence of nested linear spaces, as required by multiresolution. In order to overcome the subdivision connectivity restriction, an applicable method is presented to convert the completely arbitrary data field to multiresolution so that the technique for creating multiresolution can be used.

A set of parameters to assess the objective quality of visualizations of a voxel-based data set, produced using a ray caster, is proposed as a first step toward the evaluation of the overall quality of these visualizations. Results obtained using synthetic data and a simple implementation of a ray caster are presented. The final goal of this evaluation is the computation of "confidence indices" that could offer the user a "guided visualization\

Normalised grid/motif based patterns-Islamic geometric patterns
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The studies of Islamic geometric patterns (IGP) show that the methods of generation are based on a set of classical gridding systems. They are hierarchical and primarily based on the sacred geometrical primitives (triangle, square and circle). With such patterns, symmetries are as visible as the forms themselves. They signify an obvious secondary meaning that is so often referred to, in the sacred and religious texts, as a higher order of significance. Based on the classical grid system, normalised grid-based patterns propose a new language of design with the further aid of symmetry that hold these forms so robustly. It takes away their hierarchy by replacing it with less tangible forms that are bounded by shear balance of symmetries. An underlined question for the reader is "are we disturbing the semantics of these patterns, the meanings that have been portrayed by the architect, the designers and visualists for a long time through their visual forms?".

Towards a taxonomy of virtual reality user interfaces
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
Virtual reality based user interfaces (VRUIs) are expected to bring about a revolution in computing. VR can potentially communicate large amounts of data in an easily understandable format. VR looks very promising, but it is still a very new interface technology for which very little application oriented knowledge is available. As a basis for such a future VRUI design theory, a taxonomy of VRUIs is required. A general model of human computer communication is formulated. This model constitutes a frame for the integration of partial taxonomies of human computer interaction that are found in the literature. The whole model constitutes a general user interface taxonomy. The field of VRUIs is described and delimited with respect to this taxonomy.

The need for matching visualisation techniques to client understanding in the UK construction industry
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
An empirical study of the methods available for visualisation of proposed building structures was undertaken at the University of Salford. This formed the basis for a structured survey of 103 construction related professionals. Their views were obtained on the mediums currently being used in the construction industry, the effectiveness of these mediums to communicate information; and the applicability of visualisation techniques within their own organisation. The results highlight the need for further investigation and research into visualisation techniques, particularly in connection with the needs and understanding of construction industry clients. This corroborates the findings of the recent Latham Working Groups, who place great emphasis on the need for improved communication and image within the construction industry.

A multi-scale, multi-layer, translucent virtual space
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The dynamic nature of virtual display spaces can provide powerful tools for helping people comprehend phenomena that occur over widely disparate spatial scales. This paper presents the macroscope, an interactive technique for browsing very large spaces of displayed information at different scales. The macroscope takes as a point of departure the traditional 2D zoom and pan operations, but introduces multiple translucent layers to avoid the problem of losing visual context. The third dimension is used to visually separate the layers and provide an external point of view for controlling the presentation. The user can manipulate viewfinders in the virtual space, which control the relative scale and position of the layers.

Depth cueing for augmented reality
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization

1997
Computer-augmented reality systems promise to overcome some of the problems inherent in virtual reality and, in addition, to provide numerous other application possibilities. However, if augmented reality is to become fully practicable a number of hurdles need to be surmounted. Not least of these is the ability to achieve convincing real-time visual integration of virtual objects within real scenes. To this end, it is particularly important that virtual entities appear to exist at their appropriate depth within a real environment. This article outlines an experimental system to determine the efficacy of alternative static monocular depth cues in an augmented reality display.

The Tower of London computer models
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
This computer model was commissioned by the Tower Environs Partnership as part of the technical studies to underpin proposed enhancement of the surroundings of the Tower of London. It is intended to provide a sufficiently fine-grained photo-realistic facsimile to allow fine judgement of minor changes in landscape detail. Its credibility is underpinned by close correspondence to the original survey data and by the ability to compare viewpoints with matching photographs taken on site. These models enable examination of the visual impact of both the Tower Environs Scheme proposals and of projected neighbouring schemes which may affect its setting in the future. Future development of the model is proposed to enable change to be experienced before it is committed, to explore different interpretations of historic evidence, and to forge stronger links to other sources of information. In this way, the model can be used as a unified way of finding out more about the Tower and its surroundings, both in the present and in the past. Through these means a much wider and more varied range of people can gain from using the model, increasing the justification for the resources involved in keeping it up to date.

1997
This paper describes a system that uses visualisation to assist a user in dealing with the information returned from a search engine. The user's queries, and the documents they return, are represented by a 3D spatial structure that shows their relationships and provides a way of accessing and exploring the documents retrieved. It is implemented to work with the New Zealand Digital Library, a set of large document collections that is available over the Web. The visualisation scheme is a Java applet that is updated dynamically whenever the user makes a new search, and can be browsed alongside the search engine.

Image warping based on elastic body spline transformation: application for facial animations
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The warping of scattered data points is a problem that is appearing in science and engineering. The basic problem involves the construction of a reasonable interpolation function that goes through some of the data points. In this paper, we propose a new spatial image warping algorithm which uses an elastic body spline to generate a warp function that interpolates scattered data points. The spline is based on a partial differential equation of Naiver that describes the equilibrium displacement of the elastic body when subjected to certain forces. The spline maps can be expressed as the linear combination of an affine transformation and a Naiver interpolation spline. The proposed algorithm generates a smooth warp that reflects the feature correspondence points. The in-between facial animation from given true facial images could be defined by interpolating the positions of correspondence features and their shapes and colors.

The STARLIGHT information visualization system
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization

1997
STARLIGHT is an example of a new class of information system expressly designed around visualization-oriented user-interface. Incorporating more traditional information storage and retrieval technologies into its design, the STARLIGHT system also enables the integrated use of multiple, concurrent visualization techniques to support comparison of content and interrelationship information levels of abstraction simultaneously. This powerful new form of information analysis eases cognitive workloads by providing a visual context for the information under study. Originally developed for intelligence analysis applications, the STARLIGHT software is intended to support the rapid, concurrent analysis of complex multimedia information, including structured and unstructured text, geographic information, and digital imagery. The system uses novel 3-D visualization techniques that interactively generate easily understandable representations of explicit and implicit relationships contained in information collections of various types. This paper describes the general theory behind our approach, and the design and features of a Windows NT-based operational system.

The role of virtual world design in collaborative working
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
Introduces the concept of Internet-based shared worlds, and certain problems that have been encountered in their use for collaborative working. These problems can be addressed, it is argued, by the use of architectural notions, such as grounding the model in a physical institution and looking at the role of locales in real working environments. The problem of access to these locales is made by drawing a parallel between the structure of the online resources and the structure of physical spaces described in space syntax theory. Results from the latter, it is suggested, can inform the design of virtual spaces to facilitate both privacy and chance encounters.

Meshing and visualization of oilfields
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
To optimize the exploitation of a new oilfield it is necessary to do computer simulations in order to determine the number and the geometrical positions of oil wells. Mathematical models are used to estimate the evolution of the production of an oilfield according to the 3D geometry of this oilfield, the number of wells used, the geometry of these wells and some economical parameters. An important step is to compute and visualize the oilfield meshing adapted to the mathematical method used in the simulation process. After a brief introduction to oilfields engineering, we describe two solutions to mesh the domain. The first one is to use only parallelepipeds as meshes with an algorithmic computation of neighbours, which allows one to efficiently mesh a huge domain when the oil wells are vertical. When oil wells have a complex geometry, we show how to use Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations to mesh the domain. This work illustrates the growing importance of visualization methods in the petroleum industry.

Dunhuang Frescoes retrieval based on similarity calculation of color and texture features
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization

This paper mainly deals with efficient retrieval of Dunhuang Frescoes from large image databases based on similarity calculation of color and texture features. In this paper, we firstly give out a survey of research on Dunhuang Frescoes by artists from all over the world. Therefore, these research achievements can provide us a new clue to organize and manage Dunhuang Frescoes databases, and guide us to find an efficient way to retrieve Dunhuang Frescoes from large-volume image databases. We present a similarity calculation method from multi-source analogy. Then we describe several techniques for extracting the color and texture features of Dunhuang Frescoes. Finally, we calculate the comprehensive similarity between Frescoes using color and texture features. By means of the similarity computation, we can carry on an efficient and fast image database retrieval. A Dunhuang Frescoes retrieval and analysis system demonstrates that retrieval using the combination of color and texture features can assure high precision and robustion.

The note lists some unsolved research problems concerning line (or edge) drawing algorithms for raster displays which seem to be still outstanding in 1997. Work in progress includes the so called "pixel perfect" speeded up versions of Bresenham's (1965) line drawing algorithm designed to exploit the parallel capabilities of modern display processors. Where should the build up of multi-pixel segments be terminated for optimum performance? The representation of circles, conic sections and other curves, by short, straight line segments or "otherwise" by direct generation at the pixel level: what is the "best" chain code definition? Is it "better" to use four-way or eight-way connected outlines? Can one use "strength reduction" to improve the performance of the algorithms when implemented with modern parallel hardware? How can one best convert between the "real" (floating point) coordinates of a real world model and the integer working required at the pixel level? Finally, how can one best use grey scale when it is available to soften the jaggies which so often spoil the appearance of fount outlines and other objects?.

Holographic imaging of lines: a texture based approach
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
Holography is a method for three dimensional imaging of objects. We present an approach for the generation of holograms, exploiting standard graphics rendering methods and hardware. We focus on the visualization of objects composed of line segments, which allow for certain simplifications, and thus hologram generation speedup. Our method is based on the derivation of a holographic geometric equivalent of the object to be imaged. In this equivalent, the object is represented as a set of geometric primitives combined with precomputed textures. The equivalent is built up under prescribed conditions, thus simulating certain wave characteristics. The hologram of the object to be imaged is gained just by rendering its holographic geometric equivalent. Problems of achieving the necessary resolution of the output hologram are addressed.

A library-based 4D visualisation of construction processes
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization

1997
The lack of tools for activity level visualisation of construction projects presents problems to planners when considering the future implications of their decisions. Current research into the application of computer graphics to construction planning goes not as far as the component level of a building. Though desirable, this approach does not match the efforts of planners who have to work at the activity level. The work acknowledges the above problem and proposes a new approach. The paper presents a strategic framework for the realistic visualisation of simulations of construction projects at the activity and component levels. This strategy is based on the use of virtual reality (VR) technology to support practitioners to plan and visualise their plans in a near reality sense. It proposes the use of a pre-prepared library of 3D graphical images of building components, facilities etc. and their related activities which constitutes the 'resource pool' on which this strategy thrives.

Parametric plane curves are expressed as complex valued functions of a real parameter. The method is convenient for investigating Pythagorean-hodograph curves. A complex function transforms one curve to another curve in the complex plane. There are complex functions which preserve the Pythagorean hodographs of the curves. These functions can be used in deforming Pythagorean-hodograph curves. In particular, the Mobius transformation is useful in controlling the deformation.

Information drill-down using Web tools
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization

1997
Reviews the information visualization and interaction techniques needed to add another dimension to surfing the World Wide Web. Information visualization can be used to explore relationships by "drilling down" and retrieving more data within a region of interest in the visualized data, combining data mining, direct manipulation and data visualization with 3D Web tools. It is now possible to create desktop visualization applications that let users interact with databases with larger datasets over the network using both 2D and 3D interaction metaphors. The VRML standard allows users to view and navigate through 3D information data worlds and hyperlink to new worlds. Information drilling based on HTML's image map, VRML's anchor node and multiple predefined viewpoints is explained and demonstrated. The image map in 2D and 3D graphics objects (glyphs, etc.) represents the visual user interface to the information stored in the database. Over the next couple of years, we shall see 3D visualization evolve in giant steps into interactive data drilling on the Web, providing visualization technology closely integrated with the data warehouse and multidimensional abstract and geospatial data models.

On visualisation of statistical data
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization

1997
In many applications a need often arises to represent numerical data to give greater visual impact. Whether the data consists of demographic information or forms a listing of financial business trends, their interpretation and meaning is simpler to comprehend through a pictorial representation. The requirement in practice is such that visualisation needs to take place on-the-fly. This implies that the process of transforming static data into a diagrammatic form needs to be dynamic. Whereas most authors have addressed the scenario by employing cubic interpolation to the given set of data points, we discuss the suitability of using a quadratic approach. We introduce the general quadrature spline, its attractions, and its limitations, together with some thoughts as to how the conic (quadratic) spline could be adapted to meet most needs.

A new algorithm for multiresolution isosurface extraction
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization

1997
We put forward a marching cube algorithm based on the extraction and expression of multiresolution isosurfaces. It can solve the problem of too much and too meticulous triangular meshes on a traditional marching cube algorithm with single resolution. At the same time, under the users' requests, it can apply various precision to different regions of the object to get a compromise between rendering time and image precision. Our algorithm firstly, begins with low resolution images, and gradually extracts high precision isosurfaces from high resolution ones to achieve multiresolution rendering; finally, it establishes the corresponding relationship between different resolution isosurfaces and images. Specifically, the algorithms use a new 3D image encoding method: recursive subdivision wavelet encoding which is more suitable for extracting multiresolution isosurfaces.

The paper presents a technique to allow quick evaluation of the relevance of documents to one's interests. It is designed primarily for presenting documents on the World Wide Web, but it can also be used in other situations. The idea is to automatically highlight selected keywords in Web pages as they are shown. Users maintain lists of keywords of interest to them. At any given time, a user can activate any such list and from then on all words in that list will be highlighted automatically, transparently, and efficiently in all documents. Users can change lists at any time and also control several other highlighting parameters (such as the number of selected words). Extensions of this scheme, where documents are automatically changed in other ways based on readers' preferences, are also discussed.

Developing a virtual reality interface for an integrated project database environment
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
Explores the potential of using virtual reality (VR) as an interface for an integrated project database using the World Wide Web. VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language), which is a Web-based standard, is explored as a means of remotely interrogating information stored within an integrated database. VRML allows the creation of 3D views and worlds which can be explored in real time. This paper describes the steps taken to link the OSCON integrated database to a VRML environment. It addresses the issue of using VR as the medium for the remote accessing of information within an integrated environment. For instance, site engineers can query the database from their sites if they have access to a modem and the Internet. Technologies are now available which can be used to this end. The Internet and its facilities should be exploited for the benefits of better management and retrieval of construction information. VR has often been looked on as a visualisation tool. This paper puts the argument that VR should be used as a user interface. For instance, the user should interact with a 3D column in VR rather than a column in a traditional database environment. This allows the construction practitioners better access to information which will motivate them to use integrated databases. In addition, VR should be used as a vehicle for classifying information. The user should be able to look at the design, costing, time planning and facilities management views according to his/her requirements. This may prove helpful in projecting information from a project integrated database.

Discusses how to train computer graphics-oriented students to be able to use the computer to its full artistic potential, with application both of programming and art-related issues. Students create computer art graphics inspired by scientific concepts, to match the curricular content of other courses they are taking concurrently. The integrative visual training involves both the process and the product of the students' work. Due to the integrative instruction of art and science issues, students might learn about specific subject areas by applying visual thinking and inventing subject-related activities which involve visualizing information. Two main methods of integration were applied: (1) integrative project assignments, aimed at provoking the students to apply visual thinking and learning, and (2) art assignments, inspiring the students to create artwork inspired by scientific concepts.

Architectural composition in the electronic design studio: conceptual design using CAD visualisation and virtual reality modelling
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The paper evaluates the possibilities for the use of computer aided design and desktop virtual reality technologies as tools for architectural composition. An experimental teaching programme involving undergraduate architectural students at the University of Luton, in which aspects of compositional theory are explored through the direct creation of architectural form and space in digital formats is described. In the programme principles of architectural composition, based upon the ordering and organisation of typological architectural elements according to established rules of composition are introduced to the students through the study of recognised works of design theory. CAD and desktop virtual reality are then used to define and manipulate architectural elements, and to make formal and spatial evaluations of the environments created. The paper describes the theoretical context of the work, assesses the suitability of the software used for performing compositional manipulations, and evaluates the qualities of immersion and intuitive feedback which virtual reality based modelling can offer in the design visualisation process. The teaching programme utilises standard software packages, including AutoCAD, and 3D Studio, as well as Superscape VRT, a PC based desktop VR package.

Interactive visual exploration for knowledge discovery on the Web
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization

Presents a conceptual structure for the organization and representation of textual and visual information on the World Wide Web. A generic conceptual structure is proposed which contributes to new forms of visual navigation and interactivity within large collections of textual and visual data.

Visualisation of photovoltaic clad buildings
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The paper describes a study carried out to investigate the capabilities of computer aided design software for the visualisation of building elevations and detail, with focus on the representation of photovoltaic cells in facade architecture. The development of photovoltaic (PV) technology, converting energy from sunlight into electricity, has resulted in the emergence of PV as a building material. This has generated much debate on the aesthetic implications of PV integrated buildings. PV introduces a particularly complex set of requirements not present in traditional cladding materials. As well as the physical characteristics of the material, there is a need to consider factors such as orientation to the sun, and shadows cast by neighbouring buildings. Architects, engineers, developers, clients and the general public all need to be able to visualise proposed designs, either of new or refurbished buildings. This study investigates both the process and end results of computer visualisation in the context of photovoltaic clad buildings.

Automatic abstraction management in information visualization systems
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The construction of information visualization systems is a difficult task. However, there is little research into the provision of software architectures for visualization systems to reduce this difficulty. Particularly, systems that provide a reusable support for the automatic management of the different levels of abstraction in which complex data can be observed cannot be found in current visualization systems. Telescope, an object-oriented architecture for visualization systems is presented. Its main goal is to provide a customizable infrastructure to develop visualization systems allowing the automatic management of the different levels of abstraction in which the visualized information can be observed. Telescope is based on the concept of abstractor objects which provides the generic behavior to support visualizations with semantic zoom capabilities controlled externally through abstraction scales. CityVis, a visualization system for city data, developed using the Telescope architecture, is also described.

Visualization of large volumes of information using different representations
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The visualization of large volumes of information requires mechanisms to reduce the amount of information to be displayed. In this paper, we propose a technique to combine the usage of filters (like the degree-of-interest function) with different, scale-dependent representations. This eliminates the need to create new representations or to use graphical attributes to show the degree of interest of each object. This approach is specially useful when the number of variables is large or the information density is too high. The method can be complemented with zoom mechanisms and distortion of the position of the objects in space, taking advantage of the reduction of the area occupied by those objects with less interest to increase the area available for those with a higher degree of interest, normally located near the focus.

Local convexity preserving rational cubic spline curves
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
A scheme for generating plane curves which interpolates given data is described. A curve is obtained by patching together rational cubics and straight-line segments which, in general, is C/sup 1/ continuous. It is a local scheme which controls the shape of the curve and preserves the shape of the data by being local convexity-preserving. A particular scheme is suggested which selects the tangent vectors required at each interpolation point for generating a curve. An algorithm is presented which constructs a curve by interpolating the given data points. This scheme provides a visually pleasant display of the curve's presentation. An extra feature of this curve scheme is that it allows subsequent interactive alteration of the shape of the default curve by changing the shape control parameters and the shape-preserving parameters associated with each curve segment. Thus, this feature is useful for further enhancing the user satisfaction, if desired.

The paper is concerned with the development of an integrated, open and fully usable virtual reality (VR) environment for the construction industry for use on a low-cost PC (but transportable to other, more sophisticated systems) to make VR accessible and usable by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The paper describes a new VR system for collaborative interaction in the construction industry that enhances communication between the design team, contractors and sub-contractors through open systems design. It discusses how feedback from potential users of these VR systems is assessed and implemented, to ensure systems are designed to meet user requirements. By enabling the use and integration of a wide variety of multimedia technologies, communication channels between different construction parties become more effective.

1997
We present a data flow based software platform called GIVE (General Interactive Visualization Environment). GIVE owns a data flow kernel, a visual programming interface and an extensible module library. It greatly enhances the efficiency of building visualization programs. GIVE has the following distinctive features: it introduces control nodes and procedure nodes into traditional data flow architecture, so it can support complex ViSC application: it is a well opened environment, supported by two efficient interactive tools-GIVE/ME (Module Extender) and GIVE/DE (Data Extender)-which enables users to extend modules and data types into the system freely and conveniently; and it has a module library composed of varieties of modules. We first introduce several concepts of the data flow architecture, then describe the designation of GIVE, and finally discuss the implementation of GIVE.

Shape-based calculation and visualisation of general cross-sections through biological data
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The paper reports a solution to the problem of image interpolation for generating, with high precision, an arbitrary cross-section from a series of slices. Shape-based interpolation as proposed allows the interpolation process to be influenced by the shape of the object. It is accomplished first by creating reconstructed shapes of the objects from a series of slices. Correspondence vectors distributed along the object surface are then generated from the reconstructed shapes. These vectors ensure the correct image interpolation on the boundaries of objects. Next, the correspondence vectors are interpolated to every image point within the new cross-section in process, and the image points at the start and end of a vector are linearly interpolated. Places where the correspondence vectors cannot be (branching or holes in the object shape) are treated separately. Results are presented from biological data obtained using an optical microscope. The data indicate that the proposed method produces more accurate results than commonly used interpolation methods, although at the cost of increased computation.

Feature based 2D shape transformation
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
The transformation or blending of one 2D shape into another usually operates on sets of discrete points approximating the objects. This relies on a series of evenly distributed or properly positioned points on the boundary of the objects. Characteristics of the objects are not well considered. This paper presents a technique for transforming or blending shapes represented as a series of curve segments. Transformation of the shapes is attained by establishing correspondence between pairs of features of the objects. Based on an estimation of the sharpness of a corner on the boundary of a 2D contour, vertices are generated on sharp corners of the shapes and hence dividing the boundary of the shapes into elements. Correspondence between the elements of the shape is then established before the correspondence between points on the elements is established. This allows special features of the shapes to be retained in the blending operation which is essential in product and industrial design.

Binary space partitioning trees: a multiresolution approach
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
Space partitioning techniques are a useful means of organizing geometric models into data structures. Such data structures provide easy and efficient access to a wide range of computer graphics and visualization applications like real time rendering of large databases, collision detection, point classification, etc. Binary space partitioning (BSP) trees are one of the most successful space partitioning techniques, since they allow both object modeling and classification in one single structure. However, with the advent of networked graphics applications, there is an increasing need for multiresolution geometric representations. The paper presents a novel method that extends BSP trees to provide such a representation. The models we present have the advantages of both BSP trees and multiresolution representations. Nodes near the root of the BSP tree store coarser versions of the geometry, while leaf nodes provide the finest details of the representation. We present different algorithms to construct multiresolution BSP trees in 2D. Then we propose extensions of our methods to 3D space.

Multi-modal surface/outline projection and simulation of target/critical tissue movement
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
Conformal radiotherapy delivers high radiation doses to tumours whilst minimising damage to normal tissues. Therapy planning makes use of treatment simulation and computed tomographic images, which outline gross tumour volume and a dosimetric model. The larger planning target volume includes microscopic disease spread, target motion and set-up errors, effectively determining radiation beam collimation. High energy portal images are used to verify collimation and targeting. Software has been developed to integrate all the above features, allowing clinicians to interactively simulate motion effects and test the robustness of conformal planning. Multi-modality coregistration in 3D enables surface projection of modelled tumour/normal tissue volumes. Projection models are constructed from morphologically defined CT outline frames which are then B-Spline skinned. The biological effects of visualised motion can be explored at near real time rate.

Designing of curves and surfaces using cubic splines with geometric characterization
Proceedings. 1997 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization
None
1997
A constructive approach has been adopted to build interpolatory and B-spline like cubic spline curves with a more general continuity than /spl beta/-continuity. This method provides not only a large variety of very interesting shape controls like biased, point and interval tensions but, as a special case, also recovers a number of spline methods like /spl nu/-spline of G.M. Nielson (1974), /spl beta/-splines, /spl gamma/-splines of W. Boehm (1995) and weighted /spl nu/-splines. The curve schemes have also been generalized to produce smooth surfaces with local shape control. The local shape control has been achieved by introducing variable shape parameters.

Non-negative rational spline interpolation

1997
Scientific visualization is one of the important areas of computer graphics. This paper is concerned with non-negative C/sup 1/-interpolation of non-negative data for visualization proposes. Using the rational cubic spline function of Sarfraz et al. (1997), necessary and sufficient conditions have been derived which ensure the generation of a non-negative curve through given non-negative data. In addition to the pleasant display, the scheme provides extra freedom to the users to play with the shape of the curve to modify it according to their desire. This is done through controlling the default curve within the derived constraints.

Given measurements of the positions of a number of marked points on a rigid body at a sequence of times t/sub i/ (i=0, 1, ..., n), we represent the motion of the body, assuming this motion to be smooth, by means of piecewise-rational curves, one through each sequence of positions, sharing a common denominator and having the property that the distance between these curves always remains constant. We consider in detail the motion in 2D and 3D of a rigid rod marked at each end.

1998
Summary form only given. The New York subway has becomes the site for a 3D animation simulating reality in an extraordinary environment. A sense of digital time travel is accomplished through the synthesis of 3D animation with computer graphics, real-time video and an original soundtrack. The content is a portrait of energy, both human and mechanical, where the digital architecture of the subway and trains are contrasted with real-time, videotaped New Yorkers in transit. TOKEN CITY began as a collaborative work by the authors. The content evolved from the common experience of both artists, whose aesthetic histories have been influenced by subway iconography and sounds, in the creation of an animation accompanied by an original score. The 3D computer animation was created on a Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) workstation using Alias Wavefront-EXPLORE software. Modeling forms, texture mapping and motion creation were accomplished on the SGI. Subway billboards, mosaics and surface textures punctuating the animation were created separately on an Apple Macintosh platform and exported to the SGI. The animation files were output to a laser videodisc.

Architecture as alchemy: changing documentation languages and their translation into built forms

1998
The paper explores the research potential of a multimedia database called 'Simulated Site Visits' to record the translation processes which occur between architectural documentation drawings and their built form. This is a significant area for research, as computer visualisation is transforming design and documentation techniques. 'Simulated Site Visits' allows records of the construction process, which is normally concealed once building is completed to be linked to architectural documentation drawings and other records in a four dimensional framework. This non-linear reading of different media, facilitates the study of links and gaps between architectural drawings and their built form. It is a recent and radically different format for recording, retrieving and reviewing information developed. The research and teaching concepts were developed by the author and the computer interface strategy was developed by Jonathan Finkelstein, also from the University of Melbourne.

In our minds, we can create an imaginary environment of shapes and objects. A natural and intuitive way to externalize these imaginary shapes is through our hands by simply sketching or tracing their outline in space. If we could capture and then interpret our hand shapes, then we would be able to express spatial information in computer-generated graphical environments in a simple and extremely powerful way.

Illustrates the application of a 3D multiple dataset visualisation tool to a small relational database. The system itself is built around the concept of data containers. These are dynamic regions in 3D space which provide the ability to view multiple datasets using alternate visual paradigms in a dynamic visual querying environment. This system therefore proposes a technique for the exploration of databases through the use of a navigable 3D space. Key concepts under demonstration include multiple dataset visualisation, nesting of alternate visual representations and zooming of detail through the use of aggregates. It is also shown how the containers may be used to develop query chains and to construct meaningful 3D representations of dataset collections.

A real-time 3D object modeler using a small subset of implicit functions for object modeling is described in this paper. It is suitable for 3D soft object modeling. The models can be created interactively while they are being rendered. This overcomes the traditional difficulty of applying implicit functions in real-time object modeling. The modeler is implemented using object-oriented programming techniques on SGI workstations using Open Inventor. Object-oriented design patterns have been used to form the overall modeler environment. The layout of the modeler can be formed by editing it using a script language without compilation. The object models created are compatible with the VRML format.

Dynamic surface matching for patient positioning in radiotherapy

1998
Curative radiotherapy of localised cancer delivers discrete doses of radiation to diseased tissue over many days. Computer driven multileaf collimators now closely conform radiation dose fields to the shape of any tumour. This technology invites the reduction of beam margins in order to maximally spare healthy tissue, reducing side-effects, but placing more emphasis on the precision of dose delivery. However, tumour motion and body surface variation demand more accurate patient set-ups. Software has been developed to assist in the task of aligning a patient on the treatment couch with his/her previously planned CT scan in true three-dimensions. A body surface height-map is constructed from a B-spline skinned model of the planned CT scan outline set and compared with a height-map from an optical sensor. This type of co-registration does not depend entirely on skin surface markers which unavoidably move due to the dynamics of internal/external anatomical forces.

A piecewise rational cubic spline curve has been described. The designed curve possesses parameters (weights) in each interval which can be used to control the shape of the curve. A very simple distance-based approximated derivative scheme is presented to calculate the control points.

The scheme is local, easy to implement, and suitable for plane as well as space curves.

Nowadays, constraint solvers play a fundamental role in many graphical applications, including geometrical and mechanical CAD systems, layouts, user interfaces and animation. These applications use constraints to conveniently describe the relations between objects. Constraints are automatically maintained and satisfied by a constraint solver. So, numerical and tedious tasks are left to the solver and the designer can concentrate on the design process. In this paper, we present the concepts of constraints and constraint solvers. We classify the principal resolution methods, giving their drawbacks and shortcomings. We also examine different application domains using constraint solvers.

Analysis and visualization of properties of free-form surfaces

1998
The purposes of this research are to analyze and visualize some properties of aesthetic surfaces and to construct the shapes, which satisfy designers' intentions. To extract and visualize the properties, surface edges of a free-form surface were introduced. The edges are loci of the points that have the extremum values for characteristics of the surfaces such as curvature, height, brightness and so on. By analyzing idea sketches drawn by styling designers, we find that the designers' intentions are closely related to the contour curves and the surface edges. The results of this research give fundamental technology not only to classify features of free-form surfaces but also to generate an aesthetic shape according to the styling designers' feelings.

Experiments in animation control by neural networks
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
The use of neural nets with an associated learning paradigm was investigated for the purposes of animation control. Neural control schemes were set up and used to control simple skeletal figures. In most cases, the methods eventually converged to a controller that performed very well, even when the learning algorithm became trapped at local minima. However, there is a limit to the learning rate, or else instability arises. Nevertheless, a useful model of the inverse dynamics of the controlled object can be captured fairly quickly, but fine adjustments take some time. Most skeletal figures one might want to control combine kinematic redundancy, inherent instability and limited controllability, and the unicycles studied had all of these properties. This meant that a new neural control scheme had to be devised. The inputs of the neural net were taken from both the reference trajectory and the status of the object being controlled, whilst initially only attempting to control part of the object. Additional experiments were carried out successfully with a weak conventional controller that simply let the unicycle fall over, producing a natural learning mode in which the unicycle begins by falling over and gradually gains the skill required to stay upright and control its motion as training goes on. Conventional control schemes in Cartesian space were also considered. After some experimentation with direct user control of the torques and the reference input, an intuitive control scheme that combined the neural controller and a trajectory generator was defined. Quite realistic and elegant motion was eventually achieved.

Part of teaching architecture and building students about building construction involves taking them on to a building site where they can observe, first hand, some of the techniques used to assemble buildings. One problem with this sort of teaching is the availability of accessible building sites. The SSV (Simulated Site Visits) system has been designed to teach students about the process of constructing a building through multimedia, thus reducing the need to physically visit construction sites. SSV combines the potential of multimedia, the easy-to-comprehend interface of virtual reality and the organisational capacity of relational databases. Although limited by slow networks, SSV is capable of delivering its information through the Internet to a world-wide audience. SSV can also be seen as a method for the long-term storage of information that could be applied to other disciplines.

Solid model abstraction using form features
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
Solid model abstraction is an integral part of parallel and process design. It is required for simulation and optimisation of the design and consists of retrieving a simplified model from the solid one, with appropriate dimension reduction and details removal. Unfortunately, current CAD systems do not provide the means for easy simplification of forms. Ongoing research efforts on abstraction yield some possible approaches. These attempt to generate the abstract model using expert systems, medial axis transforms or medial surfaces. A feature-based approach is presented. Analysts usually think about objects in terms of sets of forms rather than in terms of geometrical and topological entities. So, given an object and its description in terms of form features, the approach constructs a simplified model of this object using morphological information of the form features. The abstraction process has two parts: simplification and idealization. The simplification part removes any non-pertinent features from the initial model, while the idealization part idealizes the resulting objects according to the goal of the analysis.

Visualisation of GIS data in VR related to cognitive mapping of environment
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
The main concepts of a design tool and its testing supported by visualisation of GIS data in a VR system are described. The design tool should improve architectural design with respect to analysis and improving existing and planned urban environments regarding several quality criteria, especially those associated with visual aspects. Preconditions for defining the design tool's purpose are the determination of the "well-situated" urban elements, their impact on cognitive mapping, and the exploitation of this knowledge on cognitive mapping for the improvement of urban environments. Cognitive mapping is a kind of representation of schematic knowledge that a person has about familiar environments. A cognitive map is stored information or knowledge concerning the purpose and function of the environment. This leads to the conclusion that an urban environment design which takes the process of cognitive mapping into consideration, will be experienced by most people in the same way. Investigations of this process result in a theoretical model of elements of urban environments, their relationships and their dependencies. The theoretical platform of the tool is based on design theory, cognitive science and computer science. Design theory and cognitive science are used to develop the theoretical model. This theoretical model together with computer science are the basis for tool development.

Improving interactivity within a virtual sculpting environment
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics

1998
Computer animators find that maintaining control of the shape of deformable objects during motion is sometimes difficult. This paper describes a system called "Gargoyle" which provides improved support in this area; it concentrates particularly on the form of interaction between user and computer. In Gargoyle, an object is sculpted at several predefined key positions which are associated with particular values of the parameters defining the surface. This allows the object to be animated by parametric interpolation in the conventional way. Within a two-handed stereoscopic environment, an object is modelled by "holding" it in one hand, while the other hand uses the mouse to sculpt the object (as if it were made of clay) using a "point-and-click" technique, rather than the conventional "pick-and-drag" approach. Several tools are available and, with each click of the mouse, the current tool is applied to the surface at the indicated point. The algorithms underlying the tools are outlined, and various objects which have been sculpted using them are described.

On encouraging multiple views for visualization
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
Visualization enables 'seeing the unseen', and provides new insight into the underlying data. However, users far too easily believe or rely on a single representation of the data; this view may be a favourite method, the simplest to perform, or a method that has always been used. A single representation may generate a misinterpretation of the information or provide a situation where the user is missing the 'richness' of the data content. By displaying the data in multiple ways a user may understand the information through different perspectives, overcome possible misinterpretations and perform interactive investigative visualization through correlating the information between views. Thus, the use of multiple views of the same information should be encouraged. We believe the visualization system itself should actively encourage the generation of multiple views by providing appropriate tools to aid in this operation. We present and categorise issues for encouraging multiple views and provide a framework for the generation, management and manipulation of such views.

1998
Desktop virtual reality (VR) can be used to explore new housing developments before construction, but for advanced visualisation techniques to become widely used, the concerns of the housing industry must be heard. At Loughborough University, a prototype visualisation of a residential development was produced, and then shown to different types of housing developer to obtain feedback regarding the relevance of the approach as well as suggestions for future developments. After giving an overview of current CAD and visualisation use in the industry, this paper presents the practical VR work done and the conclusions drawn from interviews with housing developers following presentation of this work.

A recursive approach to parametric surfaces containing non-rectangular patches
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
A method is presented which is capable of capturing surfaces of arbitrary topology. Derived from standard bicubic B/spl acute/ezier patches, it "fills in" n-sided regions with four-sided patches. It is based on a recursive patch-midpoint subdivision algorithm on a rectangular framework of control points, which is then generalised to arbitrary control-point nets. At each step, a new set of points with more vertices and smaller faces than the original set of points is constructed, resulting in a smooth surface. This structure provides the foundation for a general method to construct a smooth surface where the structure contains non-rectangular patches.

Real time multi-user interaction with 3D graphics via communication networks
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics

1998
There is a lot of development currently being carried out on cooperative visualization via communication networks. User interaction is kept to minimum in this kind of development, such as only making marks on the transmitted images, etc. There is relatively less work being done on complicated cooperative interactions, especially real-time cooperative interaction via networks. The work presented in this paper is a challenge to this type of cooperative work. The objective of the system is to allow multiple users to design a 3D scene cooperatively via communication networks in real time. The paper describes the design and communication model of the system, the design and implementation of the protocol to transmit changes in the 3D scene, the database consistency techniques and the implementation of the 3D editor interface. The current implementation status of the system shows that a real-time, full user interaction in 3D cooperative design via communication networks is achievable by our design strategy.

A realistic material model for reflectance simulation
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
In order to simulate the correct behavior of light incident on a material, we must first understand the different interactions not only between the light and the surface of the material but also between the light and the inner structure of the material itself. Physical measurement is a way to record a material's behavior, but is limited to pre-existing objects and measurement conditions. Therefore, we have developed a multiresolution material model, generically describing its inner structure thanks to a microelement distribution. Then we use this model in a virtual measurement bank in order to record its response to an incident luminous radiance. Once obtained, this directional reflectance is stored, compressed and used in a rendering model such as ray-tracing or radiosity.

Diversity of edge information using complementary filter banks analysis

We present the complementary filter (CF) banks, a signal processing technique for image processing. The two-dimensional (2D) multirate signal processing theory and complementary filter properties are the base of CF bank design. Procedures to design nonseparable complementary filters for an alias free decimation are presented. The conditions under which perfect reconstruction is achieved with 2-channel bank of filters, using complementary filters are given. Perfect reconstruction is guaranteed when a CF bank is implemented using a quincunx filter and sampling and although no perfect reconstruction for others methods, the analysis and synthesis are performed free of aliasing. We show that CF banks and Wavelet representation are related. The CF banks are implemented with images and their performance is analyzed. The CF banks were applied for edge detection and examples of diversity in edge information obtained for different types of filtering are shown.

Curve fitting and design by optimal control methods
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
The theory of optimal control is introduced as a new approach for handling curve fitting and design problems. Optimal control provides a uniform formal framework for stating and solving multiple problems in computer-aided geometric design (CAGD). As a result, new classes of curves are defined and known problems are analyzed from a new viewpoint. Often, families of curves which are defined by a minimization problem rely on parameters. Such problems are an appropriate base for handling curve fitting and design by optimal control methods. The methods suit a wide variety of problems. They are demonstrated on three applications of curve fitting and design: smoothing /spl nu/-splines, smoothing interpolating splines and approximating curves. All the applications are treated and solved using the uniform framework. The solution technique is based on the relaxation method.

A visual approach to the analysis of curve profile: a case in construction industry
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
There are many qualitative and quantitative techniques which have been used for a variety of cases of curve fitting, smoothing and forecasting. All but a few have considered curves from a shape-geometry point of view. The paper argues that curve geometry contains characteristics that are descriptive of the nature of the subject area and therefore provides a viable alternative for the generation of a forecast. In spite of its importance for the success and survival of construction contracting companies, cash flow forecasting and management hasn't been extensively studied by researchers or practitioners. The increased research activity in this field during the 1980s failed to result in the development of a universally accepted alternative to the traditional method of time-related elemental cost build-up. Many of these attempts sought to develop a viable alternative by focusing on mathematical approaches. The non-mathematical approaches to forecasting expenditure flow of construction projects offer a clear explanation as to the origin and nature of the resulting forecast, whereas the mathematical approach to forecasting has the advantage of being simple, cheap and fast. These, mutually exclusive features of the different approaches to model development have lead this work to investigate the possibility of developing a mechanism for mathematical models to facilitate some degree of understanding about the behaviour of project expenditure profile and hence overcome the black-box nature of the mathematical solutions.

Level of data-a concept for knowledge discovery in information spaces

1998
The visualization of large volumes of abstract information requires mechanisms to support the user by knowledge discovery. Therefore, we have developed the "level of data" concept, in which the abstract nature of the data and the diverse user community has been taken into account. By using the "iceberg" metaphor, we classified the information space into several layers. The different backgrounds and analysis purposes of the users yield various views on the data. With these different perspectives on the iceberg, the levels of data can be pointed out. For proving the level-of-data concept, we developed a system for the interactive visualization of share prices as a representative example of abstract information. With the integration of this concept, it is possible that any user can perform any analysis within a single system.

Visualisation in the field of dentistry has not, thus far, reached the same development as other medical fields. Potential applications of visualisation techniques in this area, however, are many, ranging from educational displays to training for delicate procedures. This paper reports on the investigation of techniques for handling 3D models of teeth, aiming at the investigation of dental structures. An algorithm was implemented for this purpose, which reconstructs 3D teeth models from 2D contour slices. Results employing various data sets are presented, including the output of VRML models for exploration.

A rational spline with tension: some CAGD perspectives
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
It is often necessary to represent a hand-drawn shape accurately. Modeling such shapes manually is both cumbersome and commercially expensive. The user's concern for curves that are easy to manipulate has been a major influence on the development of free-form curves. Rational parametric curves have been receiving considerable attention in the area of geometric modeling because any parametric polynomial curve can be expressed as a rational curve and most polynomial splines have rational extensions. Rational parametric curves can be used to model any object, like ships and airplanes, and even in the medical field for modeling the heart or other parts of the body. In object modeling, the rational cubic spline is most popular because it is the lowest degree that can define space curves and curves with points of zero curvature. The foremost objective of this work is to show how conic sections can adequately be used to represent curves and objects that were previously thought to require rational cubic splines. A single rational cubic curve is represented by two conics by splitting the rational cubic at its mid-point. The degree of smoothness has been taken into account to have a visually pleasing effect. It has been realized that the conic representation is advantageous over the rational cubic one in terms of computational requirements and shape control. All of this work is carried out on both 2D curves and 3D objects.

WWW access to analogue environments? [Digital urban models]

1998
Digital urban models have been in use in the UK and elsewhere for over 10 years. This paper addresses some of the practical difficulties which are encountered in seeking to enable World Wide Web (WWW) access to these models. Such difficulties include: copyright of the models themselves; ownership of the data which underpins the models; the accuracy of that data; reliability of the models for purposes which cannot be effectively predicted or controlled; methods of enabling remote users to link their data to the model; levels of detail and file size; audit trails, tracking and playback; standards for the agreed incorporation of new modelling into existing contexts; and sponsorship or payment for use. It is suggested that the lack of effective solutions to these difficulties are responsible for the prevalence on the WWW of multimedia imagery published from such models rather than the readily available VRML output.

Visualisation of impact of time on the internal lighting of a building

1998
The visualisation of an object, such as a building, 'in time'-viewing it from different perspectives-has been the subject of many research and development efforts, and significant inroads have been made in this area, which is supported by a sophisticated software technology. On the other hand, visualisation of a building 'though time'-viewing it as it ages or gets younger-has received little attention. In a previous publication by the authors (Proc. Int. Conf. on Inform. Visualisation, London, England, 27-29 Aug. 1997), this concept was introduced and applied to the building maintenance programme. The overall process was modelled and generalised, and lighting, paints and carpets were introduced as examples where the research work can be applied. This paper concentrates on the lighting system and determines the time-related behaviour of different light sources under the impact of intrinsic and environmental factors. This process is modelled and expressed in a mathematical form which facilitates its visualisation through the use of VRML.

An integrated virtual reality and case-based reasoning model for training in building pathology
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
It has long been recognised by building surveyors that training a surveyor is both time-consuming and relatively risky. Universities and colleges recognise the difficulties of taking groups of students to inspect a property because of health and safety, insurance liability and organisational considerations. This paper proposes a solution to these problems by developing a virtual reality package that helps students to learn how to survey a building. Using a virtual environment to train young surveyors in building pathology should help to improve the effectiveness of young surveyors' reports and reduce the possibility of litigation. With the aid of virtual reality models and digital camera images, it is hoped that a package can be developed to enable students to carry out a building survey without leaving their desktop. The prototype is centred on a 19th Century detached house as a virtual environment that students fly through looking for pre-programmed defects. The defects portrayed in the environment are taken from real-life examples or cases. The user identifies the precise nature of the defect by examining a more detailed part of the environment as he/she flies closer to the surface where the defect is located. The cases of defects are programmed into the environment using a case-based reasoning application. The main deliverable is a prototype which, if successful, will be developed into a full educational application.

An application of computer visualisation for solving a mechanical design by fuzzy set

1998
A computer visualisation application has been presented for the fuzzy evaluation of windscreen wiper systems which must satisfy several requirements. Some requirements are modelled by fuzzy sets, and a compensating arithmetic mean is utilised for computing the overall performance. A computer animation of the wiper mechanism motion and rainfall is shown, which enables experts, drivers and passengers to evaluate their degree of satisfaction and the correctness of their judgements. This fuzzy evaluation approach is illustrated by considering five "subjective" requirements (driver visibility, passenger visibility, wiped surface, visibility sensation and trouble sensation), and three design alternatives (traditional single- and double-wiped systems and a variable course system). The results are shown.

Generating a surface including an n-sided patch so as to cover an n-sided hole

While parametric surfaces are most conveniently described by rectangular patches, most complex objects require the use of patches with other than four sides. Many methods to generate such patches are widely used, but all have drawbacks. The paper describes the creation of a surface which covers the original surface and the non-rectangular "hole" with a new smooth surface. The method employs the recursive splines described by Savva and Clapworthy (ibid., 1998) and can be used with a control mesh of arbitrary topology. Further control of the shape of the patch covering the "hole" can be achieved by user manipulation of a "controller" point on the patch.

Splines based on four-point Bezier cubic arcs show some disadvantages compared to general conic arcs. Efficient rendering and data fitting algorithms require that the cubic be expressed in algebraic form, but there are problems in the conversion from the parametric form because of a singularity associated with a special case, the parabola. In conversion from the general conic to the Bezier cubic format, on the other hand, the authors note that the arcs of an ellipse can be well approximated, but not sharply turning hyperbolic arcs.

The Department of Technical Graphics at Purdue University offers a unique Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree program designed to prepare students for a professional career in applied computer graphics. Graduating its first class of students in 1993, the B.Sc. program blends the rigor of math and science with the demands of art, design and communication in preparing students for emerging career opportunities based on computer graphics. The success of this program is due in part to an abiding commitment by the program's faculty to start students with 3D computer graphics and visualization at the very beginning of the program and to continue the integrated use of 3D throughout. The objective of this paper is to establish a philosophy and rationale for structuring an entire degree program based on an interactive 3D paradigm for learning.

Information visualization on the Web
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics

1998
A thin client, by definition, has minimal software requirements necessary to function as a user interface front-end for a Web enabled application and raises the issue of client vs. server data visualization rendering. Real-time visual data manipulation does not translate well into a thin client. While the VRML file format allows distribution of visualization scenes to the Web, the user has no access to the actual underlying data source. The mapping of numerical data into geometry format (VRML) takes place at the server side. Local data manipulation, information drill-down technique, context sensitive menus, object picking and other interactive user interface functions that traditionally have been available on the client are now controlled by the visualization server. In the thin client model, nearly all functionality is delivered from the server side of the visualization engine while the client performs very simple display and querying functions. Web components and plug-ins are now being used to overcome some of these limitations. Java allows the creation of applets and JavaBeans and we have Windows/COM components. These components together with data reduction methods can significantly increase the data interaction between the client application and user, and allow tasks to be executed on the client. Highly interactive user interface tasks are delivered that provide point-and-click navigation through multidimensional data structures. Visual data interfaces such as information drilling, moving a cutting plane through a volume data set etc. can be supported. The implication of using a static VRML environment with reduced geometry is compared to sending compressed data to the client and perform interactive client data visualization on a desktop.

Evaluating three-dimensional information visualization designs: a case study of three designs

1998
A number of 3D information visualization designs have been invented during the last few years. However, comparisons of such designs have been scarce, making it difficult for application developers to select a suitable design. This paper reports on a case study where three existing visualization designs have been implemented and evaluated. We found that the three information visualization designs have inherent problems when used for visualizing different data sets, and that certain tasks cannot be supported by the designs. A general methodology for evaluation is presented, which comprises the evaluation of suitability for different data sets as well as the evaluation of support for user tasks.

A significant amount of rework in construction is caused by clients' last-minute changes and their inability to acquire a realistic appreciation of the product from the 2D drawings at the design development stage. This paper introduces a computer system that enables a user to construct a 3D design model efficiently using object models stored in graphical element libraries. The system allows the user to 'walk through' the 3D design so that the client and the user can have a realistic appreciation of the product before it is built.

Generation of quadrilateral meshes from triangular data with resulting smooth surface reconstruction
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
A new method for surface reconstruction from an initial triangular mesh is introduced. The method transforms the mesh to a quadrilateral one and then builds a smooth surface on top of it. This approach is efficient for large collections of triangular patches, including difficult situations such as sharp junctions and n-patch vertices. During the reconstruction process, the number of mesh elements is considerably reduced. The possibility of parallel computation makes the method efficient in practice. The method is illustrated by building several free-form surfaces from a triangular mesh.

1998
Shares some experience in designing a practical walkthrough system for indoor environments. We discuss issues from the design of efficient utility programs for building 3D models to the design of a walkthrough engine. Our utility programs allow the creation of the interior of a several-storied building in a few man-days. We also propose several rendering speedup techniques implemented in our walkthrough system. Tests have been carried out to benchmark the amount of speedup brought about by different techniques. One of these techniques, called dynamic visibility, proves to be more efficient than existing standard visibility preprocessing methods.

Splines on the sphere

There are many problems that involve data fitting of sets on the surface of a sphere, many of them for example in the geosciences. They are usually treated using some kind of mapping onto the plane, in order to later apply some method for the plane which is well-known and proven. This means precision loss in some zones and problems at the poles. We propose a new method that treats the set of data as three-dimensional, and we show some of its advantages.

This paper presents an algorithm for approximating the sky brightness of a clear sky with sunshine. The sky light and the light reflected from the ground are approximated by a finite set of parallel light beams. The long-term simulation is considered by averaging the radiance of the lights over a certain time period.

A CDM (cognitive design medium) is defined as a medium which supports the cognitive nature of design in computerized environments. We review the theoretical background and demonstrate the basis upon which an interactive counterpart can be achieved in supporting the cognitive capabilities of the designer, such as visual thinking. The approach is elaborated and illustrated by experimental work in the area of conceptual design. We define three phenomena related to visual thinking in design which are characteristic of conceptual design: ideation, re-representation, and the evocation of generic representations. Finally, we demonstrate through examples how interactive computational environments can support these cognitive design phenomena.

Multimedia as a competitive success factor in textile and apparel industry
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics

1998
This work is based on the assumption that severe difficulties may be found because of the generality of the agents in the textile process chain, during the implementation of "quick-response" strategies. These difficulties run through the inertia that characterizes the establishment of partnership relations between those different agents, as well as the communications between them. Therefore, multimedia may be presented as the one of the most complete solutions aiming at the establishment of an adequate communication policy between clients and suppliers, namely at the commercial and product development level. This paper presents different solutions, already developed or still under development, which use multimedia technologies aimed at rapid access to information about consumer's desires.

Multiresolution ordered meshes
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
Geometric models of high complexity are rapidly becoming commonplace. These models are usually represented by means of complex triangle meshes that create three important problems: visualization, transmission and storage. Interest in multiresolution representation is very keen, because it is an efficient method for addressing these problems. We propose a new data structure: multiresolution ordered meshes (MOM), with low storage cost, and an efficient algorithm to extract any level of detail. Meshes are stored in order, depending on the simplification process. It allows one to work interactively with highly detailed models and to transmit them progressively over a communication line. The model construction is very simple because the data structure is based on lists, which can be easily implemented with arrays. Moreover, the extraction of a given level is linear with respect to the number of triangles at that level.

An application model for scientific visualization in hydrologic basins management
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
Scientific visualization is a science of great importance nowadays. There are already several visual techniques, but in the field of hydrological basins there are still many questions to be answered. There is no computer application model that uses scientific visualization techniques as a key for information transmission in this scientific area. Another important aspect is that hydrological basins imply geographical data too. This means that GIS techniques and potentialities should be also considered. As a matter of fact, there is a lack of proper computer models in this area. Such a model should include some of the emerging hybrid aspects that are appearing in scientific visualization and in general systems design. It should combine GIS and scientific visualization techniques properly. This paper introduces a computer application model that can be used to develop an application for hydrological basin management, defining its general architectural model, processes, software and hardware supports, and visual and cognitive models.

An analysis technique and an algorithm for line clipping
Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
1998
A mathematical model for the expected-time analysis of line-clipping algorithms is proposed. Assuming that all clipping windows are equally likely, we demonstrate that the probability of a line segment being totally outside the window approaches the value of 8/9, provided that the line segments tend to be short and evenly distributed within a rectangle. Acceptance-rejection matrices are introduced for a machine-independent comparison of algorithms. A new line-clipping method, called QuickClip, is also proposed. QuickClip is not only simpler and more concise than the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm, the most widely used method in computer graphics, but also faster both in terms of machine-independent analysis and timing results on random line segments. Timing results also indicate that QuickClip is significantly faster than the Nicholl-Lee-Nicholl (1987) algorithm. The theoretical results generalise to 3D, with the important consequence that the average clipping volume is 1/27 of the volume of the model.

In recent years, geographic information systems and spatial database technology are fast spreading across the tight circles of experts, working in the fields of geography and geodesy. In the first wave, GIS functions have been built into engineering applications, which were not just GIS centered (as for example road design, emission calculation, building site-plan etc.). The use has been accelerated through the component technology, which simplifies the insertion of GIS components into a variety of applications-including administration. We describe the upgrading of the business information system of the Slovenian road administration: basic application user interfaces were enriched with a specialized GIS component, which enables a fast and clear (geo)graphical view of the data about the selected part of the road network. The simplicity of using this intelligent digital map (as we named this specialized component) makes it possible to effectively and clearly display the relevant information, which is so necessary in the process of decision making. Besides, there is no need to leave the application the user is familiar with.

Decomposing a simple polygon into simpler components is one of the basic tasks in computational geometry and its applications. The most important simple polygon decomposition is triangulation. Different techniques for triangulating a simple polygon were designed. The first part of the paper is an overview of triangulation algorithms based on diagonal insertion. In the second part, we present algorithms based on Delaunay triangulation. The basic ideas and approach for each algorithm are presented. Finally, some representative algorithms are compared by efficiency.

The Delaunay constrained triangulation: the Delaunay stable algorithms
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
Delaunay triangulation is well known for its use in geometric design. A derived version of this structure, the Delaunay constrained triangulation, takes into account the triangular mesh problem in presence of rectilinear constraints. The Delaunay constrained triangulation is very useful for CAD, topography and mapping and in finite element analysis. This technique is still developing. We present a taxonomy of this geometric structure. First we describe the different tools used to introduce the problem. Then we introduce the different approaches highlighting various points of view of the problem. We focus on the Delaunay stable methods. A Delaunay stable method preserves the Delaunay nature of the constrained triangulation. Each method is detailed by its algorithms, performances, and properties. For instance we show how these methods approximate the generalised Voronoi diagram of the configuration. The Delaunay stable algorithms are used for 2.5D DEM design. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the use of topographic constraints in a regular DEM without adding new points preserves the terrain shape. So the resulting DEM can be more easily interpreted because its realism is preserved and the mesh still owns all the Delaunay triangulation properties.

Conic representation of a rational cubic spline

1999
A rational cubic spline with a family of shape parameters is discussed from the viewpoint of its application in computer graphics. It incorporates both conic sections and parametric cubic curves as special cases. The parameters (weights), in the description of the spline curve can be used to modify the shape of the curve, locally and globally, at the knot intervals. The rational cubic spline attains parametric C/sup 2/ smoothness, whereas the stitching of the conic segments preserves visually reasonable smoothness at the neighboring knots. The curve scheme is interpolatory and can plot parabolic, hyperbolic, elliptic, and circular splines independently, as well as bits and pieces of a rational cubic spline.

Visualisation of data from an intranet training systems using Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML)

This paper describes the design of a generic computer-based training information system (TIS) and visualisation of the data that it generates. Today's desktop training applications are delivered over the Internet to users who can exploit this flexibility and train when and where they like. However, the training manager or the author of the training material require a record of who has been trained, when they were trained and what kind of progress they made. The TIS coordinates this by remotely recording each training session, then sending a small summarising session database back to a central collection point for collation and subsequent analysis. Because of the large amounts of data that this generates in large companies we are beginning to use virtual reality for analysis and presentation of training results. Described in this paper are the results from a session of monitored intranet training that was undertaken by approximately 60 students over a one week period.

Using rational motions it is possible to apply many fundamental Bezier spline (or B-spline) techniques to the designs of motion. The paper develops and tests a simple automatic algorithm for representing C/sup 1/ smooth motion of a rigid triangle /spl Delta/ in R/sup 3/, by means of piecewise parametric rational curves of degree 2m/2m for some m, when measurements of the positions of the vertices of the triangle /spl Delta/ at a sequence of times t/sub i/, i=0, 1, ..., n, in R/sup 3/ are given. The method presented in the paper can be applied to various problems in computer animation as well as in robotics.

The paper describes an investigation of the generation of surrealistic spaces that aim to achieve a new communications environment in which people can mutually convey their thoughts, mental images, and passions. Passion images here can be compared with conceptual images in the analogy of "logos versus pathos". Our focus was on the phenomenon of synesthesia, and the results shown are of the testing of color image creation involving "tanka" (i.e., 31-syllable Japanese poems), aiming at the generation of images where some passions are reflected rather than concrete scenes imagined from word meanings. In addition, the paper proposes an application that judges the similarity of pieces of music, showing the possibility of making instant, subjective judgements without the need for a performance.

Visualisation of construction costs and techniques of employment-intensive road construction in developing areas

Employment generation in the construction of economically efficient infrastructure can contribute to the alleviation of poverty. Practical Choice of Technique Analysis (COTA-P) is a tool that enables decision makers to estimate the financial and socio-economic costs involved in a construction. COTA-P looks at the construction from an employment-intensive perspective, with the underlying idea to substitute as much labour for machines as is feasible, and to promote the use of local labour in underdeveloped and poor areas. COTA-P consists of a technical screening phase, a financial and socio-economical screening phase, and thirdly the monitoring and evaluation phase. Each phase analyses the possibility of the enhanced use of labour. COTA-P is programmed in a Windows 32-bit environment, and gives the user maximum user friendliness, while allowing for extensive manipulation of the core variables and parameters, thus enabling the user to analyse various scenarios in a short time.

Models for visualization are important, helping the developer and user to understand the visualization process; to follow the connections and the data paths through the system; and to reference and compare the functionality and the limitations of different systems or techniques. Display models specifically classify the data by what type of output can be created. Bertin, J. (1962) described a symbolic reference model that he used to describe images and displays. We review his and other 'display orientated models' describing important aspects of these methods and ideas. We then translate Bertin's scheme into an algebraic form as a method to describe visualizations.

To study the three-dimensional evolution of a CA model of a sandpile as a function of control parameters, a computational steering approach was used. Sandpile profiles are calculated in real time and displayed in three dimensions simultaneously with the evolution plots of state variables. This represents a generic problem of multiscale structure in data sets derived from nonlinear systems. The software modules were developed in OpenGL/sup TM/ and the Glut/sup TM/ library and will ultimately be implemented in semi-immersive VR on ImmersaDesk/sup TM/.

The paper investigates human cognitive performance when information is presented via augmented reality (AR) and overlaid upon a primary display. Initial results support traditional experimental paradigms of human memory (G.A. Miller, 1956) and comprehension of information (C.D. Wickens, 1992), and have been used to compare AR and standard display formats when used in isolation. Results from these experiments provide a fundamental baseline for cognitive performance with a see-through AR headset. Furthermore the results lay the foundations for more comprehensive trials later in the research programme when the display formats are combined to provide a full AR facility. Consideration is given to the specific effects of cumulative clutter and two experiments are outlined that investigate the effects on target identification. Although the data are still being analysed, further consideration is given to key points addressed in the experimental design. Details of a dedicated Web site are provided where information will be consolidated and provide a basis for developing guidelines for the future development and application of AR technology.

Ultima Ratio-a visual language for argumentation
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization

1999
In the third act of Shakespeare's Hamlet, the hero is unsure whether to kill Claudius-the assassin of Hamlet's father-or not. He argues that if he does kill him, Claudius who is praying at that very moment goes to heaven and if he does not kill him Hamlet's father is not revenged. A contradiction. Ultima Ratio aims at formalization and visualization of argumentation for agents. An agent is constituted by a set of arguments and assumptions. Facing a particular world, the agent's believes may be inconsistent triggering a rational monologue to deal with the situation. Formally, we define a framework for argumentation based on extended logic programming under well-founded semantics. The system serves as decision support and is capable of detecting and removing contradictions and deriving conclusions of the agent's arguments. To demonstrate the structure and dynamics of the agent's argumentation, we visualise the process as dynamic construction of proof trees. The paper includes screenshots of the logical engine and the visualisation unit as exhibited at the computer arts exhibition Ars Electronica 98.

Architects and other designers use diagrams to visualize the process of product analysis and synthesis. The paper outlines a new pictorial representation tool that helps designers visualize the process of composing and classifying their final products. Finite state automata (FSAs) are used in the context of formal languages as recognition devices. In this sense, they complement the synthetic device of linear grammars in the definition of regular languages. Using the paradigm of language for understanding the design process, FSAs can be developed to describe how basic shapes standing for elements or subsystems can be put together into meaningful subsystems or systems. They can classify different options for component grouping. Compared to flow charts, FSAs represent graphically a class of flow charts that share a set of predefined criteria. In addition, FSAs allow the representation of recursive as well as topological and spatial relations among components.

Visual intelligence is a process that provides information visualization technology to address the challenge of discovering and exploiting information. For innovative companies, visual intelligence applications are improving their decision-making capabilities by performing spatial and multivariate visual data analysis and providing rapid access to comprehensible information. This paper examines the issue faced by most business-how to turn data into understandable business knowledge, and make this knowledge accessible to persons who rely on it. The role of information visualization techniques and the visual user interface (VUI) in the overall visual intelligence process is assessed. The integration of data warehousing, information visualization, Web and new visual interaction techniques will change and expand the paradigms of current work of humans using computers. Visual intelligence will improve visual communication that takes place in all elements of the user interface and provide decreased "time-to-enlightenment".

A robust image mosaicing technique capable of creating integrated panoramas
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
Existing featureless image mosaicing techniques do not pay enough attention to the robustness of the image registration process, and are not able to combine multiple video sequences into an integrated panoramic view. These problems have certainly restricted applications of the existing methods for large-scale panorama composition, video content overview and information visualization. In this paper we propose a method that is able to create an integrated panoramic view for a virtual camera from multiple video sequences which each records a part of a vast scene. The method further enables the user to visualize the integrated panoramic view from an arbitrary viewpoint and orientation by altering the parameters of the virtual camera. To ensure a robust and accurate panoramic view synthesis from long video sequences, we attach a global positioning system (GPS) to the video camera, and utilize its output data to provide initial estimates for the camera's translational parameters, and to prevent the camera parameter recovery process from falling into spurious local minima. Our proposed method is not only suitable for video content overview but also applicable to the areas of information visualization, team collaborations, disastrous rescues, etc. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

As distinct from virtual reality, which seeks to immerse the user in a fully synthetic world, computer-augmented reality systems supplement sensory input with computer-generated information. The principle has, for a number of years, been employed in the head-up display systems used by military pilots and usually comprises an optical display arrangement based on part-silvered mirrors that reflect computer graphics into the eye in such a way that they appear superimposed on the real-world view. Compositing real and virtual worlds offers many new and exciting possibilities but also presents some significant challenges, particularly with respect to applications for which the real and virtual elements need to be integrated convincingly. Unfortunately, the inherent difficulties are compounded further in situations where a direct, unpixellated view of the real world is desired, since current optical systems do not allow real-virtual occlusion, nor a number of other essential visual interactions. The paper presents a generic model of augmented reality as a context for discussion, and then describes a simple but effective technique for providing a significant degree of control over the visual compositing of real and virtual worlds.

A method for deforming polygonal shapes into smooth spline surface models
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
The paper describes a new spline formulation that supports deformation of polygonal shapes into smooth spline surface models. Once a polygonal shape with underlying rectangular topology is specified by the user, it is deformed into a smooth surface that interpolates all the polygonal vertices. The user can then modify the default smooth surface by increasing or decreasing the amount of deformation, either globally or locally. This is accomplished by interactively controlling the shape parameters associated with the polygonal vertices. This modeling paradigm is conceptually simple, and allows C/sup 2/ continuous surfaces to be easily designed, even by a novice user.

Three dimensional animation of Web access behavior using indirect mapping
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
The paper proposes and discusses a 3D animation method for helping us to comprehend the behavior of Web accesses. The proposed method uses dynamic system modeling because human beings live in a dynamic world and they have been trained to comprehend the world since their birth. The method maps the Web access data to mass and forces in a dynamic system model, then simulates the model, and renders the results as graphical objects in the 3D space. An animation tool using the proposed method has been developed. It is implemented with the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) and the Java programming language, and it works on a Web browser. The features and functions of the tool are described, and some snapshots of animations of a Web server log are presented.

Towards a consistent distributed design: a multi-agent approach
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
This paper reviews existing methods and techniques addressing the problem of mismatch control in distributed collaborative design. In order to contribute towards a more comprehensive solution a basis for a taxonomy of design mismatches is presented. The paper argues that a multi-agent approach is a more effective, and a promising, way forward towards a reliable automatic solution to the problem. An outline multi-agent architecture is proposed. The architecture assumes that the design knowledge is encapsulated within the different members of agent community. Agents are endowed with the capacity of negotiation with one another to ensure that any mismatches are detected and that a solution is proposed. The notions of proactiveness and social ability, which the agents need to exhibit, are central to this work.

1999
The VR-DIS system is a design application for the building and construction industry (VR-DIS stands for Virtual Reality - Design Information System). The user interface is characterised by a mixed representation of the task domain. A pictorial representation of the appearance of the building is combined with a visualisation of the formal description of the design. The latter visualisation is worked out as a highly interactive 3D graph in which relation types are mapped on distinct planar directions and the browsing history is visualised in the third dimension. We discuss the theoretical foundations of the interface as a whole and those of the developed 3D graph.

Visualization and information: a building design perspective
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
Virtual reality (VR) packages offer good visualization capabilities but inadequate facilities for either internal data management or data exchange with other packages. The potential usefulness of VR packages for industrial and business applications is limited by their lack of support for the manipulation of specialist information. Their generic nature cannot retain the complex semantics and syntax of industrial information. Within the iterative process of building design and visualization, support is required for construction industry data, which is ordered in a complex and domain specific manner. Improved transfer of data from specialist building design tools to virtual reality has been investigated in previous research, but in this paper it is argued that data transfer is not enough. Virtual reality techniques need to become available within the specialist buildings design tools and alter the interface to such applications.

Data and metadata for finding and reminding
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
The paper discusses the benefits of using document metadata that exists as part of the document and which is also generated by its use, to assist users in retrieving the document and remembering what it contains. By extracting valuable descriptive information from a document, and analysing what a user does, such as the files they open, when they are used and for how long, a repository of information can be built up to help users with the tasks of finding and reminding. Since such a vast quantity of raw metadata can be acquired, visualisation is needed to elicit meaning from it.

A design, simulation and visualization environment for object-oriented mechanical and multi-domain models in Modelica
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
The complexity of mechanical and multi-domain simulation models is rapidly increasing. Therefore new methods and standards are needed for model design. A new language, Modelica, has been proposed by an international design committee as a standard, object oriented, equation based language suitable for description of the dynamics of systems containing mechanical, electrical, chemical and other types of components. However, it is complicated to describe the system models in textual form, whereas CAD systems are convenient tools for this purpose. We have designed an environment that supports the translation from CAD models to standard Modelica notation. This notation is then used for simulation and visualization. Assembly information is extracted from the CAD models, from which a Modelica model is generated. By solving equations expressed in Modelica, the system is simulated. A 3D visualization tool based on OpenGL visualizes expected and actual model behavior, as well as additional parameters. The environment has been applied for robot and flight simulation.

Within the Visualization project of the Austrian Joint Research Initiative (JRI) Numerical Simulation in Tunnelling (SiTu), the Tunnelling Visualization System (TVS) is being developed, to display information in tunnelling. The aim of the Project is to implement a user friendly visualization system, where the data can be displayed in a way that tunnelling engineers can understand. Virtual reality techniques are new in tunnelling and offer a lot of new possibilities. 3D scalar fields are visualised in a novel way. The data to be visualised are either results from numerical simulation or ones describing geological features. Such data have special properties, which have to be considered by the visualization system. The paper presents innovative techniques for this purpose.

A semantic-centric approach to information visualization
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
A semantic-centric approach to information visualization is described in this paper. In contrast to the conventional document-centric approaches, the semantic-centric approach focuses on the intrinsic connectivity in an information space beyond the boundary of individual documents. The approach aims to visualize the profound interrelationships perceived by the scientific community through the literature. An application of this approach is demonstrated through an author co-citation analysis of the entire collection of the ACM Hypertext conference proceedings over the last decade. Sub-fields, or specialties, in the field of hypertext are visualized based on the results of a factor analysis of author co-citation patterns. Nine snapshots of annual author co-citation maps introduce a new way of knowledge discovering in an information space shaped by the contemporary literature.

The new coming era of the WEB represents a challenge in the development analysis of software systems, incorporating new technologies to access and present information, that combines 3D images, sounds, video, and text, in a way that the user gets involved in the interaction with it. This is known as non-immersive virtual reality. Reusing software to solve such problems is then necessary. On the other hand there are no other known specific methods and/or techniques for the development of applications on the WEB.

Virtual reality techniques are being used to support the development of unmanned space probes intended to land on other planets in the solar system. These planetary landers will operate autonomously during landing and will use vision for navigation and guidance down to a safe landing spot. Suitable vision techniques have been developed but must be extensively tested on realistic test surfaces. A system (LunarSim) for producing realistic simulations of heavily cratered planetary surfaces has been developed to support exhaustive testing of vision guidance software. The paper begins by describing the reasons for developing a realistic simulation of the lunar surface. The techniques that have been used to produce models of impact craters are then described. A description of the LunarSim software is provided and an example is presented of an image sequence produced using LunarSim. Finally a summary of related current and future work is given.

The Reorderable Matrix is a simple visualization method for quantitative tabular data. The paper examines how first-time users interact with the Reorderable Matrix and how well they perform a simple task of finding correlating attributes. Visualizing a set of data is a common task in various activities such as decision making or opinion forming. Typical situations are a person making business related decisions, a doctor examining test results of a patient or an engineer making choices between different constructs. All these situations involve examining complex data interactions in a limited time. In this experiment the participants were interacting with the Reorderable Matrix for the first time and tried to find correlating attributes from an unfamiliar set of data.

Continuous field visualization with multi-resolution textures

A method of using a texture mapping approach to color scales is described, for the purpose of visualizing continuous field scalar quantities. The technique is most appropriate where high gradients are present in the data, or where geometric surfaces are projected to significant screen area. The use of texture mapping takes advantage of widely available 3D display systems for interactive visualization system design. The technique yields a significant reduction in visualization artifacts caused by color interpolation. Multiple resolution textures are shown to improve visualizations of high dynamic range data.

Occlusion culling using minimum occluder set and opacity map
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
The aim of occlusion culling is to cull away a significant amount of invisible primitives at different viewpoints. We present two algorithms to improve occlusion culling for a highly occluded virtual environment. The first algorithm is used in the pre-processing stage. It considers the combined gain and cost of occluders to select an optimal set of occluders, called minimum occluder set, for each occluder. The second algorithm uses the improved opacity map and sparse depth map for efficient run-time overlap tests and depth tests, respectively. Without using pixel-wise comparison, this algorithm uses only three integer operations to perform an overlap test, and carry out a depth comparison sparsely. Both algorithms have been implemented and applied to test a model composed of about three hundred thousand polygons. Significant speedup in walkthroughs of the test model due to our algorithms has been observed.

A general approach to constraint solving for declarative modeling domain
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
Research in declarative modeling started some years ago, and important progress has been accomplished and different orientations have been studied. However, some fundamental problems are not exhaustively explored: the role of constraint solvers in maintaining the scene; detecting the incoherence and contradictions between constraints; reducing the number of generated solutions by dynamically adding new constraints. Our main contribution concerns declarative modeling with constraints. We have developed a constraint solver called ORANOS that offers an extended model of constraint satisfaction problems. The solver supports two independent domains of artificial intelligence research: hierarchical constraints and dynamical constraints. The former offers efficient solving techniques for over-constrained problems; the latter allows development of interactive applications. These essential features allow the solver to extend the range of declarative modeling applications.

Towards a feature-based interactive system for intelligent font design
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
The desire to computerise and accurately represent contours of characters has seen an increased emphasis as more and more applications endeavour to seek benefits from the digital form. The latter lends itself to be exploited by fast processors and the resulting output to be displayed not just on electronic devices such as computer monitors and laser printers, but also on numerically controlled machines. These in practice are used to generate desired outlines on paper, metal, plastic or wood by means of cutting and engraving. The process of computerising font outlines, however, embodies the common problems of domain change approximations and truncations. In the case under consideration, the capturing phase is best undertaken by means of mathematical splines, where a series of spline segments are connected together to form a computer model of the original. The digitisation phase of representing the modelled image on a finite resolution output device tends to be the more dominant concern. This is not just because of the transformation process (going from semi-continuous to discrete form), but also because the resulting image needs to embrace the distinct features of a font, has to be aesthetically acceptable, and requires to be in a form which is legible. This paper attempts to address some of the concerns encountered by modern typographers. It reports on a development of an interactive system to facilitate a feature-based design approach. This uses geometric constraints to express spatial relationships within, and between, font features.

Application of collaborative supported frame accurate animation for bridge construction project
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
During a civil engineering construction process many types of professionals are involved, such as engineers, constructors, designers, clients and so forth. To provide mutual understanding among construction workers and to unify their ideas, the creation of an effective presentation is necessary. In addition, the construction process has to work relatively in harmony with the situation of the construction site. Moreover, the use of computer graphics (CG) can help to clearly visualize sequences of the construction process, simulate changes in the execution of the project and carry them out smoothly before the construction begins. The paper introduces the application of Frame Accurate Animation (FAA) as an important implement for construction management. It also explains the use of FAA in an illustrative example of the Sashiki Bridge (provisional name) construction project in Kumamoto. Our main expectation is for the work environment to become more cooperative, efficient and safe.

The paper demonstrates how NURBS-based Free-Form Deformations (NFFDs) can be used to generate and sculpt NURBS based objects in a way that avoids many of the limitations of ordinary FFDs. A system is described in which the user interacts with the NFFD through a set of direct acting tools, removing the need to manipulate the mesh directly. As the user applies the tools to the object, the NFFD is updated automatically. Objects are represented as isosurfaces of the NFFD volume, giving a good insight into the way an NFFD would deform a general object.

VRML-based environments can be used very effectively for reaching a variety of online courses. This paper describes the development of an Internet-based collaborative learning environment in which VRML is not only the means but also the subject of teaching. Such a VRML environment is designed to assist and support employees of the 'new media' industries enrolled on short courses run by the Interactive Media Group in the School of Computing, University of Plymouth. This paper focuses on some key issues in the design of the VRML teaching environment and using it for real-time and on-demand course delivery. One of the most interesting issues is the experience of learning and teaching VRML while being within a VRML world. Such an immersive method of learning provides students with unique experiences and significantly increases the efficiency of the learning process.

A comparative study of environmental cognition in a real environment and its VRML simulation (Virtual Reality Modelling Language)
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
The paper investigates the acquisition of environmental cognitive knowledge in a real world and its desktop VRML simulation. It focuses on the effect of design background and gender on spatial cognition in both displays. A post-rest-only control-group design is used examine to what extent a desktop VRML simulation provides users with cognitive data that is comparable to real world experience. Results indicate that there is a between-group agreement and disagreement depending on the typology of space. Participants using desktop VRML could provide cognitive distance estimations that are equivalent to their counterparts in real world.

Distributed Information Sharing for Collaborative Systems (DISCS)
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization

1999
With the advent of global competition, greater numbers of organisations require collaborations with others. Concurrent engineering can provide a highly effective framework for this collaboration. A distributed object oriented concurrent engineering system (DISCS) focuses on the communication of data between the members of a distributed project team. Conceptually the communication is the enabling factor; technologically the use of the WWW and object oriented technologies. A portfolio of collaboration support tools facilitates practical mechanisms for information sharing within the distributed enterprise, communication/conferencing for project teams, configuration/version control and workflow structures. DISCS effectively facilitates the virtual team, currently within an engineering context.

Multi-model verification of patient positioning in radiotherapy
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
Conformal radiotherapy uses multi-leaf collimation to customise radiation dose fields to the three-dimensional shape of the target tumour. Its effectiveness is governed by the precision of dose delivery achieved using a few coplanar tattoo markers. During a course of treatment, the patient's body surface profile fluctuates causing the reference skin tattoo markers to move and hence, without the ability to verify target position, the precision of pretreatment set-ups will degrade, often significantly. Cross-modal patient set-up verification software has been developed which allows the user to examine images from various modalities. All imaging modalities available can be used to collectively define anatomical landmarks, outlined on a representative reference image in order to verify radiation field placement using anterior and lateral pre-treatment portal images. This software is presently being used within a national clinical trial for recording the field placement error observed daily at pre-treatment.

The purpose of the paper is to design an asynchronous online and offline multimedia learning environment for the learners. The learners include those students in school and graduate people in work. It provides the learners with an interesting and vivid environment for self study. The learners are able to systematically study the selected course however/whenever they like. The environment includes text, graphics, pictures, audio and video in order to provide the users with an easy and comfortable learning environment. The body of the subjects is well-designed by both the software tools and hardware facilities, such as hypermedia hierarchy, motion pictures, Video on Demand (VOD) films, and equipment for online interaction. The software is popular and freely shares with other users in the net. Creative Engineering Design (CED) is selected as a pioneer in developing such an object oriented lesson in the environment.

There is still little knowledge about what factors important for the usability of a 3D user interface. We have performed a comparative study of three 3D information visualizations as a step towards a better understanding of this. The study involved 25 volunteer subjects, performing three different tasks with the Information Landscape, Cam Tree, and Information Cube. The results of the study indicate that the subjects were significantly faster with the Information Landscape when compared with both other visualizations. The Cam Tree was significantly faster than the Information Cube. Our observations during the study indicate that local and global overview are extremely important factors. We also observed that custom navigation is crucial in 3D user interfaces. Finally, the study raises the question: "for what types of tasks is a 3D user interface best suited?".

Visualizing real estate property information on the Web
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
We have designed and are implementing a system called ReV (Real estate Visualiser) for exploring real estate property listings on the World-Wide Web. Given the large number of different Web sites providing listings, each with its own presentation format, and the high dimensionality of the property space itself, it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive single view of property data on the Web. ReV addresses this problem by using grammar induction techniques to automatically learn to parse pages from new Web sites and collate all of their listings together. It them visualizes this listing data using a map based color coding technique. This work draws together a number of strands from the fields of information visualization, machine learning, and database integration. We also hypothesize that ReV will be adaptable to inducing structures from other types of Web data.

The mathematics of shape-geometry approach to the analysis of curve profile
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
It has been previously shown that the visual approach to the analysis of the behaviour of growth patterns can provide a viable solution to the understanding of the physical behaviour of the subject matter. Also, it has been demonstrated that the shape of the profile can be defined in terms of a number of characteristics some of which are general for all profiles and others are specific to individual circumstances. These characteristics, referred to as shape-parameters, are used for the analysis of the profile. Also, they are used for construction of the profile that the phenomenon is likely to assume. The method was validated by applying it to construction project expenditure pattern forecasting and further validation was undertaken by the use of statistical technique, namely, principal component analysis. In this paper, the mathematics of the model is represented whereby, for a given set of shape-parameters, the precise profile is mathematically generated. Due to its complex nature, the problem is decomposed into separate modules each satisfying a number of requirements. The modules operate independently but when combined, the overall boundary requirements are also satisfied.

2D texture refinement using procedural functions

In computer graphics, aliasing is a problem which is always present when discrete elements are mapped to continuous functions or vice-versa. Although there is no general solution for this kind of problem, there are many techniques that aim at reducing the effects of aliasing. The article first discusses how interpolation methods are usually applied in order to correct this problem and shows the limitations of those techniques. It then presents another solution for this problem, that can be used together with the interpolation. It increases the texture details, making use of procedural functions.

An analysis of architectural visual reasoning in conceptual sketching via Computational Sketch Analysis (CSA)
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
Visual reasoning in design is facilitated by sketching. This research investigates how designers sketch, specifically analysing the physical details of mark making. It relates the graphical representations to the abstract cognitive processes of architectural design. A new form of protocol analysis has been developed using video and computer records of designers' sketching activity. The analysis of the resulting data compares the designer's retrospective commentary and interpretations of the sketching activity with the computer's record of that activity. The analysis will lead to a greater understanding of the relationships between 'Design Events' and 'Graphical Events' and thus how the notational activity of sketching supports the cognitive activity of conceptual design.

Pseudo-real-time phenomenon in an augmented distributed virtual environment (ADVE) with lag

The paper introduces the actualization of a new communication channel under a pseudo-real-time phenomenon, in an augmented distributed virtual environment (ADVE) framework through the implementation of a prediction feedback loop (PFL), upon the existence of the unavoidable lag derived from the natural and artificial temporal factors. By implementing PFL, the ADVE framework is enriched with predictive characteristic where it is able to predict and display information of a remotely controlled avatar (virtual body) in the ADVE. Based on the predictive results, interactions between a locally controlled avatar and a remotely controlled avatar in the ADVE can be carried out smoothly, effectively and strategically under an illusory real time phenomenon without influence from the existence of lag. With this pseudo-real-time channel, we would like to bring forth a new era of effective man-to-man virtual communication over the network without inefficiency caused by the unavoidable lag, whether it is solvable or unsolvable.

Organizing and visualizing related work events on personal information management systems
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization

1999
This paper proposes a method to automatically organize and visualize related work events as a work-project structure. This is accomplished by accumulating and analyzing the target event and time of the user's operations such as registrations and references on a personal information management system (PIM). Our processes for organization are: (1) extracting relations between events from the records of user's reference operations using balloon-help function, (2) intensifying the relations between events during interaction with the user by visualizing the relations and presenting them to the user, (3) making connections between events based on the extracted relations. Our visualization method represents the organized work events as connected graphs in which nodes and arcs indicate events and relations between events, and in which the intensity of the relation is represented with arcs of width in proportion to the intensity. Furthermore, in order to visualize a structure of collaboration among several users, our visualization method places each user's connected graph on the side planes of a three-dimensional multi-angular prism.

Triangle mesh compression for fast rendering

None
1999
Modern GIS (geographic information system) application programs and simulation systems have to handle large datasets for rendering. Currently, three dimensional rendering hardware are facing a memory bus bandwidth bottleneck problem at the graphics pipeline. One general solution for this problem is to compress the static three dimensional geometry in a preprocessing phase. We present a new mesh compression/decompression algorithm for this application. Our compression algorithm breaks down a triangle mesh into a set of triangle strips and vertex chains. After decomposition, we encode vertex connectivity with entropy encoding. Our algorithm provides a 32% improvement in the compression ratio over existing "Generalized Triangle Mesh (GTM)" compression and supports parallel decompression. We also proposed a parallelogram prediction method for vertex coordinate compression.

The paper appraises the role of Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) based 3D computer based urban and heritage models in assisting professional collaboration on common tasks and engaging the participation of the general public in decision making. The University of the West of England (UWE) have created such models of both a significant area of central Bristol and for the Tower of London. The model and associated information can be interactively viewed through low cost WWW browsers and updated online. The model is held to be a useful analogue for linking available information in more accessible form. Use of an underlying geographic information system (GIS) allows other information to be readily associated with elements within the models. The costs of creation and ownership of traditional and digital models are compared with those of GIS generated models. Developments are discussed to improve and ease collaborative creation and use of such models.

Information highlighting

1999
The paper reports on an empirical study in which, for the purposes of developing an automatic highlighting tool, 11 subjects were asked to highlight important passages in an 1111-word text. These results were cross-referenced with a range of word attributes in order to test hypotheses about the principles underlying highlighting decisions. With this data, a combination of selection criteria was proposed that was able to predict the probability of highlighting with a correlation of approximately 0.56, compared with an average correlation of 0.47 amongst the test subjects, and a figure of 0.30 for Word97's highlighting feature. The paper argues that the common factor behind the most successful hypotheses was that they are all signals denoting "new" as opposed to "given" information at the discourse level. Although based on a very limited sample, this observation seems clear enough to make detecting such signals a promising candidate for further research.

Optimal linear spline approximation of digitized models

1999
We present a new technique for surface reconstruction of digitized models in three dimensions. Concerning this problem, we are given a data set in three-dimensional space, represented as a set of points without connectivity information, and the goal is to find, for a fixed number of vertices, a set of approximating triangles which minimize the error measured by the displacement from the given points. Our method creates near-optimal linear spline approximations, using an iterative optimization scheme based on simulated annealing. The algorithm adopts the mesh to the data set and moves the triangles to enhance feature lines. At the end, we can use the approach to create a hierarchy of different resolutions for the model.

Visual metaphors to enhance hypermedia

The paper argues that whilst hypermedia systems potentially have a major role to play in education, there is the danger that they tend to engender cognitive and navigational overhead in their users, which in turn detracts from their educational value. A potentially valuable means of ameliorating this difficulty is to use metaphors to aid the user as they interact with the system. The value of metaphors in overcoming the problems of cognitive overloading and navigational overhead is discussed and an experimental study proposed to investigate the design and deployment of suitable metaphors in this context.

Visualisation of massive retrieved newsfeeds in interactive 3D

1999
This report describes work carried out under the Automatic Information Retrieval project at DERA, in building a 4D landscape (a TextScape) which acts as a graphical user interface (GUI) to the DERA-OKAPI search engine. Traditionally search engines present a 2D visual interface (usually a windows-icons-menus-pointer (WIMP) interface) to the user. Key words are entered and the 'hits' are displayed usually in a list form. Unfortunately, the number of documents retrieved is often overwhelming and a significant amount of time is still required to read abstracts and sections of documents in order to determine if they are relevant, even after the search engine has performed relevance ranking. The challenge is how to improve on this. We propose to render the information most immediately required onto the visual attributes of a 3D landscape. Shape, colour and size can then project the information that is sought, and mining the object hierarchy visually returns information more rapidly.

On shape to specifications adequacy

1999
Computer aided design now aims to provide designers with a support during the early stages of design. The purpose is to translate the client's specifications into a shape as automatically as possible. However, the processing of a text in natural language is still out of reach. We then assume that the client's specifications are manually translated into intermediate specifications composed of intermediate constraints upon physical parameters. Our efforts concern the transformation of these intermediate specifications into a shape, precisely the way to complete whether a shape satisfies the intermediate specifications or not. We first study the case in which the shape is a single primitive solid; we also give elements to choose the instance that best fits the specifications. Then, we study the extension of the method to solids defined by a combination of primitive solids.

Simulated Site Visits. A 4D multimedia database for the study of architectural construction
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
Architectural designs are translated into buildings using the documentation language. Gaps invariably exist between what is documented and what is built. Once a building is complete, its construction is largely concealed and it becomes difficult to compare the drawn details with the built details. This difficulty is compounded by the abstract nature of traditional architects' orthographic drawings. A multimedia relational database titled 'Simulated Site Visits' (SSV), developed by Clare Newton and Jonathan Finkelstein at the University of Melbourne, records the process of constructing buildings. The structure and layout of SSV facilitates comparisons across media and helps to shift the focus onto the connections and gaps between a building and its representation. The development of SSV has been funded because of its potential as a teaching aid for architecture and building students. This paper outlines teaching implications of this form of multimedia intertwined with a discussion of the research potential.

The paper appraises the role of virtual reality modelling language (VRML) based 3D computer based models of historic environments in increasing access for and assisting the understanding of the general public. It is argued that VRML based 3D models and linked media create a low cost easy to use and intuitively accessible interface through which transient or casual users can retrieve information or experience narrative. The same data collation and modelling process can also assist conservation professionals in their tasks. Criteria are discussed for determining when it is more appropriate to model rather than use photographic techniques in the light of the commonly expressed fear in conservation circles that vicarious presentations may dominate genuine historical experience. Developments are identified which may assist in improving ease of use and understanding by visitors on and off-site.

One of the main problems of the Web is its dominant textual characteristics. Since the natural way designers express their design ideas is in graphical form, accessing graphical information is a key issue. Since most of the design documents which are created today are products of CAD programs, our current research emphasis is upon indexing and retrieval of CAD documents on the Web. We present an approach for the utility and accessibility of CAD based design information. An approach for the use of CAD documents as a form of distributed case based design resource on the Web is proposed. Possibilities for employing case based CAD as a theoretical foundation for building large design resource bases on the Web are presented.

Moreover, the user's view level of a new graphical query language, namely GOQL (Graphical Object Query Language), for ODMG 2.0 is presented. The user's view level provides a graphical schema that does not contain any of the perplexing details of an object-oriented database schema, and it also provides a foundation for a graphical interface that can support ad-hoc queries for object-oriented database applications. We illustrate, using an example, the user's view level of GOQL.

The steady growth of the Internet has dramatically changed the way information is shared and modern users expect near real time delivery, high quality images together with in-depth navigation and exploration of 3D models. Multiresolution is a promising approach for fast distributed volume visualisation employing levels-of-detail. We review multiresolution algorithms and visualisation systems on the WWW. Our discussion is based on experience gained in the development of the IAEVA-II project funded by the European Commission. A new method for rapid data classification/rendering of multiresolution volumes based on shear-warp factorisation, is described. We can change classification functions and data resolution during rendering without significant reduction in interactivity. A method for constructing multiresolution transfer functions for determining opacity is also investigated. Finally, future trends in developing WWW visualisation systems are discussed.

UK Higher Education Institutions have invested significantly in the implementation of multimedia and visualization material in teaching, learning and assessment of civil and building engineering-with mixed results. The paper focuses on the use and life cycle of digital imagery and visualization material, which is embedded within multimedia teaching aids to improve student understanding. It describes ways in which these materials are developed and used in the civil and building engineering curriculum and, in particular, how distributed performance support systems can be applied to make more effective use of digital imagery and visualization material. Following this, the paper then describes how a distributed performance support system approach to education is being adopted at Loughborough University as part of the CAL-Visual project.

Modern visual technologies can resolve many of these problems by providing construction professionals with 3 dimensional information interfaces that allow them to use the visual model (3D, VR, etc.) as the medium for communication, interaction, and integration. The paper looks at trends and predictions within the construction sector for technologies such as visualisation through CAD and VR. It then presents an improved model for information interfacing through VR capabilities. The information interface model is a Web based one, developed to provide opportunities for many construction professionals across the supply chain using open technologies such as the Internet. The paper demonstrates that information visualisation is of importance and can be used by every participant within the construction sector including clients, contractors, cost estimators, project planners, and others. The paper concludes with a series of screen snap shots resulting from state of the art research on information visualisation and interfaces being conducted at the University of Salford (UK). Salford is bringing together visualisation, object oriented and Web technologies to solve the problems associated with construction information integration and communication. The paper provides an overview of this research which will help many interested parties understand how these technologies can work together.

Multimedia applications within the academic environment can be varied and include such things as: marketing of courses with an interactive prospectus; providing general administrative information (student handbooks, timetables, assignment schedules, module content, etc.); facilitating co-operative working using such things as computer conferencing or collaborative whiteboards; and for the purposes of computer assisted learning (CAL). In addition, multimedia can be used as an end in itself through students employing the embedded techniques in development of a spectrum of products. The main purpose of the paper is to explore the lessons that might be learnt through the application of information systems research to the field of multimedia education. By adopting this approach, parallels might be drawn between the two application areas to highlight the convergence of underlying philosophies and methods in order to inform good practice. The paper aims to promote discussion of the various aspects involved in multimedia systems development within an educational environment.

Mirroring Medusa: counterveillance in Shooting Back
1999 IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization
None
1999
In our society, apparati of electronic surveillance and satellite systems pervade almost every sector of our public and private lives. Information concerning individuals is controlled mostly by institutions, serving bureaucratic or corporate interest. The paper examines the possibilities of counter-surveillance in socio-cultural practices through Steve Mann's Shooting Back (S. Mann, 1997). In this 'meta-documentary', Mann dares to shoot back at the power of institutions and capital by recording the very devices of surveillance (e.g., surveillance cameras) with his tiny TV camera NetCam, which is hidden in his eyeglasses and connected to his wearable computer. This 'shooting' usually provokes quarrels with the clerks or the security guards. NetCam transmits the whole situation to share simultaneously with others who have access to his Web site. Through this skirmish with authority, we can examine the structure of omnipresent, 'capillary' power and grope for the possibilities for counterveillance via World-Wide Web.

Towards interactive finite element analysis of shell structures in virtual reality

1999
A first step towards a semi-immersive virtual reality (VR) interface for finite element analysis (FEA) is presented in this paper. During recent years, user interfaces of FEA solvers have matured from character-based command-line driven implementations into easy-to-use graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This new generation of GUIs provides access to intuitive and productive tools for the management and analysis of structural problems. Many pre- and post-processors have been implemented targeting the simplification of the man-machine interface in order to increase the ease of use and provide better visual analysis of FEA solver results. Nevertheless, none of these packages provides a real 3D-enabled interface. The main objective of this project is to join state-of-the-art visualization technology, VR devices, and FEA solvers into the integrated development environment VRFEA.

The paper introduces the efficient application of virtual reality (VR) technologies in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, where conventional plastic models are mainly used, which is called Physical Mock Up (PMU). An idea of virtual model (VM) is introduced. The VM consists of digital models added to by digital information about the project, such as CAD drawings, digital maps of periphery, scanned aerial photos, on-site digital pictures and documents. The paper investigates three principal points as follows: (1) whether presentation of the VM is as efficient as the PMU in terms of its power of expression; (2) whether digital information of the VM is useful to discuss views, ideas and interests about the construction project; (3) whether the VM is practical enough to use in the AEC industry. Pilot trials of the VM actual construction projects are illustrated: an on-going land readjustment project in Osaka and a large-scale soil borrowing project in Wakayama, Japan.

One of the virtues of our changing times is that new media has challenged us to rethink and reexamine our basic presumptions about reality and the reality that is virtually perceived. From the perspective of an electronic media artist, the author presents a body of work (case studies) of performative-like installations comprised of 3D structures integrating video imagery with the reality of the physical, psychological, virtual, and social worlds. These structures are instigators for enticing "social happenings" whereby participants and viewers become subjects from an observational perspective, providing a simulated clinical "case study". With the influence of theoretical and scientific information in the constructs of mediated environments, perceptions of risk, danger trust, and self-identity are challenged.

This paper presents methods for moving image sequence visualization and browsing based on algorithms from computer vision, information visualization and on a hierarchical model for content semantics. We introduce a new method, OM-Images, for the visualization of temporal changes in a moving image sequence. Together with interactive browsing techniques the visualization methods can be used for the exploration of a movie at different levels of abstraction. The proposed levels of abstraction are the physical, image, object or discourse level. The visualization is used to generate (1) static descriptions, which printed on paper yield a "movie book" and (2) interactive documents, e.g. Web pages or special movie browsers. Finally, we give examples of a movie book of a feature length film.

Due to its monolithic nature, 3D visualization software integrated with legacy engineering applications contain every possible feature you might use-whether or not a user really wants them. With the advent of distributed objects and interpreted platform-independent languages such as Java and VRML it is possible to develop cross-platform portable 3D visualization software as components that work in an easy-to-use manner. Adopting these advances, fast 3D visualization can considerably simplify the job of maintaining the life cycle of a road integrated within an agreed road product model. The paper aims to introduce new levels of support to engineers throughout the integrated product life cycle by dealing with issues such as fast platform-independent 3D visualization and product modelling using roads as an example.

Virtual reality technologies provide a unique method for enhancing user visualization of complex three-dimensional objects and environments. By experience and environmental interaction, users can more readily perceive the dimensional relationships of objects typically portrayed via static multiview or pictorial representations. Until recently, many of the VR technologies required significant computing power for adequate delivery and provided realism that is often less than actual. Alternatively video-based VR technologies overcome the two major limitations of true three-dimensional VR technologies-computing horsepower and realism. The focus of this contribution is to provide background information on VR technology for the improvement of spatial abilities, describe the advantages of video-based VR technologies, and provide examples showing how video-based VR can be used to enhance visualization in education and training.

Parametric modelling: concept and implementation

The implementation of parametric modelling in industrial and design enterprises has resulted in the ability of computer graphics users to reduce redundant labour practices by the creation of interactive databases. Designers and production staff now have the luxury of being able to edit these databases rather than always having to redesign models that are required to meet current needs or updated specifications. The regeneration of parametric models now allows reduced time in "art-to-part" production as well as providing a foundational database upon which future product development and revisions may rest. However, the large learning curves of most parametric modeling software packages more often than not make their introduction into manufacturing enterprises a slow and arduous experience. There are solutions to this ramp-up time that can allow manufacturers the ability to educate their computer users in the use of parametric modelling packages, and at the same time respond to the evolving needs of their enterprises.

A video-based approach for camera scene registration in augmented reality systems is presented. The presented technique relies on the definition of a model, which is derived from an appropriate parametric linear optimization problem. The optimal parameters are sought in the solution space defined by physically meaningful constraints. Solving the underlying regularized linear problem, we expect to overcome the major shortcoming observed in image-based augmented reality and telepresence systems: the extreme lack of robustness due to the ill-posed nature of the calibration problem. Several computer experiments have been conducted in order to assess the performance of the introduced technique.

A classification of multi-sensory metaphors for understanding abstract data in a virtual environment

2000
With the advent of virtual environment technology, it is now possible to construct new styles of user interfaces that provide multi-sensory interactions. For example, interfaces can be designed which utilise 3D visual spaces and also provide auditory and haptic feedback. Many information spaces are multivariate, large and abstract in nature. It has been a goal of virtual environments to "widen the human-to-computer bandwidth" and so assist in the interpretation of these spaces by providing models that map different attributes of data to different senses. While this approach has the potential to assist in understanding these large information spaces, what is unclear is how to choose the best metaphors or models to define these mappings between the abstract information and the human sensory channels. This paper takes a look at some issues involved in choosing such multi-sensory metaphors, provides a classification of interactions and examines their application to the task of technical analysis of stock market data.

Recording and retrieving spatial information with video and images

A pilot Web site study for comparative exploration of heritage landscapes and great European gardens has raised issues about the size and complexity of the datasets and the need to record locational and other metadata with visual and aural images. Such multimedia datasets deployed from spatial databases are likely to become served on demand with appropriate associated detail and data. Previous work on the Tower of London and its environs has shown that similar large complex datasets are increasingly common during the creation and management of 3D models of buildings and urban areas. Such datasets may also encompass digital video and high-resolution images, historical images and data, with maintenance and management information and record drawings. Little difference has been found in practice between the data management and retrieval issues that apply to Web-based multimedia interpretations of historic environments and those that are particular to large area 3D models. A common approach may serve an initial Web site based outcome and also assist later development of a virtual reality 3D model. The question of when it is useful to model and when video or high-resolution images may be equally or more useful is also examined.

The goal to produce effective optical character recognition (OCR) methods has led to the development of a number of algorithms. The purpose of these is to take the handwritten or printed text and to translate it into a corresponding digital form. The multitude requirements and developments are well represented in the literature (I.S.I. Abuhaiba et al., 1994: C.Y. Suen, 1986). The primary objective of the paper is to provide an insight into a robust system which has been successfully developed and employed to recognise Latin and Arabic characters and whose workings has been described previoulsy (J. Cowell and F. Hussain, 2000). The focus is to discuss the main components used in the multi-stage system, paying particular attention to the normalisation process used for orientation and size for a given bitmapped character. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through its workings for the Arabic and Latin case, both for characters and numbers.

The proliferation of content based image retrieval techniques has highlighted the need to understand the relationship between image clustering based on low-level image features and image clustering made by human users. In conventional image retrieval systems, images are typically characterized by a range of features such as color, texture, and shape. However, little is known to what extent these low-level features can be effectively combined with information visualization techniques such that users may explore images in a digital library according to visual similarities. The authors compare and analyze a number of Pathfinder networks of images generated based on such features. Salient structures of images are visualized according to features extracted from color, texture, and shape orientation. Implications for visualizing and constructing hypermedia systems are discussed.

Any negotiation involves consideration of several variables which act independently and collectively to determine the configuration of alternative outcomes. The numerical analysis of alternative options can be a tedious and lengthy exercise, thus inhibiting the negotiator from making informed decisions and indeed achieving the optimum benefit. Construction project financial management is an example where all related variables are up for negotiation between the main parities: the client, contractor and sub-contractors. This paper builds on the works previously introduced at IV conferences where the potential of the visual approach to the analysis of growth patterns was illustrated and the respective mathematical expressions were introduced. The paper collates these works into a conclusive visual method for instantaneous analysis of several variables that are influential in configuring construction project finance, thus preparing the contractor for informed negotiation with other parties.

A template-matching approach to free-form feature recognition
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
Feature recognition has been an active research area in the past two decades. While many techniques have been developed, most of them are limited to the detection of features that are of regular shapes. Examples include holes, slots, pockets and steps that are commonly used in engineering parts. This paper reports our investigation on a method that is able to detect free-form features. A template matching approach is used where the template represents the shape of the free-from feature to be detected. The feature recognition method works on a two-dimensional parametric space which represents all possible configurations of the template. A match between the template and the object from which the features are to be detected corresponds to a match-curve in the parametric space. Feature recognition is achieved by first searching the rough location of the match-curve followed by searching a precise location of a point on the match-curve. A program has been implemented to verify the feasibility of the approach, and examples are given to demonstrate the major steps in the method. The use of the method in computer graphics applications such as shape blending is demonstrated. The application of the technique in industrial applications such as injection mould design is also discussed.

This paper introduces two novel techniques to manipulate parallel coordinates. Both techniques are dynamic in nature as they encourage one to experiment and discover new information through interacting with a data set. The first technique, polyline averaging, makes it possible to dynamically summarise a set of polylines and can hence replace computationally much more demanding methods, such as hierarchical clustering. The other new technique interactively visualises correlation coefficients between polyline subsets, helping the user to discover new information in the data set. Both techniques are implemented in a Java-based parallel coordinate browser. In conclusion, examples of the use of these techniques in visual data mining are also explored.

Towards a 3D visualisation framework for construction planning with Procession
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
The construction industry traditionally uses two dimensional visualisation techniques to analyse project progress. This usually takes the form of an 's-curve', so called because of the characteristic plot shape (anecdotally generated by resource application take-up in many projects). Analysing project progress in this manner provides a 'single view' guide to data trends. The building blocks of projects are 'tasks'. Deeper interpretation of a project might require studying individual s-curves for each task. Indicative patterns can go unrecognised in this mass of unfiltered visual data. 'Procession' is an information visualisation software tool. It has been developed to provide a more comprehensive representation of project progress, utilising a three-dimensional data surface. In addition to offering a 'single view' navigable data-surface, Procession also intelligently filters and emphasises tasks, according to the significance of their deviant performance parameters.

A language-based framework for a form processor
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics

2000
Based on the analogy of architectural composition as a formal language, a form processor is developed and tested. The proposed processor addresses a universal language of architectural form. It aims to facilitate the manipulation of forms in a manner similar to that in which a word processor manipulates words in natural languages. Based on the ontological assumption of structuralism, epistemological assumption of rationality, and the methodological assumption of representation, the research described in this paper identifies the rudimentary elements underlying all architectural forms, and the steps needed to aggregate them into more complex compositions. The theoretical foundation of the form processor employs concepts of formal languages, the theory of reduction, and Aristotle's theory of animal shape variation. More specifically, this paper discusses a form language that is based on the concepts of context-free and attributed grammars.

Morphological definition of anatomic shapes using minimal datasets

2000
A new method for outlining tumour volumes and surrounding organs from computed tomography slices is presented. This task is performed during radiotherapy treatment planning and usually consists of the hand-drawing of a set of contours on the appropriate computed tomography slices of the patient lying in treatment position. This method is both time consuming and prone to errors. Our solution, based on three-dimensional scattered data interpolation, fits a three-dimensional primitive object on the contours, which are considered as 3-dimensional scattered points. The precision of this fit is iteratively refined by adding points to the interpolated contours. Interpolation using radial basis functions is combined with an appropriate mapping function between the primitive object and the scattered point cloud to provide this iterative warping. As a result, both a 3-dimensional mesh object and a set of contours are output. We describe the mapping function, as well as present some results obtained using this method.

2000
Describes an ongoing project with the goal of designing and implementing a method to evaluate visualizations based on the tasks supported. The method evaluates time to perform the task and the quality of the user solution. This method is described in detail in this paper. A software tool which uses visualization to support users performing environmental analysis was used to test the first version of this method. The software tool evaluated helps users to perform computations of the environmental impacts of two products. Two versions of the same software tool were used. The first version uses interactive tables and the second version displays the information using different types of interactive visualizations. The software tool was evaluated with users solving a task which consists of selecting a product from two alternatives based on environmental parameters. The users were divided into two groups. Each group of users solved the same task but they used different software tools. A summary of the findings and possible future research is presented at the end of this paper.

Ideograms in polyscopic modeling

None
2000
The paper argues that the task of representing interrelationships between things requires the use of visual techniques. Our common verbal factual approaches to information tend to miss something essential-the "perspective". In the paper the perspective is defined and explained with the help of a visual technique, the ideograms. It is shown that ideograms can be used for expressing and correcting the perspective. Methodologically, the paper is an introduction to ideograms as an information design technique. Eight applications of ideograms are discussed.

Co-cited author maps as interfaces to digital libraries: designing Pathfinder Networks in the humanities
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
Using data from the Arts and Humanities Citation Index for 1988-1997, we are attempting to generate co-cited author maps in real time that can serve as interfaces for document retrieval. Our novel approach is to start the maps by entering the name of a single author. Our system obtains a rank-ordered list of the other authors who are most often co-cited with the input name (e.g., the top 50) and then systematically pairs these other authors in turn to obtain their co-citation counts. The resulting matrix can be passed to a mapping program which groups the authors meaningfully to show the structure of the field implied by the input author's name. At present we are experimenting with Pathfinder Networks (PFNETs) as the mapping program, and show a PFNET for 25 authors in hermeneutics, a major field of the humanities. The documents co-citing the mapped authors are candidates for retrieval. We discuss desirable features and design considerations in retrieval interfaces based on PFNETs.

Visualization of routes in design process planning

2000
Design process planning is essential for business success. However, it is complex for all but the simplest products. There is therefore a need for effective support for the design process planner to help them visualize and assess alternative design process strategies. The paper describes a new approach to design process planning, known as signposting, which has the potential to assist in the characterization, and hence planning, of a particular design process, by identifying a number of possible design routes. The success of signposting is critically dependent upon the planner's ability to visualize the emergent process characteristics. A number of route visualization techniques are therefore presented and discussed. The preferred approach is then developed further in an attempt to maximize its visualization potential.

The transition from traditional graphics into computer graphics over the past decade has brought about a multitude of changes that graphics educators and other graphics professionals have had to address and incorporate. The ever evolving integration of computer aided design (CAD) in architecture and engineering have revolutionized the design and documentation process. In the graphic communication area, changes from layout and design to desktop publishing and interactive 'new media' design for CD-ROM and Web distribution are but a few of the changes graphic educators have to keep up with. One problem with new technology is computer graphics encompasses several components and areas, and some of these areas are not able to progress into technology as quickly as others. This paper gives an overview of the shades, shadows and perspective course at Purdue University and how it has evolved into an integrated 2D and 3D digital lighting and rendering illustration course.

World Wide Web visualisation systems are widely used for browsing or viewing search engine results. In the case of a local Web search tool, however, the browsing paradigm is combined with a searching paradigm, thus requiring dynamic visualisation methods. We describe an example of a visualisation system that is an extension of a common JavaScript script that is used as a Web site map. It is interfaced with a Java-based local search tool named VSEARCH. Our system provides an easy-to-integrate mechanism to implement information visualisation techniques like node colouring.

SinusCone /spl Theta//spl Phi/-a ThetaPhi algorithm for human arm animation

Arm animation algorithms are often categorized by their constraint expansion strategy. One option is the geometric bounding polygon-cone strategy, a simple containment search strategy that traverses the search space in the order in which successor bounding polygon edges are generated. An alternative is the ThetaPhi-cone strategy, which was designed to make it possible to use domain-specific heuristic information. By exploring promising parts of the cone space first, ThetaPhi-cone algorithms generally are more efficient than polygon-cone algorithms.

Multiresolution image morphing in wavelet domain
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
This paper presents a new view synthesis technique using the 2D discrete wavelet-based view morphing. View morphing is completely based on pairwise images without camera calibration and depth information of images. First, the fundamental matrix related to any pair of images is estimated. Then, with the fundamental matrix, the pair of image planes is rectified to be parallel and to have their corresponding points lie on the same scanline, which gives an opportunity to generate new views with linear interpolating techniques. The pre-warped images are then decomposed into a hierarchical structure with the wavelet transform. Corresponding coefficients between two decomposed images are therefore linearly interpolated to form the multiresolution representation of an intermediate view. Quantization techniques can be embedded here to compress the coefficients to reduce the morphing complexity. Finally, when displaying, compressed images are decoded and inverse wavelet transformed. A post-warping procedure is employed to transform the interpolated views to its desired position.

Haptic representation of the atom

Three-dimensional functions that represent atomic orbitals are traditionally difficult for chemistry students to conceptualize. Large sections of undergraduate physical chemistry texts are devoted to breaking apart and simplifying electron density functions so they can be visually represented. Traditional methodologies include skins (isosurfaces and enclosures of certain probabilities), three-dimensional projections (color, contours, slices) and two-dimensional graphs. Preliminary work with the Phantom 3D haptic interface suggests that haptics are an important addition to the chemist's tool set for representing atomic orbitals. With the Phantom, users simply move through real three-dimensional space and perceive the electron density as the force on the Phantom's pen. In our work, the force is proportional to the probability density function for the electron at any point, given by the square of the wavefunction describing a particular atomic orbital (/spl psi//sup 2/(r, /spl theta/, /spl phi/)). Nodes are felt as regions of zero force, increasing /spl psi//sup 2/ values are felt as increasing resistance, and maxima are communicated by haptic "clicks". Previous application of the Phantom to chemistry by Wanger (1998) utilized haptics for molecular docking feedback. The work tackles the altogether different problem of haptically visualizing the probability density functions of individual atomic orbitals. Feedback from chemistry students is positive and interest in continued development of the work is high among chemistry faculty.

This paper presents a project and considers the possibilities of using virtual reality in architectural design processes. The main goal of the project is to develop a process for collaborative design of laboratory layouts using VR (Cave-technology) as a tool integrated into the concepts of process architecture. The project has been carried out in co-operation with the Chemical Department at Lund Institute of Technology/Lund University. It is a "real" project integrated in the University's programming process. A workshop initiated the design process and was followed by a series of different design events, which were arranged with participants from one research and one education laboratory. At these events the participants made several visits to their future labs in a VR-Cave. The visits were alternated with more traditional design sessions using paper and pencil. The results show that the collaborative design process including VR helped users by providing a method with which their ideas could be better formulated, analyzed, tested, and finally realized. The results from the project have been incorporated into the building program for the new chemical laboratory building.

3D illustrative effects for animating line drawings

2000
Most illustrative techniques used in non-photorealistic rendering to date apply a rendering style to objects or a scene and alter the appearance of this style by employing illumination or depth cueing. However for generating high quality illustrations this approach relies almost entirely on smart placement of light sources. We introduce the concept of illustrative effects to describe the workings of illustrative techniques that rely on spatial location rather than just illumination or depth. Although the rendering style is still object-dependent, this technique allows us to visualize or emphasize parts of objects or the whole scene without being limited by the scene's object decomposition. The approach also enforces the decoupling of the model and its animation from the visualization task. We demonstrate our approach using a sample collection of illustrative effects applied to line drawings. A uniform set of tools to manipulate these effects is provided.

Extracting geometric models of muscles from the visible human data

Muscle simulation should be an important component of human modelling, but to date there have been few attempts to demonstrate muscle structures in an anatomically-correct way. This paper proposes a feature-based approach to muscle modelling which attempts to provide models for human musculature based on the real anatomical structures. These models provide a good visual description and form a sound basis for further developments towards medically-accurate simulation of human bodies. To allow for the wide variety of muscle shapes encountered in the body, the geometric models are based on muscle features identified from radiological data. These results are realistic models with correct anatomical structures.

Visualization in detection of intrusions and misuse in large scale networks

The Internet is quickly becoming entrenched in the communication and commercial sectors of everyday life. With this movement away from traditional fixed infrastructure we are also moving away from the traditional securities placed within fixed infrastructure. This has led to increasing numbers of attacks designed to infiltrate or disrupt the activities being performed by companies and individuals on the Internet. We are exploring the applicability of visualization techniques in conjunction with a well-known intrusion detection system (Hummer) for the detection and analysis of misuse of computer systems connected to the Internet. The visualization techniques will allow users to identify the behavior of users connecting to the system and identify those whose intentions are unwelcome.

Abstract data visualisation in the built environment

Research on data visualisation is undergoing major developments in a number of different fields. These developments include investigating ways of applying visualisation techniques and systems for the more efficient manipulation, interpretation and presentation of data. In the built environment field, the potential of new visualisation technologies to enhance the presentation of performance data obtained as output from simulation programs has remained almost unexplored. The primary aim of the work summarised in this paper was to commence the development of a method for visualising the data produced by thermal analysis tools. Two applications are presented. The first is designed to automatically process the output within a commercial spreadsheet program. The second is designed to display the solution in 3D to aid spatial recognition and data navigation. This paper shows, through small-scale user tests, that each of the proposed applications significantly improves some of the attributes associated with usability, namely: learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and user satisfaction. Advice is given on the key aspects that will require attention when the full method is developed. Finally, it should be possible to develop low-cost data visualisation tools to improve the overall usability of a thermal analysis tool within a built environment practice.

This paper presents a new approach for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) using virtual reality (VR) technology. In this paper, VR is used for sorting and visualising image databases in a 3D virtual environment and for representing the results of the search. After reviewing the state-of-the-art of colour image retrieval, the paper introduces the techniques of feature extraction, filtering, feature fusion, image browsing and navigation, and their implications for VR-based colour image retrieval. Although high level semantic processing is often necessary to produce useful navigation aids and search techniques, we apply low level colour, texture and shape features for our colour image discrimination associating content with other multimedia information such as image titles (text) due to effective implementation. Our feature fusion based on weighted multidimensional scaling (WMDS) has added to the existing techniques. Based on this experimental investigation using a colour-texture database, we have shown that virtual reality offers significant advantages as a tool for image retrieval.

The increasing parallelisation of development processes as well as the ongoing trends towards virtual product development and outsourcing of development activities strengthen the need for 3D co-operative design via communication networks. Regarding the field of CAx, none of the existing systems meets all the requirements of very complex process chain. This leads to a tremendous need for the integration of heterogeneous CAx systems. Therefore, MACAO, a platform-independent client for a distributed CAx component system, the so-called ANICA CAx object bus, is presented. The MACAO client is able to access objects and functions provided by different CAx servers distributed over a communication network. Thus, MACAO is a new solution for engineering design and visualisation in shared distributed virtual environments. This paper describes the underlying concepts, the actual prototype implementation, as well as possible application scenarios in the area of co-operative design and visualisation.

Axial representation for modelling 3D shapes

This paper presents a technique for representing animal models in terms of a set of axial curves. An object or an animal model is defined as the union of a set of different parts. Each part of the object is represented in an axial space defined by an axial curve-pair-a primary curve and an orientation curve. A hierarchy of axial curve-pairs defines the relative positions and orientations of different parts of the object. The shape of the object can be modified by adjusting the axial curve-pairs. Adjusting the axial curve-pairs according to some motion constraints produces different postures of an animal model. This technique is particularly suitable for modelling animals such as fishes and snakes.

Interactive art for Zen: "Unconscious Flow"

In face-to-face communications, the occasional need for intentional lies is something with which everyone can identify. For example, when we get mad, circumstances may force us to put on a big smile instead of expressing our anger; when we feel miserable, good manners may dictate that we greet others warmly. In short, to abide by social norms, we may consciously lie. On the other hand, if we consider the signs that our bodies express as communications (body language), we can say that the body does not lie even when the mind does. Considering this phenomenon, we propose a means of "touching the heart" in a somewhat Japanese way by measuring the heartbeat of the "honest" body and using other technologies to develop a new code of non-verbal communications from a hidden dimension in society. We call this "Meditation art" or "Zen art." "Zen" is Buddhist style meditation.

We describe a general methodology for reconstruction and animation of volumetric deformable objects. In the scope of a medical application, we want to simulate the motion and the form alteration of the internal anatomical organs. Multi-layer particle systems are well adapted to represent the geometry. However, several problems occur related to the structure of our model and the nature of internal forces. For this, we have introduced the necessary tools to overcome these problems and to handle the dynamic and deformable behavior of cancerous tissues and organs. Our particle system seems to be suitable to be integrated in radiation dose evaluation software, developed within the European BIOMED2-ARROW project by North Western Medical Physics team, in Manchester.

The iceberg metaphor to support the knowledge crystallization cycle

2000
Information visualization is focused on abstract non-numerical data. To support any user to explore this information the knowledge crystallization cycle was defined. We have developed the iceberg metaphor which can be used to support the user in every single step of this knowledge crystallization cycle. The iceberg can be filled with almost any kind of abstract information. Then the iceberg metaphor can be used to perform a classification as well as a filtering of the information. Using this metaphor for visualization is very simple but effective because the graphical presentation correspondents to the information-inherent structure. Additionally, with the developed iceberg browser all interactions concerning the knowledge crystallization are controllable. Thus, we have found a very simple but effective way to support the user in the formation of knowledge with one single metaphor.

How presentation graphs communicate

Graphs can show up simple qualitative patterns well, but not numbers or quantities. It is argued that to convey a message, a graph has to have an explicit storyline. To be remembered, that storyline has also to be verbalized. These two requirements are seldom discussed in the literature, let alone widely practiced. It is emphasized that a graph can convey a simple qualitative relationship supremely well: "it's a curve, not a straight line". But graphics seldom convey detailed quantities or numbers in a memorable way, if at all. It is also noted briefly how presenters' familiarity with their own material often makes them grossly overestimate what anyone new to it (i.e. the typical audience) can get out of their charts.

SequenceWorld: a genetics database in virtual reality

Proper information visualization has always been viewed as an important tool for research. Traditionally, however, it was regarded as only a tool, with information content and visualization being analogous to an object and its representation, respectively. These days, visualization is increasingly seen as an integral part of information content, without which data collections may lose significant value. This paper is devoted to applying a new visualization scheme-SequenceWorld-to a genetics database. We view a collection of genetic sequences as a browsable virtual world. Sequences cluster according to their homologies. Their relative position, colour and shape codings offer a direct visual perception of a significant amount of information, which would otherwise be available only via extensive analysis of numerical and textual data. We discuss the usability of SequenceWorld for completing traditional and novel genetic database search tasks, particularly since a holistic view of a complete genome has recently become possible.

This paper describes the use of virtual environments in endodontics. The problems associated with capturing the virtual environment by defining and manipulating the geometric shapes of teeth are illustrated. Dentists require ways of interacting with the virtual environment which closely mirror the conditions under which they work. Touch is very important when working in the close confines of the mouth and using instruments within dental cavities. Therefore, the paper reports on experimentation with novel interactive techniques designed to work with the available geometric representations of teeth. These techniques involve combining surface descriptions with force feedback and collision detection, to give the dentist realistic sensations in simulating treatment procedures. Some early experiments with distributed environments are described, with potential for collaboration in mentored training.

A rational spline for visualizing positive data
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
A piecewise rational cubic spline has been introduced to visualize the positive data in its natural form. The article explains how it is attempted that the spline method preserves the shape of the data when it is positive. The spline representation is interpolatory and applicable to the scalar valued data. The shape parameters in the description of the rational cubic have been constrained in such a way that they control the shape of the curve to avoid any noise. As far as visual smoothness is concerned, the curve scheme under discussion is C/sup 1/.

2000
Traditional searching and browsing functions for bibliographic databases no longer enable researchers to deal efficiently with the rapidly growing number of scientific publications. Our project BibRelEx aggregates expert knowledge on a body of scientific literature and makes it available to researchers who wish to explore the literature. We take a two-pronged approach. First, we collect expert annotations on publications and their semantic relationships to other publications. Second, we let researchers explore this semantically enriched body of literature and knowledge through visualizations. Hence, we enable researchers to track relevant documents based on their colleagues' expertise. We are testing our approach with a bibliographic database in a computational geometry.

2000
This paper presents a strategy for automatically mapping information onto visual parameters in the field of three-dimensional (3D) information visualization. The work presented is done in the context of researching how 3D information visualization may help when trying to visualize large volumes of dynamic data. The application field within which this work has been conducted is using 3D information visualization for network monitoring and management. Nonetheless, the framework and mapping strategy is application domain independent. We focus on the process of automatically mapping data values onto graphical parameters, in order to construct 3D virtual worlds that convey network data for network monitoring and management. We present the criteria that are used to find the best mapping and the strategy taken to implement those criteria. We describe our use of visual metaphors and the graphical components that we utilize and we give some examples of different mappings.

Hexagonal raster for computer graphics
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
Presents a new approach to representing a pixel in raster graphics. New technologies make this new approach possible. The author discusses issues concerning the optical resolution of the human eye. Some technical solutions are proposed, which are currently being worked out and which can radically change the approach to raster graphics. In the simulator creation process and in virtual reality, the quality of a picture is of great importance. Hitherto prevailing solutions have many disadvantages. The solution suggested in this paper is based on the so-called H-pixels. Traditional pixels in raster-graphic solutions are put into grid-plate knots. The suggested solution is based on a grid with regular hexagons as the main element. The paper includes an analysis of how such a shape can help in the reproduction fidelity of a set of shapes. Traditional algorithms for quadric pixels have also been prepared and checked. The presented approach to raster graphics can be used in systems where a picture is created, in a similar way to typography, from a very good raster, but in three (RGB) or four (CMYK) colours. Accepting the usefulness of H-pixels results in a re-analysis of all picture-creating algorithms, e.g. drawing segments, circles, etc. Algorithms such as raster picture compression or algorithms based on quadtrees (covering invisible lines) will also need adaptation. Currently, it is difficult to state to what extent this solution will be applied in the future, but it is so likely and interesting that, in the author's opinion, it seems worth working on.

2000
The Web is a popular platform for training educators and learners in educational systems. We find several Web based training systems that are developed by enterprises that try to train teachers and students to use Web technologies in educational settings. The rapid growth of the Internet and computer technology in recent years has sparked a demand for easily accessible and affordable learning solutions in corporate offices, classrooms, and homes. Traditional learning models are being challenged by the fast paced, real time environments available today. The purpose of the paper is to apply systems design principles to the design of Web based training systems for teachers and learners. Several issues are addressed, such as the development of an Integrated Learning Graphics System (ILGS) for a better learning environment. We develop a Web based learning system of computer graphics by Bezier, B-spline and NURBS algorithms. The purpose of the research was to increase the effect of computer aided design (CAD) in network. The other advantages are that a network browser is the common platform in Internet and intranet, the graphics system can be portable cross different operating system such as Windows 95, Linux, etc. In fact, the graphics system was an attempt at resource sharing.

2000
The view that visual reasoning in design is facilitated by external visualisation, specifically sketching, is based on both anecdotal evidence and empirical observations. The purpose of the current research is to investigate the relationship between visual reasoning, via sketches and the development of the early conceptual stages of the design process. Thus, the paper focuses on an analysis of visualising in conceptual design problem solving. The application of a new taxonomy throws light on experts' use of external visualisations. The results indicate that there are 'shifts in focus' with regards to the functional use of visualisations in architectural conceptual design.

A system is presented to visualize information about a city with a three-dimensional Web user interface. We present a novel way to connect a VRML world to an information database. As the data, code and models are kept separate, updates and maintenance of the system is easy. The information visualization of a city becomes easier and more intuitive in 3D. The location of any service, shop etc. is shown both in a 3D world and on a 2D map, which are interconnected. Our implementation works on standard Web browsers. In addition, we built an optional steering wheel navigation, which is an intuitive way of moving around in a city for home Internet users. An experimental immersive VR interface was also made.

Improved extraction of planar segments for scanned surfaces
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
The reverse engineering of a physical object often requires the production of a digital representation of the object. The object surface is scanned and a large number of points are obtained. These points are often organised in some way which provides adjacency information. However, in other cases, the result is an unstructured set of points, or point cloud. From such a point cloud a triangulated surface can be generated, so in all cases adjacency information can be obtained. Copies of the original object can be manufactured using the triangulated surface to define the shape. Often the original object is made up of parts of a number of simple geometric primitives and could be represented much more simply. Our aim is to segment a discretely represented surface into a small number of such simple geometric components using a 'region growing' approach. This paper describes an improved algorithm (with 'super triangles') for planar extraction, which requires only the data points and some form of adjacency information.

Creating abstract digital paintings with painting camera technique
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
We present a simple and intuitive rendering technique to create abstract paintings. This technique allows the users to render a given animated scene with multiple cameras, using a method inspired by concepts used by cubist and futurist abstract painters. In our method, the number of cameras is unlimited and the camera parameters are continuous functions. We define the camera parameters as parametric functions that are described by images, which we call camera-control-images. The spatial distribution color in these camera-control-images determines the camera parameters such as position and orientation. For the creation of abstract paintings, we have developed two artistic techniques. In the first technique, artists incrementally paint a complicated camera-control-image for a given 3D scene. The second technique is the opposite of the first. In this technique, for a given camera-control-image artists incrementally built a 3D scene to create an interesting abstract painting. The second technique is helpful when using existing images such as photographs and paintings.

Computer-based animation of a multi-legged articulated body

2000
A methodology for modelling quadruped gaits and gait transitions based on Fourier series analysis of horse movement is proposed. The resultant model is used to create animated locomotion sequences of a quadruped changing gait. The dynamic similarity hypothesis is used as a method for comparing the gaits of different animals. The fields investigated to provide the background of this work are animation, gait research, data gathering and simulation. From these the methodology has been used to define a generic rotoscoped model for movement, which although developed from horse movement data, could be equally applied to any other quadruped. Keys ideas from biomechanics and gait research have been incorporated into the gait and gait transition models. Different gaits have fundamentally different leg movement patterns, so a locomotion model which models different gaits must take into account the synchronisation between the legs during locomotion. Additionally any methodology used to simulate the transition between gaits must take into account the phase differences between the legs when simulation a gait transition. Animation provides techniques to model the visual motion of a multi-legged figure moving using a number of different gaits, the control of movement is determined by the gait model.

This paper examines contemporary developments in 3D immersive art and experience as it is applied to information and spatial design. Attention is paid to historic forbears, particularly the ancient Greek art of memory, contemporary theorists, and current new media artists who are pushing code and application design to new limits. The role of the artist as "coder" and application engineer is specifically addressed. This paper anticipates specific concerns and possible technological developments in visualization and virtual spaces. As New Media Artists code; current boundaries between disciplines and sectors become blurred and new aesthetic judgments become pivotal. Additionally, current management and organizational structures are challenged to confront a world that increasingly visualizes and communicates in 3D.

Synthesis of hair images is one of the most important and challenging computer graphics problems. We propose a new technique for automatically generating realistic human hair texture on 3D models of human characters. The idea is inspired by the similarity between the texture of human hair and the texture generated by the LIC algorithm. The proposed technique generates the texture of human hair using the vector field defining the directions of hair strands as the input to the 3D LIC algorithm.

Data optimisation for visualisation of FEM-data

2000
The amount of data produced by a finite element calculation places a particular challenge to scientific visualisation, specifically in the field of tunnelling, because to describe the very complicated properties of the rock-mass with a finite element mesh, this mesh must have a very fine grid. This effects a large number of elements and for each of them simulation results are calculated. If the tunnel advance is simulated a large number of loadsteps are calculated, which also increases the amount of data, so result files can reach a size of hundreds of megabytes. Because of decreasing hardware costs the storage of these data is no longer a real problem, but for the visualisation in real-time techniques are necessary to reduce this amount of data without loosing any information. In this paper methods are presented to extract the parts of the FEM-output-data that are necessary for the visualisation of the simulation results. There are two major parts which have to be considered: the geometry and the simulation data. In both the requirements for simulation and visualisation are different. The techniques described fulfil the requirements of scientific information visualisation.

Multi-user VR systems are mostly aimed at social interaction, whereas exploitation of shared virtual environments for educational purposes has been largely ignored. We introduce the notion of tutor-based systems and consider the main differences between a tutor-based multi-user system and a social interaction system. In the proposed approach, one of the users is the tutor while the others represent auditors. This paper focuses on possible means for expressing a tutor's role including special auditor's operating modes supported by the mechanism of net-routes. Theoretical considerations have been tested on the DILEWA experimental system.

I was engaged to develop information resources for network business and about five years ago the Internet spread globally. My research on human communication via the Internet uncovered several domestic problems in Japan. This paper tries to address some of the experiences on communication via the Internet within Japanese culture. Using case studies, this research paper points out important guidelines for digital drawing. The author examines various computer-generated products based on cross-cultural interactions. The data used in this research was compiled from surveys of approximately 1,000 subjects and considered about 7 digital products. We believe that the emerging field of digital art has much to gain from improved cross-cultural communications, eventually giving rise to art works comparable to those created by Van Gogh, Picasso, or Magritte.

Automatic 2-D gel registration using distance minimisation of image morphing
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
The necessity of applying image processing techniques to gel electrophoresis images is starting to appear. In particular, registering two gels for comparison purposes has emerged from the increasing popularity of gel databases distributed across the Internet. Current registration techniques are however cumbersome in the sense that they require user intervention for placing landmarks on both gels in order to define a mapping function. Current techniques also cannot account for distortions which are common to 2-D gels and non-reproducible by nature. Thus, the only method of choice is to make a side-by-side comparison of the gels. We propose an automatic registration method especially designed with electrophoresis gels in mind to give an optimal registration while still allowing human input. We think that an automated registration of 2-D gels, because of its non-intrusive nature, will lead to a wider acceptance of image vision technology in electrophoresis gel software. Potentially, other types of biomedical images could benefit from the technique.

Structuring the visual content of digital libraries using CBIR systems

2000
We describe the benefits of CBIR (content-based image retrieval) systems for retrieval and organization of visual content in databases of digital libraries. Unlike text-based retrieval systems which work with manually annotated keywords as metadata, CBIR systems use automatically extracted numerical representations of perceptual features such as color, texture or shape. This technique enables users of digital libraries to retrieve visual content without the help of textual metadata, which in some cases may be either nonexistent or not sufficient for a special purpose. It is our approach to support maintainers of digital libraries in organizing large image volumes using CBIR systems. Finding clusters of similar content or providing clusters with suitable keywords are new application contexts of CBIR. We propose a method for structuring visual content and evaluate retrieval results of CBIR systems with regard to their applicability to this method.

Staff at the University of the West of England (UWE) have been engaged with other agencies in a collaborative process to create a millennial Web site for the citizens and city of Wells. The development of this site on the WWW is a part of a wider investigation which is both an attempt to understand the effective design of Web-based records of localities in terms of content and structure, as well as to set up a method for recording historic sites. The initial goals are to: record the built environment at the turn of the millenium; integrate this with existing records and archives; create a vehicle for the general public to contribute to records; and assist all sections of the community in gaining a richer understanding of their heritage. This paper examines the expectations of the agencies involved, the manner in which these have been implemented on the Web using multimedia, and the feedback and response to date, which has in turn modified the focus of the project.

Desktop virtual reality (VR) offers a powerful environment for visualizing structure in large information sets. In well-designed virtual worlds, users can employ skills from wayfinding in the real world. The paper reports on the development and testing of a series of prototype VR worlds, designed to support navigation during information visualization and retrieval. Results indicated that users subjectively preferred naturalistic environments over abstract ones, but that users objectively searched better in environments that had rigorous hierarchical structure, and support for both overview and detail. In comparison with a hypertext interface, the final virtual world design elicited more enjoyment, without worsening search performance significantly, when appropriate training time was allowed. This prototype shows the potential value of navigable VR that is engaging and useful for everyday information exploration.

Navigation-dependent visualization of distributed Internet structures
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics

2000
One of the main aspects of the Internet is that it is a distributed, multimedia database offering a fast growing amount of valuable information. Searching this database can be done by posing questions to search machines like Alta Vista. On the other hand, it is possible to browse through the space of connected information objects. When browsing, the problem arises that the user usually has no special knowledge of the structure of the visited hypertext area he is looking at. It may happen that he loses orientation and gets 'lost in hyperspace'. This article presents a software architecture that provides a visitor to a limited, distributed Internet area with additional structure information depending on his individual navigation path. Knowledge about the local hypermedia area is made available by a server program and is passed on to a visualization tool working in a frame of the client's Internet browser. This tool is loaded automatically from the server as a Java applet. By communication with the server, the visualization tool remains active throughout the navigation process and can be updated automatically.

BizViz (Business Visualization) is a rapidly growing phenomenon in the realm of visualization and information visualization. The main goal of BizViz is to support managers in their daily work of understanding forces within business processes and making decisions to control these forces. The case study presented in this paper illustrates the added value of visualization at a social security institution (Gak) in the Netherlands. The prototype built, integrates both databases and simulation as information sources. This way managers can study the past and present as well as experiment with possible future situations. The intended contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents how visualization can (successfully) be applied in practice. It illustrates the added value of BizViz in the social security domain. As a second contribution, the paper derives and discusses requirements that play an important role in visualization application development intended for decision-making support.

Optimal hierarchical adaptive mesh construction using FCO sampling

2000
This paper introduces an optimal hierarchical adaptive mesh construction algorithm using the face-centered orthorhombic lattice (FCO) sampling which is a natural extension of the quincunx lattice to the 3-dimensional case. A scheme for construction of adaptive meshes is presented. Initially, a highly detailed and densely sampled regular mesh is obtained from geometry scanning or from a nonoptimal polygon mesh. The adaptive triangle mesh is constructed by using fixed position vertices along with an efficient adaptive triangulation technique. The decimation is based on FCO sampling and surface estimation filters. The result is a progressive sequence of meshes consisting of more triangles wherever sharp edges exist and fewer in uniform plane regions. Experimental results demonstrate the usage and performance of the algorithm.

Water dome-an augmented environment
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the influence that a water dome has on a person. The following approach was used for this study: (1) a water display was used as a projection screen; (2) the illusion of being under water was created; and (3) experiments with water domes of various sizes were carried out. The water display is a head mounted type water membrane. When the display is projected, the internal surface acts as a concave mirror that can reflect the hand and face of a participant. The water dome is a hemisphere 8 m in diameter. Participants were allowed to see the real world through a transparent wall of water on which computer-generated images were projected. A water dome has the advantage of engaging a participant's five senses as it enhances the surrounding environment. We developed a water dome that incorporates the points of view of both the artist and the engineer.

Performance measures for training spatial knowledge in virtual environments using Division Inc. and VEGA Marine geometric models
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
Spatial knowledge, often used in military operations, is a significant component of military skills. It includes knowledge of the relationships of one object to others, the movement of objects relative to others, and the relationship of the human to each of the objects, and this involves perception and awareness of the human's position within the situation. Key ingredients include both time and distance perceptions by the humans. Recently, the military have been exploring the use of virtual environment technology; the focus for training systems has been on simulation of the environment and on the behavior of the objects from a mathematical modeling perspective. This paper examines two of the major factors involved in performance metrics for use within virtual environments. The focus of this research is on the performance measurement of the training environment using US Naval case studies implementing geometric modeling.

A study on the ray-tracing acceleration technique based on the ZF-buffer algorithm
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
In this work, we propose the ZF-buffer algorithm in order to accelerate the intersection test of ray tracing. The ZF-buffer is used in the preprocessing of ray tracing and records the pointer that points to a parent face of a depth value (z value) of an object determined in the Z-buffer. As a result, the face that intersects with the first ray can be determined easily by using the pointer stored in the F-buffer. Though the ZF-buffer and vista-buffer resemble each other, the difference between the two methods is that what ZF-buffer records is not bounding volume but the pointer of a displayable face. We applied the ZF-buffer algorithm for the first ray to the Utah teapot that consists of 9216 polygons. By comparing the elapse time of our method with the vista-buffer algorithm we can acquire improvement in speed that it is three times faster than the vista-buffer algorithm. We also try to apply our method to reflective objects.

Content-based retrieval of 3D models in distributed Web databases by visual shape information
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics

2000
Digital documents assembled from different components, like text, images, video, audio and 3D models, are supported today by many distributed applications. This paper presents a new approach to retrieving 3D models as part of digital documents using content-based image retrieval functionality. To find a 3D model best-fitting the user's query, shape information is extracted from the retrieved models and a score is generated by comparing shape images with the graphical user input. A distributed database environment with a WWW interface is presented and used as a generic implementation platform for this technique. The new retrieval method for 3D geometry is then described by extending the generic architecture in two steps, with a server-side module and an interactive client display. I outline how this method can be used for partial geometry downloading of 3D models in digital libraries.

To perform 3D editing in a cooperative environment presents problems that do not exist in other environments. Maintaining the consistency among all the replicated instances of the scene being edited is the key problem. The authors present the mechanisms to solve these problems such as collaborative operations on multiple scenes, cooperative copy and paste operations, and the ability of reversing actions (undo) in a cooperative editing environment. A brief introduction to a cooperative 3D editing and visualisation tool is presented. The protocol to ensure its memory consistency is discussed. The data structures, as well as the techniques used to manipulate the data to realise the mechanisms are described.

Intelligent digitisation of Arabic characters

2000
There are a number of initiatives aimed at the introduction of the digital age to the Arab world. A leading company in this area is Sakhr Software, who have just launched their programme (SakhrMedia) to support the learning process in local educational institutions. The objective is to meet the greater requirement of computerising both the techniques and the knowledge which has thus far been developed alongside traditional platforms. In this regard efforts have been made to computerise Arabic typography and language (often referred to as Arabisation). This is vitally important not just to meet everyday needs, but also to harmonise for the Arab audience interaction with worldwide accepted application packages, as well as the Internet. The purpose of this paper is to revisit the digitising process (sometimes called rasterisation) of the most valued aspects of a language, its character set. Using a geometric modelling approach, a computer system has been developed to extract and store features of Arabic fonts. Such a process lends itself to fast reconstruction and rendering of characters, and for text recognition techniques. The discussion provides an insight into the workings of the system, with view to assisting the digitisation process for Arabic.

Domain visualization aims to reveal the most significant intellectual structure associated with a subject domain. This article illustrates how domain visualization enables novel ways of accessing scientific literature in digital libraries. The domain of computer graphics is visualized based on a citation analysis of articles appeared in the prestigious IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications over 18 years (1982-1999). The derived the high-dimensional domain structure is uncovered through the use of various visualization and animation techniques. Author co-citation maps open up new ways of visual information retrieval. Not only can users explore domain visualizations as a virtual landscape, but also invoke queries directly to a digital library. In this article, the domain visualization is linked to various citation-related information of scientific literature on the Web through NEC's ResearchIndex system.

Describes a new approach to visualising the contents of human consciousness that combines the Twin VR (virtual reality) technology with relevant psychological methods. The Twin VR technology is based on the use of two dynamically connected virtual environments: the first one serves for the elicitation of required information and the second for its visualisation. A prototype VRGrid system is presented as a practical implementation of this approach. The system allows eliciting and visualising some personal conceptual models in the context of personal construct psychology (PCP). Several aspects of the development of the prototype using emerging technologies such as Java 3D and X3D (Extensible 3D) are discussed.

Direct annotation: a drag-and-drop strategy for labeling photos

2000
Annotating photographs is such a time-consuming, tedious and error-prone data entry task that it discourages most owners of personal photo libraries. By allowing the user to drag labels, such as personal names, from a scrolling list and drop them onto a photo, we believe we can make the task faster, easier and more appealing. Since the names are entered in a database, searching for all photos of a friend or family member is dramatically simplified. We describe the user interface design and the database schema to support direct annotation, as implemented in our PhotoFinder prototype.

The paper discusses the use of XML as an intermediate format for storage of information on microscope images and the different techniques to visualize this information. In this manner we have explored XML and built several applications for image management. The XML-files generated by these applications are defined as the lab-notebook. A crucial feature of such a lab-notebook stored in XML is that it directly relates to the Internet so that a modern Web browser can be used to present the data in a user-friendly manner. We discuss how we used XSL and Java applets to accomplish this.

Co-planar shape-fitting using the Rotating Squares algorithm
2000 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics
None
2000
Rotating Squares is a method based upon the Marching Cubes algorithm of Lorensen and Cline (1987). It is used as a method for storing a piecewise linear approximation of a two dimensional object (Donafee, 2000). Approximations to two distinct shapes can then be easily compared to find common boundary segments. However, it is also possible to use the algorithm to determine how to align the two shapes in a plane, such that they have the longest possible boundary segment in common. It is this issue that is addressed in the paper. Examples are given in which, while finding alike boundary segments, the Rotating Squares algorithm does not provide an edge along which the two shapes can be aligned without intruding upon one another. We present a simple test that can be used to indicate any space-sharing violation. Since the motivation for this work arose in three dimensions we go on to give considerations necessary for lifting the algorithms to three dimensions.

2D and 3D visualization technologies developed for the Web are taking the world by storm. Companies now see the Internet/intranet and the Web as key mechanisms for distributing information internally and among their customers. With the evolution of standard Web-based visualization components, the opportunity to provide interactive electronic documents has become practicable. The author of a scientific, engineering or business analysis, can distribute electronic documents with embedded interactive 3D visualization viewers to colleagues. This paper shows how to deliver interactive visual data navigation in an electronic document through the Web based on Microsoft's ActiveX/COM industry standard.

Cyberspace not only facilitates the use of the whole range of multimedia but it also provides for an unlimited recombination of images, text, sound, animation and video for a huge variety of applications. For example, cyberspace facilitates the creation and visualisation of new virtual spaces as well as virtual identities. As such, a huge number of ethical issues are raised. Some of these issues include those of privacy, accuracy, data security, intellectual property rights and accessibility. However, concern for these issues and the actual social and cultural impact on society of the burgeoning development of a multimedia cyberspace is very often overlooked in most of the 'hype' and 'techno-enthusiasm' that abounds. This paper therefore addresses some of the ethical issues that computing professionals owe a duty to society to consider and expose.

Information visualization can improve the access and manipulation of digital data if it conforms to human expectations, and supports the particular interface, task, data, and user. Detailed usability studies are required to prove this assumption. The paper reports a usability study of the data analysis algorithm applied in the LVis, Digital Library Visualizer that spatially visualizes search results derived from user queries of digital library collections. In particular, it presents a comparison of free sorting results for image data done by 20 human subjects and the data analysis result derived via Latent Semantic Analysis from the textual image descriptions. The results of the study suggest that people, if asked to categorize with no constraints, will use features that are often derivable from textual metadata. Human clustering strategies and resulting demands for image browsing systems are discussed and future work is outlined.

This paper describes a browsing system for a database using visualization of user preferences. The system has the following features: the use of 3D thumbnail objects to represent their contents and properties; the use of some property views and multidimensional scaling (MDS) to lay out the objects in information space; and the use of an update mechanism to perform the adaptive visualization to changes in user preferences. In this environment, the user becomes aware that there are information sets which the user seems to be interested in, from objects in the information space, and stroll there.

Visual communication for the masses

2000
Visual communication is vitally important to a variety of disciplines. Generally, information is communicated in a way that is deemed appropriate for the discipline, governed by established rules based on prior research. However when communicating to general audiences en masse, it is imperative that information be presented as simply as possible-the rules governing specialized scientific communication may or may not be applicable. In short, accessing information should be straightforward, allowing the users to efficiently gain the knowledge for which they are searching. The visual content that is presented should be clear, concise and accurate. With this in mind, this paper discusses issues related to delivering spatially-oriented data to the general populace. Communication through computer graphics should be for the masses as much as it is for individual disciplines. As such, the first half of this paper examines issues related to visual communication for the mass population, while the later half examines one such resource being used for visualization and communication at Purdue University.

The problem of trying to view and comprehend large amounts of data is a well-known one. A specialised version of this problem, that of visualising program code (often known as software visualisation) has suffered from the field refusing to embrace new ideas and technologies. The paper presents an application of virtual reality to this problem and highlights areas of importance from virtual reality that have been used to good effect when creating graphical abstractions of Java source code. A summary of the achievements of this approach and the relationship to the virtual reality features believed to be most beneficial is provided.

Visualisation of long distance grammatical collocation patterns in language
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Research in generic unsupervised learning of language structure applied to the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and decipherment of unknown languages has sought to build up a generic picture of lexical and structural patterns, characteristic of natural language. As part of this toolkit, a generic system is required to facilitate the analysis of behavioural trends amongst selected pairs of terminals and non-terminals alike, regardless of which target natural language was selected. Such a tool may be useful in other areas, such as lexico-grammatical analysis or tagging of corpora. Data-oriented approaches to corpus annotation use statistical n-grams and/or constraint-based models; n-grams or constraints with wider windows can improve error rates by examining the topology of the annotation-combination space. We present a visualisation tool to help linguists find "useful" PoS-tag combinations, and cohesion between linguistic annotations at other levels, and suggest some possible applications.

VAST displays a pair of student submissions and a graphical representation of their similarity, allowing tutors to navigate directly to areas of potential plagiarism. It improves on the human-eye approach by identifying similarities which a tutor might otherwise miss, thus saving investigative time. VAST is demonstrated using noise-free synthetic texts and actual student submissions containing intra-corpal plagiarism. Associated ideas, including similarity visualisations, similarity intersections and the "four-stage plagiarism detection process" are also introduced.

Modeling and inheritance of behaviour in object-oriented systems
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
One of the main benefits of object orientation is the concept of inheritance which allows for the derivation of new types/classes from existing ones. Within commonly used object oriented languages, inheritance is usually directed to attributes and method signatures, only. Considering languages providing means for the specification of object life cycles, the concept of inheritance needs to be extended to be able to cover not only static but also behavioural aspects. The article introduces a set of requirements for the modeling and inheritance of object behaviour. Based on a short survey of existing work, a new approach is introduced which is suited to be used with a class of object oriented Petri nets.

A multiple-focus graph browsing technique using heat models and force-directed layout
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Describes a multiple-focus graph visualization and navigation technique using two heat models: a heat conduction model and a thermal radiation model. The proposed technique integrates force-directed layout techniques with the heat models. It provides virtual heat energy to focus nodes or a focus region. The heat influences the temperatures of link and other nodes, and then the temperatures determine the attributes, such as the sizes and lengths, of the nodes and links. A prototype browser using the proposed technique has been implemented with the Java programming language and the Java3D class library. The browser can visualize a general graph structure interactively in a 2D or 3D view. It allows us to have both multiple positive foci and negative foci, and enables us to navigate in a graph by using a heat-radiating pointer.

Visual interaction with XML metadata
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
This paper explores the possibility of developing interactive visually-rich interfaces that enable Web users to access and manipulate XML metadata and underlying ontologies. Native visualisations, i.e. those that are integral parts of the process of creating and displaying XML documents, are analysed in order to utilise their potential in our interface design. As a result of adapting and merging various native visualisations, a novel and efficient representation of the XML document ontology has been developed-the Generalised Document Object Model Tree (G-DOM-Tree) Interface. This interface represents XML metadata and their structure in a comprehensive, intelligible and compact way that is suitable for the Web-based manipulation of its elements. After reviewing the main existing technologies for implementing the G-DOM-Tree Interface, a working prototype of an XML Ontology Translator is presented. This application generates dynamically ontological models of two XML documents in the G-DOM-Tree form and then allows Web users to map them in order to establish XSLT-based communications between XML dialects that are syntactically dissimilar but describe the same domain. The paper shows that visual interaction with XML ontologies can provide a simple but effective way of dealing with the problem of semantic interoperability of XML documents within real-life Web-based applications.

Visualizing the impact of the cache on program execution
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
The global cache misses ratio of a program does not reveal the time distribution of the memory reference patterns in detail. On the other hand, cache visualization is hampered by the huge amount of memory references to display. Therefore, many visualizers focus on a snapshot of the cache content, instead of viewing all memory transactions. A cache visualizer is introduced which presents the integral cache behavior of a program in several complementary views: the density view of the cache misses shows the hot spots of the program; the reuse distances view shows the data locality and its effect on performance; the histogram view shows the periodical patterns that occurs in the trace. In a number of experiments, the visualizer has been used to characterize the cache behavior and effectively improve the cache behavior and program performance.

Quantitative image analysis of optical sensor surfaces for movement monitoring
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
The use in clinical situations of a near real-time prototype opto-electronic dynamic 3D surface sensor has been investigated. Variations within optical sensor system height-maps show that noise amounts to 100 microns on snapshots of smooth body surfaces. It is not increased by image processing software removing triangulation spot artefacts. Presence of hairs on a body surface degrades the image quality, but still within tolerance (800 microns, typically the size of in-slice CT pixel). The accuracy of the system is 150 microns, the repeatibility 300 microns; 'off-surface' points should however be masked. Feasibility of dynamic 3D imaging of a body surface is demonstrated. Visualisation and analysis of the entire chest surface movement during breathing is achieved using the optical sensor system. Such monitoring and quantification of patient movement is directly relevant to gated radiotherapy and post-treatment verifications. Analysis of surface movement (height variations over time) in terms of mean and standard deviation should also be included in patient set-up procedures before radiotherapy treatment.

Automatic curve fairing system using visual languages
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Generally, in the field of industrial design, the measurement data of a clay model are faired, and a 3D model is made in CAD. However, it is a problem that this fairing work takes a long time and requires a great deal of labor. We propose an automatic curve fairing system for the application to reverse engineering technology. The system is constructed by the following five steps. (1) Key-line data are extracted from a clay model by a 3D digitizer. (2) The extracted key-line data are approximated by a spline with a genetic algorithm.

Towards a Web based CAD system
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Existing CAD systems are still monolithic and are based on complex geometrical models. Our aim is to implement a new approach, taking advantage of the possibilities of the World Wide Web and providing a novice end-user with an easy-to-use system. In order to get the same performance as a local system, it is necessary to provide our system with an adequate data representation and architecture. A study realised by our team has shown that classical models are based on information that is too low-level for our specifications and that a functional model is needed. This paper deals with our first results concerning the architecture which is to be the basis of different implementations, and it presents a first operational prototype. The first section introduces the tests we carried out in order to understand the advantages and drawbacks of different alternatives, and it describes the final choices for the architecture. The second section describes a prototype proving the feasibility of our approach. It is based on new intuitive interaction techniques, though we merely outline this point in this paper.

Wayfinding in virtual environments using an interactive spatial cognitive map
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
We illustrate how an interactive spatial cognitive map representation of a large-scale virtual space under navigation can be constructed in order to help solve navigation queries and formulate navigation commands. We explain our design, describe its implementation and present the evaluation results from a sample of 6 navigators. Our balanced-within experiment shows that our implementation results in a significant decrease in the physical demand experienced by participants to tackle set navigation tasks. The paper also introduces a novel algorithm for the capture and organisation of spatial knowledge resulting from navigation in a virtual environment. This algorithm is the basis of our navigation aid.

Linear programming concept visualization
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
A visualization scheme as a tool to find the solution of any 3D-linear programming problem is introduced. The presented approach is highly suitable to draw and visualize interactively the feasible region of a given 3D-linear programming problem. It can be used for a better understanding of the solution process when different methods devoted to solve the underlying problem are applied, e.g., the simplex method. The proposed technique comprises sensitive analysis during the solution process and interactive visualization of the feasible region. The analysis leading to the introduced schema also shows that the design of an appropriate and simple vertex representation is crucial to manage any order of degeneracy. To deal with this paradigm and to some extent to formalize it, the concept of adjacency invariance is introduced. Several experiments have been conducted to test and assess the performance of the introduced concepts and techniques.

Information visualisation for the architectural practice
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Information is a critical element for architects to accomplish their tasks. The overwhelming increase in and complexity of digital information has revealed problems concerning information acquisition. New techniques of handling information are needed to improve the transformation of data into information, and then into knowledge. Information visualisation (IV) is seen as one of these techniques. This paper discusses the importance of information in architectural practice and the potentials of utilizing IV techniques to improve the information acquisition process. The paper attempts to construct an application model for developing IV tools. It explores in detail four main factors that influence their successful application, which are: (1) the underlying data structure, (2) information-seeking strategies, (3) identification of IV techniques, and (4) analysing the user profile. Based on these factors, the paper critically examines different possible IV development approaches for architectural practice. These include: technology push, data structure-based and task-driven approaches.

Many professional educators who instruct courses in computer graphics programs have been mindful of teaching students those subjects required to become successful graduates in their field of study. However, many teachers and professors believe that we have not ensured that their students have always been properly prepared to deal with ethical issues associated with the work they will do in industry and business once they enter the world of work. We have not given adequate attention to the moral preparation that must also attend academic endeavors. Serious attention must be given to including courses in ethics that concentrate on the impact that computer graphics is having on a global scale.

Presents a method to connect VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) and Java components in a Web page using EAI (External Authoring Interface), which makes it possible to interactively generate and edit VRML meshes. The meshes used are based on regular grids, to provide an interaction and modeling approach that uses the internal semantics of such a mesh by linking the available modeling operations to either single vertices, the vertices of a ring or column, or all the vertices from the VRML mesh. Our method permits strict mesh complexity control and scales the operations according to the mesh properties. We describe the structure of the system and provide a few examples of the meshes that were created.

The author reports on the LISTEN project, a research project funded by the European Commission in the context of the Information Society Technology (IST) program. LISTEN, which started in January 2001, will provide users with intuitive access to personalized and situated audio information spaces while they naturally explore everyday environments. A new form of multisensory content is proposed to enhance the sensual impact of a broad spectrum of applications ranging from art installations to entertainment events. This is achieved by augmenting the physical environment through a dynamic soundscape, which users experience over motion-tracked wireless headphones. Immersive audio-augmented environments are created by combining high-definition spatial audio rendering technology with advanced user modeling methods. These allow for adapting the content to the users' individual spatial behavior. The project will produce several prototypes and a virtual reality based authoring tool. Technological innovations will be validated under laboratory conditions, whilst the prototypes will be evaluated in public exhibitions.

2001
A prototype system for immersive music editing and playing has been developed. The system enables one to edit musical notes and control playing in an immersive virtual environment using multimodal interfaces. The immersive virtual reality is suitable as a natural interface for many people. One can manipulate musical notes by hand, learn to read a musical score and understand the relationship between the score and sounds. The prototype system was implemented with the Java programming language, the Java3D class library, the JavaSound class library and an original library called "it3d". It works on a personal computer or a group of computers connected with a fast local area network where one computer executes the application body and others process input/output. The system is portable and expected to work on a wide range of hardware platforms.

A visualization method for the morphological exploration of tensegrity structures
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Tensegrities are a special type of tensile structures that offer a viable alternative to conventional space covering structures. The morphology of tensegrity networks is uniquely and directly related to their structural and mechanical properties. Geometric and topological complexity is a characteristic of the morphology of tensegrity structures and accounts for significant difficulties in the study of their initial configuration, and possibly, for their limited application in building design. In this paper a computer visualization method that involves animation procedures is proposed as a tool for the exploration of their form. The method is based on a graphical approach to the solution of their complex 3D geometry that combined CAD tools with descriptive geometry procedures. The display of the tensegrity structure as an animation of moving parts allows designers to assess the effect of a given geometric parameter on their architectural form.

Combining linking and focusing techniques for a multiple hierarchy visualisation
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Visualisations have previously combined linking and brushing operations successfully. However, none (to our knowledge) have combined linking and focusing techniques. We describe the motivation behind developing such a technique, and show how our visualisation takes advantage of inherent links in a set of multiple overlapping hierarchies to build a mechanism that can produce linked focus+context effects between these multiple hierarchies with a single user action. Previously, our visualisation had utilised linking only, using colour to highlight correlations between distinct but overlapping hierarchies.

Finite difference surface representation considering effect of boundary curvature
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Surface representation using the solution to a partial differential equation (PDE) is an important topic of computer graphics and computer-aided design. In existing references, various free-from surfaces were created with a 4th-order PDE, which is only able to meet the tangential conditions at the surface boundaries. The need for a 6th-order PDE in surface modelling arises in two situations: one is to generate surfaces with curvature continuity and the other is to use curvature values as a user handle for surface shape manipulation. In this paper, we introduce such a 6th-order PDE for free-form surface generation and develop a finite difference method to solve this PDE. We also investigate the effects of boundary curvature and the vector-valued shape parameters on the surface shape. It was found that their variation has a strong influence on the shape of the surfaces and that, therefore, they can be used as flexible user handles.

Dynamic queries and brushing on choropleth maps
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Users who must combine demographic, economic or other data in a geographic context are often hampered by the integration of tabular and map representations. Static, paper-based solutions limit the amount of data that can be placed on a single map or table. By providing an effective user interface, we believe that researchers, journalists, teachers, and students can explore complex data sets more rapidly and effectively. This paper presents Dynamaps, a generalized map-based information visualization tool for dynamic queries and brushing on choropleth maps. Users can use color coding to show a variable on each geographic region, and then filter out areas that do not meet the desired criteria. In addition, a scatterplot view and a details-on-demand window support overviews and specific fact-finding.

Client expectations of virtual environments for urban design development
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
This paper presents two case studies related to the application of virtual environments for urban design development based on an analysis of client expectations. Within the first study, community consultation is the focus of the application of the virtual environment, whereas the second study considers the application of the technology within the design development process. Therefore, the client is considered as both the community and designer as end users of the technology. In both studies a comparison is made between traditional tools used for urban design development and virtual environments. Findings from research indicate that both user groups have a preference for virtual environments. In certain aspects of the design development process, however development time, disruption to the design process and display medium all impact on the experience recorded.

View morphing using sprites with depth
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Recently there has been a great deal of interest in morphing techniques to produce intermediary images between two images. These techniques combine 2D interpolations of shape and color to make realistic special effects. The authors simulate view morphing, using sprites with depth about a pair of partially occluded images based on the epipolar geometry. The epipolar constraints improve the accuracy of the estimated disparity maps. To compute a depth map between two images, we use use a simple stereo system. Depth can be estimated from the disparity of corresponding points and is inversely proportional to disparity, used when sprites are composed. A sprite is an image with the standard three-color components (red, green, blue) and an additional channel that encodes the image's shape. In the case of a pair of partially occluded images, whether there should be decomposed sprites to an image is the reason for attributing to reduce two problems (folds and holes), in the view morphing procedures.

Visualising data using the ActionMapper: a proposed interactive event logger for user interface evaluation
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
The proposed ActionMapper tool extends previous work on the generic KeystrokeMapper tool to provide an efficient method of logging and visualising a novice user's interaction with a dynamic interface. For any specified task the ActionMapper could generate a graphic representation of both the designer's conceptual model (represented by an Optimum path) and an indication of the user's mental model (represented by the actual path navigated by the user). In this study, the results from two usability experiments have been analysed using the KeystrokeMapper concept. From this a refined version of the tool, referred to as ActionMapper, is outlined. It is argued that the future implementation of the ActionMapper concept as a computer-based tool, which includes the automatic analysis and visualisation of numerous usability metrics, will substantially enhance the evaluation process. By adding event recording functionality in a prototype for a small handheld device, effective usability evaluations could also be conducted in a mobile context.

The PC software AMCE provides building actors (owner, project authors...) with a multiple criteria decision aid (MCDA) procedure to optimise the building envelope cost and energy performance, during sketch design, when most important choices are fixed. Two main modules are linked: (i) the first manages parameters describing the project requirements; (ii) the graphic pen-based module allows one to draw the sketch, it calculates geometric parameter values and puts them back in the first module. Informed about foreseeable performances, the user can, at any time, search for the optimal scenario giving the best satisfaction (monoactor optimisation) or most preferred compromise (multiactor optimisation), he is given a lot of graphs illustrating the performance sensitivity to parameter variations, as well as an optimisation procedure using a genetic algorithm to find the most efficient parameter set.

2001
The transmission of 3D shape models via the Internet has become one of the hottest issues these days. Presented in this paper is a new approach for the rapid transmission of the geometric data of a shape model. By analysing three important factors for the data compression (the shape fidelity, the file size and the decompression time), we point out the potential problems with the previous approach of using the deltas between consecutive vertices and we propose an alternative of directly using the position values of the vertices of the model. It turns out that the proposed approach has a smaller file size, it has less distortion in the model, and the decompression is faster.

Many authors have so far studied the problem of geometric construction in CAD from a combinatorial point of view. The derived algorithms are efficient but not general enough. Moreover the problem of robustness is seldom mentioned. We expose a logical framework of geometric construction which points out the difficulties to overcome in order to implement a correct geometric universe. We think that this precise study of the particularities of geometry is necessary to obtain a robust geometric solver.

Construction site management mainly involves the rational layout of site facilities, optimum usage of space and dynamic management of plants. It directly influences security, machine running, material supply and power distribution, as well as construction progress and cost. Applying computers to visual site layout has become a hot topic, attracting many researchers. This paper presents the interactive 4D Construction Site Management System (CSMS). In CSMS, a 4D site management model (4DSMM) is generated, which links a 3D model of construction project with a project activity schedule, each activity suitably annotated with its resource requirements, including material, plant and work space. The system provides a 4D visualization capability for the layout of construction facilities, the use of the site space and intelligent decisions based on a knowledge base. The application of 4D intelligent site management is seen to have considerable potential.

Visual authoring tool for presentation agent based on Multimodal Presentation Markup Language

2001
The paper proposes a visual authoring tool for a presentation agent system on the Web. In presentation systems, it is more fascinating when we conduct the presentation stream via the explanation or conversation of presenters. In order to provide a presentation on demand on the Web, we need a character based presentation agent. There are several ways to control such agents but some are too complex to be used by general users; we propose an easy method for controlling agents. For this purpose, we have developed Multimodal Presentation Markup Language (MPML), which allows many users to write attractive multimodal presentations easily. MPML is a markup language conforming to Extensible Markup Language (XML) and it supports functions for controlling verbal presentation and agent behavior. The authors present MPML's specification, visual authoring tool, and the application of MPML when used as a tool for composing multimodal presentations on the WWW.

Visualising document content with metadata to facilitate goal-directed search

Much corporate knowledge is captured in documents. This paper describes the design and evaluation of an application, named Gridvis, which uses metadata to enable rapid goal-directed searches within corporate documents. Gridvis visualises metadata that describes and differentiates the contents of individual paragraphs. This visualisation is used as the basis for rapid querying and navigation. An experimental evaluation of Gridvis's performance on representative work tasks is described. Qualitative analysis of the data suggests that there is substantial room for performance improvement, and has inspired design changes to realise this potential. Quantitative analysis proved inadequate to detect a numerical advantage due to the sample size restrictions inherent when doing academic research in a corporate setting. The problems of empirical evaluation in a corporate setting are discussed. An alternative approach to reliable evaluation is proposed.

As designers, we are faced with a more heterogeneous group of customers, product users and learners. Learning styles, multiculturalism, and age demographics are just some of the factors that contribute to this diversity. As designers and design educators, it is our mission to look at new ways to deliver instructional material and information in an effort to propose a new paradigm in the delivery of this content. Our results of teaching at The Ohio State University are demonstrated through a variety of interactive multimedia programs focused on the objective of teaching and learning. Each student project in some way challenges current conventions in linear, static educational, and information processes. These dynamic programs, incorporating semantic typography, sound, video, and animation offer multiple but logical paths of navigation. Student designers explore how information design (complex information or systems) can be made more accessible by engaging the user through interactivity. Additional project criteria include the application of an appropriate and effective architectural structure, effective interface design, and strong typographic principles.

The MOST immersive approach for parallel and distributed program analysis
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Examining a program's state during execution is of major importance for software developers when analyzing an application for performance tuning or error detection. This demand for suitable analysis tools is further pushed by parallel and distributed programs, which process huge amounts of complex data. A solution to this problem is offered by visualization, such that even a large amount of data can be presented efficiently for the user's investigations. This paper presents an immersive approach, where monitoring and steering activities combined with virtual reality visualization components help the user to understand the behavior of running parallel and distributed programs. On the one hand, program visualization tries to induce a "feeling" for the program. On the other hand, data visualization provides a facility to display preliminary results of any kind of scientific calculations.

This paper describes a systematic approach to optimize Internet distribution of GIS vector maps. The goal is to reduce user-perceived response time and improve viewers' navigation efficiency. At the center of this approach is a hierarchical content management model. Each multiple-layer vector map is divided into partitions, or blocks, of a predetermined size to build a hierarchy. This size is chosen so that most compressed blocks can be downloaded reasonably quickly at typical connection speeds. A front-end cache and a novel application-level locality-based pre-fetching method are devised. Experiments with a Java prototype have shown smooth panning and fast zooming when large map data sets are accessed.

Design and implementation of a Web-based distributed collaborative design environment
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
This paper reviews work on distributed collaborative virtual design environments and the emerging technology of metacomputing. The paper discusses the design of distributed collaborative design environments using metacomputing, for example Globus, to provide intensive data computing via an asynchronous collection of loosely synchronous components. The essential component, Globus, focuses on defining a toolkit of low-level services for security, communication, resource location, resource allocation, process management, and data access. Based on this approach, the requirements for concept, functionality and performance of the design environments are provided. The key functions in the distributed collaborative design environments such as analysis, visualisation, security and database management, particularly the 3D design storage and visualisation, are also discussed. Finally, further work on implementing Globus-based distributed collaborative design environments is highlighted.

A boundary representation technique for three-dimensional objects
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
The marching cubes algorithm of W.E. Lorensen and H.E. Cline (1987) is a method that is used frequently in 3D object visualisation. The underlying concept of the technique is to form piecewise planar approximations to surfaces, for which pre-determined normals are used for shading purposes. It should be noted that these approximations are precisely as accurate as the data given; there is no loss in quality or error introduced. The approach of using these cubes to represent data can also be used to fully describe the piecewise planar approximation to the surface. Problems arise however, in terms of the storage space required for the representation of large objects, and it is this issue that is addressed in this paper. We present an algorithm that transforms pixel-wise data into a boundary representation that has potential for large reductions in storage. The algorithm does not involve any further approximation of the surface of the object than that given as input. The algorithm also provides a structure that makes surface analysis and matching very simple.

Visualization issues in telepathology: the role of the Internet Imaging Protocol
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Image visualization may become a difficult task in telemedicine, especially when large data sets are to be delivered through the Internet and selectively analyzed by the physician. A new protocol - the Internet Imaging Protocol, IIP - has been recently proposed by a consortium of companies, with the aim of distributing efficiently multiresolution images on the WWW, for both visualization and printing purposes. The proposed protocol is indeed sufficiently general to be considered for a wide range of applications. The present paper analyses it from the point of view of telepathology, i.e., the transmission of medical images coming from microscopes. We argue that pathology images can be delivered by means of the IIP, with advantages on the visualization interface, which closely reproduces the direct use of a microscope. A sample application is presented, aimed at delivering pathology cases for second opinion diagnosis as well as for continuing medical education.

Solving geometric constraints by a hybrid method
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
In computer aided design, geometric modelling by constraints enables users to describe geometric objects by geometric constraints. Many resolution methods have been proposed for solving systems of geometric constraints. Geometric methods can be very efficient but are only applicable to particular kinds of problems (typically ruler and compass constructive problems). Numerical methods can deal with all types of constraints but are time consuming. We present a hybrid method to solve the geometric constraints by combining geometric solving with numerical methods. We "benefit" then of the advantages of the two methods.

Visualized construction process on virtual reality
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
The proposed construction process visualization system (4D-VR, 4 Dimension Virtual Reality) is applied to a large and complicated project that requires milestone schedule management and detailed activity control. The 4D-VR has a software structure with five modules, which are 3D CAD modeling, virtual reality modeling, schedule data processing, linking graphic data with schedule data, and visualization output modules. A field application has been carried out on 4D-VR for a 27-story complex building project for an apartment and commercial store in Korea. After analyzing the case, we conclude that the 4D-VR system can enhance communication between managers and workers, and help a project manager to reasonable decision making for establishing the schedule. Moreover, 4D-VR is effective for shortening the schedule, showing the exact construction process and making various presentations to co-workers related to the project. This paper shows the status of 4D-VR technology in Korea and how to use it in a real project.

A method of using a dynamic texture on 3D polylines to represent field streamlines is described for the purpose of visualizing continuous fluid dynamic fields. The method combines stream lines and particle animation into one hybrid technique, and employs texture display on lines to represent full 3D lighting, motion and 3D flow structure in one view. The technique exploits texture graphics systems in common use for games, and achieves high graphics efficiency during animation.

Thinning Arabic characters for feature extraction
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
A successful approach to the recognition of Latin characters is to extract features from that character such as the number of strokes, stroke intersections and holes, and to use ad-hoc tests to differentiate between characters which have similar features. The first stage in this process is to produce thinned 1 pixel thick representations of the characters to simplify feature extraction. This approach works well with printed Latin characters which are of high quality. With poor quality characters, however, the thinning process itself is not straightforward and can introduce errors which are manifested in the later stages of the recognition process. The recognition of poor quality Arabic characters is a particular problem since the characters are calligraphic with printed characters having widely varying stroke thicknesses to simulate the drawing of the character with a calligraphy pen or brush. This paper describes the problems encountered when thinning large poor quality Arabic characters prior to the extraction of their features and submission to a syntactic recognition system.

Spatial representation in product modelling
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
An unambiguous definition of space is necessary before any attempt is made to develop product or process models for concurrent engineering in the AEC Industry. The ambiguity is the result of different and even conflicting approaches to its definition in the various phases of the building life cycle for different stakeholders, e.g. architects, engineers, and building services engineer etc. Some researchers consider space as an abstract property of things, while others consider it as a thing itself. Regardless of the definition, the space can be referred to as a collector of material objects and also as an object itself. This paper investigates the existing concepts and criteria of definition in various phases, compares the factual and ontological meaning, and specifies conceptual schemas for representation of space, geometry, and buildings.

Capturing outline of fonts using genetic algorithm and splines
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
In order to obtain a good spline model from large measurement data, we frequently have to deal with knots as variables, which becomes a continuous, non-linear and multivariate optimization problem with many local optima. Hence, it is very difficult to obtain a global optima. We present a method to convert the original problem into a discrete combinatorial optimization problem and solve it by a genetic algorithm. We also incorporate a corner detection algorithm to detect significant points which are necessary to capture a pleasant looking spline fitting for shapes such as fonts. A parametric B-Spline has been approximated to various characters and symbols. The chromosomes have been constructed by considering the candidates of the locations of knots as genes. The best model among the candidates is searched by using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The method determines the appropriate number and location of knots automatically and simultaneously. Some examples are given to show the results obtained from the algorithm.

A simulation environment for construction site planning
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
This paper presents the design of a simulation environment for the modelling, visualisation and optimisation of construction site layouts. This construction site workspace application aims to support the site planning task by analysing space and risk on the site and generating automated site layouts which satisfy a combination of cost, efficiency and safety criteria. The construction site simulation environment forms part of an EU funded project called DIVERCITY (Distributed Virtual Workspace for enhancing Communication within the Construction Industry). This is concerned with the development of virtual simulation prototypes to support the client briefing, design review, and construction planning stages of the construction process. The site analysis module comprises a safety analysis component, a space analysis component, and an optimisation component. The safety analysis component is a generic model for the graphical and numerical representation of risk/hazard spaces. The space analysis component represents and classifies the various spaces on the construction site according to their relative importance in terms of accessibility and visibility. The optimisation component takes safety and space analysis information, and performs site layout optimisation according to travelling distance minimisation, risk minimisation, and space use maximisation criteria.

Interactive visualization method for exploratory data analysis
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
We propose an interactive visualization method suitable for exploratory data analysis. In this type of data analysis, statistical charts are employed to help the user understand the target data, and a displayed chart is redrawn interactively according to the user's input inspired by looking at the chart. Two factors must be considered if the chart is to be suitably redrawn: the type of chart displayed and the parts of the chart that are changed by the user's input. We developed our proposed method based on these factors. As the first step of the method, the part to change and the details to meet the given user's input for the displayed chart are interpreted. Then, a semantic frame used to generate a statistical chart from data is updated by the results of the interpretation, and several candidates as appropriate chart-types are chosen based on the frame and chart-type determination rules. Finally, the most preferable chart is chosen from among the candidates according to the type of user input, and the displayed chart is transformed into a new chart with animation. By using this method, data can be visualized interactively according to the change of the user's viewpoint without interrupting the thinking process.

Rapid visualization of geometric information in a construction environment
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
A construction workspace is a dynamic environment that allows little time to obtain and update the graphical and image modeling information that is required in construction equipment operations. Comprehensive 3D models of the workspace require computationally intensive and expensive imaging processing, and usually take much longer than the ongoing construction operations permit. Rapid 3D positioning and modeling in construction can be used to plan, visualize and communicate operations before execution. They can also help to optimize equipment operations, significantly improve safety and enhance a remote operator's spatial perception of the workspace. This paper presents a rapid method, by combining human-assisted graphical workspace modeling with pre-stored CAD models and simple sensors (such as single-axis laser range-finders and remote video cameras), which can significantly reduce the modeling time while potentially increasing the modeling accuracy.

Visualisation to assist non-speaking users of augmentative communication systems
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Many non-speaking people use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems to assist them to communicate with other people. Access to an AAC system is generally slow for its user, who may have other disabilities as well as being non-speaking. An AAC system can contain stored words, messages and stories for use in communication, and there can be a large quantity of such information for the user to search through and select from while he or she is trying to participate in conversation. New user interface techniques are required to assist a user to navigate through the information stored in an AAC system and select appropriate items for use during live conversation. Information visualisation techniques may be able to assist a user to overview and appraise the contents of an AAC system as part of that selection process, and therefore improve its efficiency of use. This paper outlines key AAC issues and explores visualisation techniques which may be of value in an AAC context.

A variety of computer technologies have been applied to the field of civil engineering today. Visualization of structural design results focuses on geometry, modeling and simulation, ranging from static 2D images to dynamic 3D graphics. In recent years, advancements in multimedia, virtual reality and the Internet have given new prospects to visual aids for structural design. This paper presents the initial results of modeling steel structures in a virtual reality environment for interactive design examination and evaluation. Structural building designs are generated by a knowledge-based design system and converted to VRML models automatically, which allows 3D steel frames to be observed in Web browsers. Geometry and connective relations can be examined in arbitrary directions while the user walks through a scene, and detailed structural analysis and design results can be queried by touching the structural elements.

Intentions: logical and subversive. The art of Marcel Duchamp, concept visualization, and immersive experience
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Examines the intersection of symbolic logic, immersive experience (virtual reality) and concept visualization in the interpretation of the oeuvre of Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968). Influenced by the mathematicians Henri Poincare/spl acute/ and Elie Jouffret, as well as by his own intense practice of chess and logic, Duchamp sought to merge the poetic and visceral nature of the aesthetic experience with the logical and systematic character of science. This convolution of elements as disparate as chance, 3D and 4D space-time, linguistics, logic and authorship does not allow for comfortable definitive explanation but rather one, like his work itself, that engages simultaneous multi-dimensional thinking. Duchamp questioned the purpose of 'retinal art', art which is merely visually beautiful, and examined the limitations of science as a singular method of interpreting and communicating experience. The body of his work stands as a systematic yet playful critique of deterministic reasoning. Using symbolic logic to characterize the most common interpretations of Duchamp's work, the author suggests that concept visualization in 3D immersive experience offers a unique method for exploring and introducing the complex lattices of interpretation, intention and concept in the work of Duchamp.

PCIS - a visual decision tool for construction and design management
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Demonstrates the potential of PCIS (Piece-based Construction Information System) as a visualization tool for technical cooperation, collaboration and communication by literally aligning the points of view of architectural, engineering and construction methodologies. There is always complexity during an actual construction or assembly, wherein the sequence is mostly always confused, and this leads to wastage of time, materials and manpower. The pictorial database PCIS, as a decision-aid tool, provides information in a sequence that is often forgotten or missed in construction. PCIS has three components. The first is an anatomical model, functionally organized according to ASTM UNIFORMAT II. This programmatic standard means the model can be sequentially constructed and deconstructed according to a standard work breakdown structure that is tailored to the requirements of almost any building. The second component of PCIS is the dataTheater that surrounds the anatomical model. The theater sets up a combination of 2D data planes that can be hypergraphically accessed to view layout dimensions, details and specifications. The third part of PCIS is the dataWorld, with cameras fixed to the intersections of its latitudes and longitudes. The cameras attached to the dataTheater and dataWorld control the visual display of the pictorial information. A software engine polls the cameras and publishes the images in a set of directories as files that are accessed by the hypergraphic interface. The information visible to these cameras can be changed through a standard survey matrix.

An interactive and concerted dance system - emotion extraction and support for emotional concert
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
A human activity that expresses one's emotion is significantly important in non-verbal communications. Human body motion such as a dance performance is one of the important factors in expressing such an emotion. An effective method to extract emotional information in real time from dance images is described. A novel heuristic function is also proposed to evaluate the degree of harmony between two dancers. As a typical application, a dance system called MIDAS that interactively combines dancers' images with video, sound, and CG characters is introduced. MIDAS can visualize how well dancers are in harmony with each other and encourage their expressions.

Elimination the influence of the mesh geometry to the quality of global smoothing
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
In the last years computer performance has become very high, solution methods have been developed, so more and more numerical calculations can be done in an acceptable time. That is one reason why such methods are being used very frequently. However, not only the calculation itself, but also the visualisation of the data places a challenge on the techniques used. Simulation results have very special properties which have to be considered for the visualisation. Ignoring this fact produces an output that makes it impossible to produce confidence in the results. A high quality display of the results in real time is necessary, in order to sell the numerical simulation to a large audience. But the basic characteristics of the data must not be changed in order to keep the basic message. The techniques described here fulfil this very important requirement of scientific information visualisation.

A novel method for accelerating the visualisation process used in virtual colonoscopy
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Virtual colonoscopy is a non-invasive technique with the potential for wide application in the early detection of colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, to be clinically useful, it is reliant on the rapid visualisation of three-dimensional (3D) data using personal computers. This is not possible using current visualisation techniques. We present a novel method to accelerate volume rendering via ray casting as used in virtual colonoscopy. The method uses a space leaping technique in which the space inside the colon is approximated by maximal spheres constructed using the distance transform of the cavity. These spheres enable subsequent ray casting to traverse the space in an efficient way. The method has been implemented on a personal computer and is approximately 2.9 times faster when compared to the usual ray casting method for virtual colonoscopy. Potential uses of this method extend beyond virtual colonoscopy to all endoscopic applications and indeed any volume rendering application involving voxels with uniform properties.

The general variables concept: a simple step from single- to multi-user environment

2001
When implementing multi-user cooperation systems in a networked virtual environment, synchronizing local representations of a shared virtual world has to be considered. It involves distributing and storing the data that represent users' activity in the virtual world. The authors propose a concept of general variables, which formalizes the task of distributing, journaling and locking the data in the client-server model. To verify the employability of the concept, we have implemented a Java bundle comprising a server and a client-side library. Four multi-user applications are presented to demonstrate that with the help of the bundle, a single-user application can be turned into a multi-user one with minimum effort.

Solving geometric metric constraints is a topical issue in CAD. An original way to solve a constraint system is to use geometric methods, providing a symbolic construction plan. Then, this plan can be numerically interpreted to generate the required figure. If multiple solutions are produced, most solvers propose to scan the entire space of the solutions found, that is generally tedious. We show how the inner properties of a symbolic solver allow to deal more efficiently with this case. After briefly recalling our sketch-based selection method, that enables to easily eliminate most of the solutions and to keep the only, or at worst the few solutions that have the best likeness with the original drawing, we introduce a new step by step interpretation mechanism implemented as a debugger-like tool, that allows to browse the remaining solutions tree in order to help the user choosing the required solution.

Visualisation of the degradation of building flooring systems
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
The development of a maintenance programme for construction projects is a highly complex and data intensive undertaking. This exercise is characterised by the lack of relevant data on the one hand and the overwhelming amount of irrelevant data on the other. This is partly due to the existence of numerous events which act upon the building and that all buildings contain many components, each with several varieties. The complexity of the process is exacerbated by the fact that the interaction between the events and building components extends over the lifetime of the project. The uncertainties and complexities have resulted in increased conservatism in the development of life cycle evaluation of building performance and maintenance programme development. Subsequently, almost all maintenance programmes tend to display the symptoms of one or both of the following pitfalls: maintenance actions are too early, thus uneconomical; and maintenance actions are too late, thus compromising the quality of service. The current research project is based on the premise that the visual approach to maintenance programme development offers a viable solution to the above pitfalls. However, the retrospective nature of the problem suggests that the only practical visual approach is one which relies on the use of virtual simulation of the building. Therefore the aim of the broader research is to develop a 4D visual model of building degradation through time. The focus is on building flooring systems.

A scalable approach to visualization of large virtual cities
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Visualization of large urban complexes on the Web is a highly demanding task both from the networking and computational point of view. The whole three-dimensional model of a city is mostly too big to be downloaded in a reasonable time and to be stored in a memory of commonly used computers. This paper presents a scalable approach for subdividing an urban model into smaller parts. Dynamic loading and unloading data allows theoretically unlimited extension of a model with constant network and computation load. Further requirements specific to presentation of virtual cities are also discussed. Theoretical considerations are followed by a practical implementation utilizing the VRML language for modeling the historical city of Prague.

Provides advanced visualization and interaction paradigms to support Web browsing through the intensive use of bookmarks, navigation history and best-of lists. Our approach is motivated by past studies of Web browsing patterns that proved the usefulness of such tools even though standard browsers provide very few interaction and visualization features for them. In this paper, we first motivate our work and present our main visualization and interaction paradigms. We then present the architecture we used to integrate interactive visualization with normal Web navigation. We then review lessons learned. Further, we report the results of a preliminary comparative user study conducted to evaluate the effect of the use of our visualization and interaction techniques on user performances.

This study developed a multi-user 3D virtual environment system. The system must achieve two goals: portability, it can be embedded to any kind of platform; and coherence with other systems, it can reuse shared objects such as worlds and avatars from other systems. The following work has been done as part of this research: the design issues have been explored in detail; an architecture is proposed that overcomes several existing limitations; a functional prototype system that implements the architecture has been implemented; and the system has been tested and results are given.

A conceptual framework for a decision support system for colour selection and use in the design of the built environment
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Computer visualisation is a common tool within modern architectural design to improve productivity and communication. Whilst this may be the case, there is evidence that architects are abusing these new tools in the provision of new designs. Colour representation is a major factor within architectural design, but appears neglected within the development of computer technology. This paper outlines the conceptual framework for a decision support system devised to improve the validity of colour representation in computer visualisation and improve architect-client interaction in the design process, whilst addressing the co-variables which affect the perceptual process of colour and computerised architectural design.

A study on the real-time toon rendering for 3D geometry model
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Non-photorealistic rendering techniques, such as cartoon (or toon) rendering, can greatly enhance the quality of hand-drawn cel animation images, and with less effort. For this reason, toon rendering is one of the most popular techniques used in the cel animation image production field. Existing toon rendering techniques, however, have not been effective enough for real-time image processing. Because these techniques have not been adequate for certain processes that need immediate response, such as virtual reality or video games, this paper suggests a real-time toon rendering method to overcome this limitation via real-time outline detection and Phong shading. In addition, an effective resulting image can be produced by adding a shadow using a fast shadow-generating algorithm, while real-time execution remains possible.

Cognitive effects of animated visualization in exploratory visual data analysis
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
The goal of this research is to study the role and effects of the use of animated information visualization in the early stages of exploratory data analysis tasks. Despite the existence of a large body of research on information visualization, there is little known regarding how and when one should use and how to interact with animated visualization to help explore data. By animated visualization, we mean a type of information visualization technique that produces autonomous motions of representations. This research explored the issue from two aspects: what cognitive effects animated information visualization has, and what interactions people have with animated visualization when exploring data. We conducted two user studies to investigate each aspect, and identified research challenges for designing an interactive animated information visualization environment that supports the early stages of exploratory data analysis. These findings help us further study how to extend the notions developed in spatial visualization to temporal visualization - e.g. what focus+context means when applied to the time dimension in animated visualization.

Slice-based virtual endoscopy navigation
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Navigation path planning is a crucial part of virtual endoscopy, but the identification of the optimal fly-through path is a time-intensive process. This paper describes a prototype system for virtual endoscopy and proposes a slice-based approach to calculating the path of the virtual camera that uses the slice borderlines of region-of-interest images to obtain the approximate centreline, centralised locally with respect to the hollow object wall. By using the 2D slice borderlines to express the hollow object boundary, the path searching and polygon intersection computing are simplified and made more efficient. Finally, we present results of our algorithm tested on the Visible Human data set.

Skeletal implicit surface reconstruction from sections for flexible body simulation
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
We describe an automatic surface reconstruction technique from a set of planar data points organised in parallel sections. The reconstruction employs skeletal implicit surfaces. Two key points in this study are: calculation of the 3D skeleton by establishing a correspondence between each paid of the 2D Voronoi skeleton of two neighbouring sections; and the use of a uniform field function necessitating the introduction of the notion of "weighted skeleton". Another key point of this work is the proposition of an animation methodology by transforming the skeleton into a deformable mass/spring system. This work has been used in the context of a medical project to simulate the dynamic behaviour of organs during the conformal radiotherapy treatment.

A design tool for the hierarchical hair model
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Modeling, designing and rendering realistic human hair is one of the most challenging topics in computer graphics. The difficulty mainly comes from the large amount of hair, the fine shapes of the individual hairs, and the complex illuminating interactions among hairs and surrounding objects. An enhanced interactive hair styling system - V-HairStudio, based on our previous work, is developed to design complex hair styles represented by a hierarchical hair model. This design tool provides a rich set of functionalities with multiple levels of abstraction. Due to the hierarchical representation, complex hair styles can be handled with reduced design efforts.

Improving the retrieval performance of content-based image retrieval systems: the GIVBAC approach
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
The retrieval performance of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems still leaves much to be desired, especially when the system is serving as an interface to an image collection covering many different topics. The problem of missing semantical information about the images leads to great numbers of false matches because of misleading similarities in the visual primitives that are retrieved. This paper introduces an approach called GIVBAC, that tries to reduce the number of false matches in query result sets. It relies heavily on user feedback on retrieval results with regard to user-definable thematic groups. Feedback is used globally, i.e. the feedback of one user has influences on the behaviour of the whole system. The weight of individual votes is a parameter of GIVBAC so that it can be adjusted to the level of trust the user base is given, i.e. higher values in a closed user group and lower values in an open group with anonymous users. The paper presents results of an evaluation comparing the performance of an unmodified CBIR system with a system that is modified so that it uses GIVBAC as an interface to the users.

Computer visualisation as a communication tool in the construction industry
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Computer visualisation tools offer good visualisation capabilities that cannot be achieved using traditional methods, such as 2D drawings. Design details are not always simple and easy to understand. Builders may spend considerable time on interpreting difficult or complex details in a drawing; this could result in buildability problems. Computer visualisation tools have considerable potential to improve this aspect of construction. However, their use is still at present limited and not fully understood. This paper presents an ongoing research project demonstrating the possible use of computer visualisation as a communication tool for design information and to support collaboration between construction participants (designers and contractors). An industry survey has been conducted to investigate the current use of computer visualisation in the construction industry. A summary of the survey results is presented in this paper and the outline features of a new visualisation tool is presented.

A study of three browser history mechanisms for Web navigation

2001
Finding a previously visited page during Web navigation is a very common and important process. Although most commercial browsers incorporate a history mechanism, when accessing pages that were recently visited, users still rely mainly on the "Back" button. In this paper, we studied the effectiveness of visually enhanced history browser mechanisms on Web navigation. We used three different history mechanisms as the experiment treatments. 21 college students were the subjects of the experimental trials. With a between-subject design, three experimental groups were equally divided according to subject profiles. Users read and completed the given scenario. A quiz was given to measure user performance on the tested mechanism. At the end of the quiz, a subjective questionnaire was given to measure user satisfaction. The results showed that there is a significant statistical difference among the three mechanisms. The more visually enhanced history mechanism provided to be more effective in Web browsing.

Digitally manipulated images and painting
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Discusses the artist's use of digitally manipulated images sourced from photographic studies from nature and used a visual resource for canvas painting. Traditional approaches to canvas painting have included various paths of image preparation prior to the actual application of paint to canvas. This presentation reveals the artist's approach to utilizing digital technology as a means for exploring ideas related to formal considerations of composition and color through image manipulation within Adobe Photoshop. Images that originate as original photographic studies from nature are manipulated, printed as hard copy and used as source for the final paintings on canvas. These canvas paintings are large in scale and are executed within the synthetic acrylic medium. Occasionally, the hard-copy images are re-manipulated as collage pieces and/or re-scanned and re-processed through the software. The final paintings, however, are not totally pre-determined by the digitized images. Alterations are made throughout the process of creating the paintings. Considerations of actual surface texture, color transparency, and numerous other characteristics not available for manipulation through image digitization all partake and influence the final outcome. The presentation includes a slide representation of the entire process involved in creating the final paintings from the initial photographs, digitization and the final, physical act of painting on canvas. The use of traditional materials within art and the relationship of new technologies within that process is an important underlying issue.

Image based rendering using rational filters
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Image based rendering is a powerful technique for 3D object visualization and representation. Using this approach, arbitrary object or scene views are generated automatically from a small set of real reference images. An algorithm for image based rendering using stereo image pairs is presented. The main goal is to produce a realistic 3D 'continuous look-around' effect along the stereo baseline. To minimize the distortion of the reconstructed pixels due to undefined disparity values, a nonlinear interpolator is proposed. It uses the sparse available disparity map to generate a dense field that partially reconstructs original disparity edge information, producing a sharper intermediate view. The identification of occluded and non-occluded areas is also used to aid the view synthesis process. A special treatment for occluded image areas is also considered in the proposed technique. Several computer experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the presented method.

Visualizing capacity and load in production planning
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Production planning is difficult not just because of the intricate relationships between the myriads of parameters, but also the dynamic nature of changes in the decision making environment. Good visualization tools for production planning are rare. Production planning is not merely an optimization problem. The possibility of making incremental manual changes will allow the planner to be more responsive to the dynamic changes in businesses today. The paper reports on a study prompted by the production planning of metal ingot casting. To visualize the production capacity and the current load in production planning, we focused on the potential bottle-neck machines, namely, the melting furnace and the pre-heat oven. We developed models of these machines which capture their special characteristics relevant to planning. Using our models in the load graphs of these machines, we were able to visualize the loading situation and the available production capacity. The visual models facilitate direct manipulation by a human planner to interact with a production plan to make incremental changes, with the impact of the change verified automatically. Visualization with the interactive techniques will augment advanced planning systems to provide better versatility and enhance usability.

A multimodal image fusion framework applied in radiotherapy

The monitoring of patients position during treatment in radiotherapy requires suitable real-time vizualization tools which provide a maximum of information. Often, only Electronic Portal Images (EPIs), which are of poor quality, exist for the dynamical verification of position deviations, whereas static image material of higher quality is available from diagnostics and treatment planning. A framework for the fusion of static and dynamic multimodal image data is proposed, which is based on the several image sources existing in radiotherapy.

Visualisation of a simple beam under a load in virtual environment
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Visualisation is generally considered to be a problem in structural design. Being an iterative process, structural design is time consuming for engineers, and results are difficult for clients to visualize. Current numerical methods have slow dynamic visualisation capability, which is usually separate from the calculation phase. The paper investigates whether an analogue virtual reality (VR) model of a structure can integrate calculation and visual representation. Early results of this research show that it is possible to have analogue virtual reality models of structures capable of real time user interaction. The paper shows how the user can interact with a VR analogue model of a simple beam, move a concentrated load along the length of the beam, change the value of the force, and visualise deflection of the beam using the analytical solution of the problem.

We develop a prototype system and show that complex rules which are hard to understand in text are easy to understand by diagrams.

Virtual access to landscapes and historic gardens at linked locations
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
Since 1997 staff at UWE have been exploring the use of underlying spatial databases which may be used to manage 3D modelling and related information. The term spatial database or spatial information system (SIS) is used as more inclusive of different domains than 'geographic' information system (GIS), although commercial GIS may satisfactorily serve this and many similar functions. The question of when it is useful to model and when video or high-resolution images may be equally or more useful has also been examined. A new project, 'Valhalla', offers the opportunity to test these approaches as a basis for the integration of 3D modelling with real-time video for the online comparative study of landscapes and historic gardens. While the project is based on possibly the most ephemeral and at-risk portion of our architectural heritage it is hypothesized that the approach could be equally applicable to building sites and to archaeological digs.

Dynamic background correction in 3Dt body surface sensing and visualisation
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
The sensing and visualisation of 3D body surface information is being researched for clinical use in the radiation treatment of cancer, where accurate patient set-up and positional monitoring is essential. Where 3D measurement is based on the projection of structured light onto the patient it is neccessary to remove background detail prior to extracting patient surface topology. Rapid background changes render a single pre-emptive determination of background useless. Instead it becomes necessary to update background information at video-rates. This precludes disruptive pauses for the physical collection of background data. The paper describes a method of generating background data from the video images of the structured light projection itself. Results are presented to show that image frame processing that includes a randomised element of structural spreading is the key to successfully implementing real-time background correction.

The transition from traditional graphics into computer graphics over the past decade has brought about a multitude of changes which graphic educators and other graphic professionals have had to address and incorporate into their curriculum or industry. The ever evolving integration of computer aided design (CAD) into the architectural and engineering areas have revolutionized the design and construction documentation process. But, when is it cost effective to utilize 2D, 3D or 4D CAD in the construction documentation processes or in business practice? A problem that most professionals are encountering is when to utilize the most technology has to offer and when to get by with minimal standards. This paper discusses the components of 2D, 3D and 4D CAD in construction communication documentation and when professionals and educators should utilize these different types of drawings.

Query by attention: visually searchable information maps

2001
This paper explores how the design of information spaces might be grounded in knowledge of human visual processing, notably what kinds of visual selection are most efficient. Information maps spatially array graphical symbols representing items of information and their attributes. Ideally their users should be able to do query by attention: answer questions about the information quickly by controlling visual attention (i.e., through spatial selection and visual search), instead of manipulating an interface. I propose a preliminary method for designing visually searchable maps based on experimental results about what kinds of visual search are easy. The hope is that the resulting maps will better employ the perceptual capabilities of their viewers when they search. An example information map of recent movies illustrates the approach.

Adaptive fairing of surface meshes by geometric diffusion
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
In triangulated surface meshes, there are often very noticeable size variances (the vertices are distributed unevenly). The presented noise of such surface meshes is therefore composite of vast frequencies. We solve a diffusion partial differential equation numerically for noise removal of arbitrary triangular manifolds using an adaptive time discretization. The proposed approach is simple and is easy to incorporate into any uniform timestep diffusion implementation with significant improvements over evolution results with the uniform timesteps. As an additional alternative to the adaptive discretization in the time direction, we also provide an approach for the choice of an adaptive diffusion tensor in the diffusion equation.

Describes approaches to the visualisation of customer behaviour and proposes an innovative metaphor for information visualisation. The helix metaphor is adopted as a technique to render behavioural temporal data in a user interface design incorporating a 3D representation. The helix metaphor extends the conceptual model of a spiral representation along a linear perspective, and accommodates the visualisation of temporal data by exploiting the cyclical nature of the data. A set of user task requirements was identified, and a brief informal series of task-based user trials revealed that these tasks were supported by the helix representation. Requirements for further design iterations of the helix representation are also proposed.

Communication through making marks is a fundamental human instinct. Humans have always used the act of drawing as a means to express ideas, emotions and to record actions. Currently, the discipline of drawing is being profoundly influenced, and perhaps forever changed, by the proliferation of new drawing media, technologies and diverse approaches to making marks through digital means. As such, the perception and understanding of what constitutes drawing is rapidly expanding. Simultaneously, many graphic artists are expanding upon historical approaches to drawing. The early 21st Century is a time when the dialogue between innovation and tradition has never been stronger. This paper seeks to explore this dialogue by embracing the breadth of what drawing is and to conjecture on where drawing might go in the immediate future by exploring the use of new technologies, elaborating the impact of continuing traditions of drawings, and to engage the expanding range of ideas that are brought to this basic form of human expression. As we enter into this new millennium, the immediacy of drawing offers, as it always has, a profound mirror to the swift change that pervades the global digital culture. The author invites all those involved in drawing, in whatever form, to be a part of this dialogue.

Interactive Simulation System
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Simulation has gained significant importance as an analysis tool for construction operations over the past two decades. Since the development of CYCLONE by D.W. Halpin (1976), construction simulation has been improved along with computer technology. Although simulation is a powerful and effective tool in analyzing and improving construction operations, its usage in the construction industry has been limited. Construction simulation requires a user to have a thorough understanding of simulation methodology, which requires technical training and experience to grasp the knowledge needed for it. This research introduces the Interactive Simulation System, which provides an environment for users who are not familiar with running simulation programs. In order to improve the accessibility and the usability of construction simulation programs, the Interactive Simulation System adopts Internet technology and the standard model concept from MicroCYCLONE, which provides user-friendly input and output environments through World Wide Web.

In this paper, we discuss the benefits of including shadows in virtual reality applications and we propose a solution to the problem of generating shadows for dynamic scenes. In order to achieve interactivity, we restrict the problem to the case of polyhedral objects and planar surfaces. We propose a new mode as an extension to VRML that automatically generates the shadow of the underlying polygonal model in user-defined surfaces.

Tessellation and contour extraction algorithms for rapid prototyping replication of 3D-/spl mu/CT reconstructions of cancellous bone
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
A set of algorithms has been developed and evaluated for 3D and 2 1/2 D rapid prototyping replication of 3D reconstructions of cancellous bone samples. The algorithms replicate a voxel map without any loss of fidelity, so as to increase the validity of the comparison of mechanical tests on the 3D reconstructed models with those predicted by finite element analyses. The evaluation is both in terms of algorithmic complexity and the resultant data set size. The former determines the feasibility of the conversion process, whereas the latter the potential success of the manufacturing process.

Urban Pilot: a dynamic mapping tool for personalizing the city through collective memory
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2001
Investigates the use of hand-held mobile devices as exploratory personalized tools for dynamic navigation of the cityscape that go beyond cartographic limitations and directory-type services. Unfortunately, existing devices and their applications do not fully address the impelling potential of real-time, interactive tools. Moreover, the volatile, unpredictable randomness of the city life and its ever-changing patterns are rarely captured by static navigational means. This study proposes a tool which encourages personalized experiences of cities by providing a dynamic information space that overlaps the city with individual users, both spatially and temporally.

A mixed reality system for building form and data representation
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
The development of a prototype mixed-reality system for 3D building forms and data visualisation is presented. The requirements are: (1) allow user interaction with an external view of one or more buildings simultaneously; (2) maintain user contact with his or her normal working environment; (3) support multi-user input for collaborative design discussions; (4) facilitate intuitive navigation of the internal spaces; and (5) present data relating to multiple design solutions. This paper proposes that only by combining the relative advantages of augmented and virtual reality are these achievable. The overall goal is to successfully distribute an application that is accessible through inexpensive hardware, amongst the workforce of an engineering consultancy, whilst supporting more advanced input/output mechanisms. The guiding aim is to support the design process and to facilitate communication amongst the project team and the construction client. The paper presents an overview of the system and highlights key issues raised during the development process.

As a pure academic exercise, Mitrea (1994) published a paper about Clifford wavelets. This is the more exhaustive approach to the subject, years before I published a paper completely unrelated about quaternion wavelets from a different point of view. I try to develop the idea of Mitrea a little more in terms of a "static" use of quaternion wavelets and also some of my own ideas related to its "dynamic" use.

Efficient simplification of polygonal surface models
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
We have proposed a new edge collapse simplification algorithm that can produce efficiently high quality approximations of closed manifold surface models. To reduce the number of triangular faces in a polygonal model, a sequence of edge collapses is performed and to choose the appropriate sequence of edge collapses, we have introduced a new error metric based on a quantity proportional to the volume of a tetrahedron. Our proposed algorithm is simple, fast and memory efficient and, can efficiently reduce very large polygonal surface models. Moreover, simplified models created using our method preserve the essential features of a model and compare favorably to many well-known published simplification techniques in terms of maximum geometric error and mean geometric error and bear high visual reliability even after significant simplification.

Rational Bezier curves provide flexibility in curve design. The goal of this paper is to perform error analysis of Farin's (1983, 1986) algorithm for the evaluation of these curves.

An improved scan-line algorithm for display of CSG models
Proceedings Fifth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2001
A scan-line algorithm uses a one-dimensional set operation instead of a depth comparison to find a visible surface of the object shape defined by constructive solid geometry (CSG). Interactive solid modelers employing a scan-line algorithm require considerable computing time in repeated construction and destruction of parts of the CSG object models during the design process. We discuss three steps to improve a scan-line algorithm to display the CSG models on a screen. First, changing the order of application of the partial procedures in the algorithm can improve the performance in the interactive modelers. Secondly, substituting set operations for simple manipulations of the elements in two kinds of lists reduces computing time. Finally, using the connection information at the adjoining facets drastically reduces the number of set operation executions.

The paper presents an interactive visualization tool, Archimedean Kaleidoscope (AK), aimed at supporting a learner's exploration of polyhedra. AK uses metamorphosis as a technique to help support the learner's mental construction of relationships among different polyhedra. AK uses the symmetric nature of the platonic solids as the foundation for exploring the way in which polyhedra are related. The high level of interactivity helps support the exploration of these relationships.

DARE: a multidimensional environment for visualizing large set of medical data
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
We deal with the problem of automatic visualization of a large set of medical data and propose a framework that addresses the involved issues. Our approach does not depend on the particular data under analysis and its aim is to produce a highly effective visual representation. Such objective is made possible by the consistency of a set of logic rules contained in a knowledge base. These rules express facts and relationships about the visual domain, the data domain, the mapping between both domains, and the perceptual domain. Our approach has been tested against a challenging set of data, i.e., the biomedical data coming from the Nefrology Center of the Civil hospital of Vigevano.

Topic Maps provide a bridge between the domains of knowledge representation and information management by building a structured semantic network above information resources. Our research at LIP6 aims at visualizing this semantic layer efficiently, which is a critical issue as Topic Maps may contain millions of elements. This paper is divided into two parts. First, we depict briefly basic Topic Maps concepts. Then, we discuss Topic Maps visualisation requirements and we study how existing visualisation techniques may be applied to Topic Maps representation. We conclude by giving a few directions that could lead to the "ultimate" Topic Map visualisation tool.

Enhancing graphical information system models with VRML
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Current CASE tools lack efficient techniques to visualise information system (IS) design repository. One important aspect in visualising graphical IS models is to preserve structure, which can have semantic value. Another key issue is to provide both focus and context in order to understand how detailed information relates to other design elements. The third aspect to consider is to trace between diagrams and other design documents. Our VRML implementation integrates different types of diagrams as a whole. We applied elision technique for decomposition of data flow diagrams (DFD) and added visible lines to link parts of DFD to entity-relation diagrams. In our laboratory experiment, we collected users' subjective opinions and performance in information search tasks. Based on the promising results, we give suggestions for further exploration.

This paper presents an e-commerce tool that extends the conventional online store with a new section called room planner, a web application which is embedded in the virtual store. It allows the specification of the geometry of the room, placement of the objects and selection of the point of view. Then a realistic picture of the scene can be obtained. This functionality is very suitable for the furniture and ceramics sectors. In order to generate the images a parallel radiosity illumination algorithm has been implemented, which can be used in low-cost platforms such as a cluster of PCs, so that these technologies are affordable also for SMEs.

This paper reports results from a project that combined the visualisation of streetscapes with environmental economics. The particular economic methodology employed was choice experimentation, which has previously tended to use text to convey scenarios between which respondents make choices. The research investigated how the visual impact Of streetscapes could be incorporated in choice experiments through the use of 3D computer generated visualisations. Data was gathered initially through an Internet based survey, and replicated later using a high specification stand-alone machine. This paper identifies strengths and weaknesses in the approach, and reports results pertaining to effectiveness and practicality of the methodology. Using visualisation offers many potential benefits to the field of choice experimentation, and application within the built environment merits further development.

Virtual sculpting and deformable volume modelling
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Volume modeling techniques are capable of modeling objects with possible change in topology and is widely used in virtual sculpting. A common practice is to provide shape-editing tools for adding or removing material from a volume model. Generating a solid mesh from a volume model is a time consuming process. A modification in the volume data will require a solid mesh to be regenerated for the deformation process. In this paper, the boundary element approach is adopted. Since the deformation is computed based on the iso-surface of the volume data, this eliminates the need for generating solid mesh from the volume data. By converting the deformed mesh to volume data, a deformed volume model can be further manipulated with existing volume modelling techniques.

Distortion for readability of contextualized text explanations for visualizations
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Dual-Use of Image Space (DUIS) is a new technique for presenting text explanations for images within image space. This, however presents the problem of readability of the text since readers are used to reading from rectangular windows, on the other hand, a graphical object will typically have a silhouette of an irregular shape. To improve the readability we have developed a technique called rectangularization, i.e. on users' request the selected object morphs into a rectangular window. In order to preserve the context for the rectangularized object, as the selected object morphs into a rectangle, the other objects in the scene also change shape to create room for the newly created rectangle. On top of discussing the rectangularization concept, this paper discusses the algorithm used to displace the other objects in the scene. We also show the extension of the algorithms to allow for multiple rectangularization.

Explain me visually: exploring information design through multimedia
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
To convey a complex piece of information, we often use devices such as maps, graphs, and charts. Edward Tufte (1983), in his book Visual Display of Quantitative Information, points out that these devices help us convey information with multiple dimensions. Tufte holds that to convey a complex piece of information, one needs to break away from the analogies of reality and to maintain distance from illusionary representations of objects. This research project aims at analyzing visual communication devices such as maps, charts, graphs, and dance notations that are abstract in nature. Through an interactive multimedia program, the project helps users explore individual concepts as well as their relevance to one another. The content of this multimedia program is structured to better assist users to explore relationships between the concepts mentioned above and to form their own connections in the process.

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems such as Usenet newsgroups, e-mail lists, online chats, etc. facilitate large-scale human interactions and produce large sets of activity records. These datasets can be used to analyze and visualize the social networks existing at the online forums. Such analyses often improve our understanding of online inter-personal interactions, as well as lead to better designs and implementations of CMC systems. We report in this paper our experience in designing a newsgroup browser based on ideas from social network analysis. Our analyzer identifies reciprocal sub-groups in newsgroup discussions, and utilizes visual methods to help users look for leading authors and provocative articles. This is especially helpful for latecomers to catch up and participate in popular and noisy newsgroups.

Application of Catmull-Clark subdivision method in plastic injection mould parting surface design
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Automation of the various tasks of the plastic injection mould design process has attracted a lot of attention. Techniques for the automatic selection of parting direction, determination of the complex 3D parting line and the generation of parting surface have been reported. A common strategy in parting surface generation is the method of extrusion. Our investigation reveals that this method fails under certain conditions, which results in intersection between the parting surface patch and the part surface, and inter-locking between the mould halves. To solve these problems, a new method based on the subdivision method of surface generation is proposed. A variation of the Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme is employed which ensures that the resulting surface interpolates the main parting line of the part. The initial control mesh used in the subdivision process is obtained by "projecting" the 2D medial axis of an approximating polygon to 3D. An experimental program has been implemented to verify the feasibility of the method.

Ideally, freshman level students entering technology and engineering programs should possess an innate or intuitive understanding of the relationship between interacting physical objects and the mathematical and graphical fundamentals that describe that interaction. Developing and refining an understanding of that relationship is an important foundational preparation for students preparing for occupations in these fields. Historically, the development of that process has been accomplished predominantly through numerical mathematical means that often necessitate presenting important principles to students as numerical or nonvisual abstractions. The objective of this paper is to describe initial efforts to develop highly graphical visual, spatial, audile, motion-based methods which address a vital emerging goal in applied computer graphics instruction; problem solving through 3D computer graphic design-simulation.

Designing screen-based interfaces for advanced multimedia functionality
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
This paper examines the intersection of relevant design principles and activities, and the process for understanding and developing interfaces for the context of screen-based multimedia. The process is based on a synthesis of cognitive psychology, human computer interaction, and industrial design principles germane to designing screen-based interfaces. This interdisciplinary approach has proven useful in building a framework for understanding and leaching screen-based interface design. The intended outcome of this research is to present new directions to teaching and designing screen-based interfaces, in order to define a context for growth in professional education, and improve the user experience. As screen-based interfaces require the interaction of a user, a foundation of guiding principles from human computer interaction and the cognitive sciences must be integrated into the visual communication designer range of expertise. By applying this interdisciplinary convergence into the design process of screen-based interfaces, we believe our students are equipped with a better understanding of the interaction process between users and screen-based interfaces. Our results of teaching are illustrated through a variety of screen-based interface solutions. Each solution was structured by applying this interdisciplinary design process that synthesizes functional importance, cognitive understanding, and visual interest.

Spring embedder preprocessing for WWW visualization
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
We present a preprocessor for the spring embedder graph drawing method and show its use in speeding up the automatic layout of three-dimensional visualizations of WWW sites. Spring embedding is a widely used method for visualizing the connections in WWW maps, as it can typically produce a reasonable layout for most general graphs. However, the technique does not scale well and to improve the performance when dealing with large graphs various optimisations have been developed. Our preprocessor is a new optimization method that attempts to obtain a reasonably good initial drawing to be then used by the spring embedder. This initial drawing has edge lengths that are approximately equal along with a minimum node separation. This produces a layout that is closer to the final drawing than a random scattering of nodes and so allows fewer invocations of the spring embedder to produce an equally stable drawing.

A diagrammatic technique utilising a dataflow metaphor is used to express different kinds of spatial and non-spatial constraints. Basic filters are designed to represent the various types of queries in such systems. Icons for different types of spatial relations are used to denote the filters. Different granularities of the relations are presented in a hierarchical fashion when selecting the spatial constraints. The language constructs are presented and examples are used to demonstrate the expressiveness of the approach in representing different kinds of queries, including spatial joins and composite spatial queries. The implementation prototype of the language is also described and its features evaluated against a general purpose GIS package.

Jigsaw-puzzle-like 3D diagrams to represent syntactical constraints
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Three-dimensional diagrams composed of jigsaw-puzzle-like glyphs are proposed for representing syntactical constraints. The 3D glyphs have convex and concave shapes that give visual representation to the constraints. A production rule of grammar is represented by a stretchable board shape. A syntactical structure is represented by a nested board shape; and a syntactical constraint is represented by an inclusive match between the convex shape of one board and the concave shape of another. A generation method of jigsaw-puzzle-like 3D glyphs for context-free grammar is proposed and described.

Visualizing and exploring large networked information spaces with matrix browser
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
This paper presents a new approach for visualizing and exploring large networked information structures which may represent, for instance, linked information resources or metadata structures such as ontologies. An interactive matrix display is used for showing relations between concepts and concept hierarchies displayed along the two axes of a matrix. The new approach also focuses on the engineering process to create these information networks. Initial user testing shows performance advantages as well as reduced visual search in comparison to conventional graph representations.

3D character modeling in virtual reality
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
The paper presents a virtual reality modeling system based on interactive web technologies. The system's goal is to provide a user-friendly virtual environment for the development of 3D characters with an articulated structure. The interface allows the modeling of both the character's joint structure (the hierarchy) and its segment geometry (the skin). The novelty of the system consists of (1) the combination of web technologies used (VRML, Java and EAI) which provides the possibility of online modeling, (2) rules and constraints based operations and thus interface elements, (3) vertices and sets of vertices used as graphics primitives and (4) the possibility to handle and extend hierarchies based on the H-anim structure elements.

Visual exploration of communication in command and control
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Communication is a central activity in command and control. However, analysing communication using linear transcription of large amounts of sequential data is tedious and time consuming. This paper describes an alternative approach for communication analysis based on visual exploration of abstract representations of communication. It introduces a visualisation technique based on the Attribute Explorer. The technique was implemented in a visualisation component embedded in a framework for coordinated presentation of temporal data. It is demonstrated using authentic communication data from a military exercise and a rescue operation.

Exploring interaction strategies with Wall-screen: a new dual-display device for managing collections of web pages
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Wall-screen is a heterogeneous dual-headed display combining (1) a wall-size augmented surface to display peripheral information and (2) a common screen to focus on specific tasks. Wall-screen has been used for tasks related to the management of collections of web pages ranging from authoring new web pages to browsing, organizing or retrieving pages from existing collections. This specific application is used to illustrate the benefits of Wall-screen device but we believe that our model is generic enough to be used in many other areas where (1) a user needs to shift from his main focus to related peripheral information relatively frequently, (2) peripheral information might be organized, discussed, and shared among several users and (3) focus and periphery can be divided into two independent spaces with no additional cognitive load for the user. In this paper we present Wall-screen basics, we propose three different design strategies that determine: (1) how to manipulate information on the wall and (2) how to organize the space between the two display devices. Further we present preliminary evaluation and lessons learned.

A fast recognition system for isolated arabic characters
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
This paper presents a very fast multi-stage algorithm for the recognition of non-Latin script. Although the examples use Arabic script, the system could be adapted in minutes to deal with any character set, in particular non-Latin characters where no commercial OCR systems are available. The approach used normalises isolated characters for size and extracts an image signature based on the number of black pixels in the rows and columns of the character and compares these values to a set of signatures for typical characters of the set. This technique identifies not only the closet match but gives the closeness of match to all other characters in the set, which is expressed in a triangular confusion matrix.

A novel algorithm on computing intersections of two surfaces of revolution based on spherical decomposition
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
A novel algorithm for computing RSIC intersection curves of two surfaces of revolution is presented; it subdivides a surface of revolution into a collection of coaxial spherical strips, by subdividing its generatrix into a collection of C/sup 0/ and C/sup 1/ coaxial circular arcs correspondingly. So the intersection problem of two surfaces of revolution is reduced to an intersection problem of two spherical stripes, and RSIC is approximated as a piecewise C/sup 0/ and C/sup 1/ circular, which is quite convenient for some CAD applications. Cylindrical bounding shell is used for computing valid intersection interval VII to avoid the unnecessary intersection computation efficiently. Finally, we give a simple algorithm of tracing RSIC for classification and a unified rational Bezier representation to RSIC.

Multiple views in 3D metaphoric information visualization
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
In exploring large volumes of information, more often than not, one single visualization is not sufficient for grasping the whole data set. This may be due to different reasons: the screen real-estate is limited, the user's capacity for comprehending a large data set also has limits, different views or perspectives of the same data may be needed to grasp all the details, and so on. Multiple visualizations allow the user to explore large amounts of complex information more easily and rapidly We believe that one of the strengths of 3D metaphoric information visualization will emerge from the combined use of several interacting tools, each potentially depicting different views of the information. This paper presents work done on using multiple views for the visualization of abstract information via metaphoric representations.

Histomorphometric algorithms for the direct derivation of morphological indices of simulations of strain-adaptation in cancellous bone
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
A set of algorithms has been developed and applied, in order to quantify the morphology of structures produced by our work on computer simulation of cancellous bone remodelling. The set of algorithms is organised in three themes, based on the set of metrics they compute. The first one deals with the direct derivation of basic metrics such as the trabecular thickness, separation and number. The second deals with the area/volume distribution of bone and marrow, while the third one considers surface roughness and perimeter/area. The algorithms were tested on sample sections of cancellous bone and applied to a simulation of strain adaptation incorporating complex multi-axial loading. The metrics have shown to be independent of structural anisotropy, in contrast to some established methods that assume certain morphologies.

Tracking knowledge of emergent domains
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Knowledge is communicated through the so-called semiotic systems: written text, images, mathematical and chemical symbols, and so on. The knowledge of emergent domains is yet to standardize its symbol systems which simply adds to the (creative) chaos inherent in such emergent systems. The analysis of change in written text, amongst the most changeable semiotic system at the lexical level at least, may reveal a consensus in the use of terms. Terms denote concepts and textually help us to understand how knowledge evolves in an emergent domain. The emergent domain of semiconductor physics, specifically nano-structured tunnel diodes, is studied as an exemplar. This is our attempt to establish a method, which covers a broad range of texts, journal articles, patent documents and state-of-the-art review papers, to observe the emergence of a new domain. In each of the four knowledge conversion phases a domain community appears to prefer certain lexical items and uses an appropriate text type.

In this paper we present an innovative approach to visualize people's personal information. The approach is based on the assumption that a personal environment, furnished by an interested and engaged person, expresses more about himself than a simple text or even an image or fixed animation. We consider this personalized living environment as innovative form of a Resume, created with the intention of giving a possible employer a good impression about both: hard facts and soft skills of the applicant. We describe a client-server-based system, which allows professionals to create their own personalized 3D Homepage as their Resume.

The suitability of the Java language for computer-graphics and visualisation research
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
The potential and the limitations of the Java language for graphics and visualisation research are evaluated. Evidence is offered that Java is adequate for high-performance computing and still has the added benefit of the portability of its compiled byte code over a wide range of platforms. It is demonstrated that, contrary to popular belief, there is an efficient way for reading and writing individual pixels. It is also demonstrated that graphics primitives can be drawn in one memory access per pixel even without pointer arithmetics. Just-in-time and hot-spot compiler technologies considerably improve the speed of the executable code, though some penalty remains for dynamic binding. Some inconsistencies and flaws in the design and implementations of the Java class libraries are noted. In general, however, Java offers both portability and adequate performance of the executable code, and also increased productivity due to its extensive class libraries, therefore it should be a serious consideration for researchers, developers and educators in graphics and visualisation.

Do four eyes see better than two? Collaborative versus individual discovery in data visualization systems
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
We present an empirical study investigating collaborative and individual decision-making about data using two different information visualization systems. Based on previous research, one system is considered more transparent than the other in terms of visual representation and functionality. We found that people who worked in groups were more correct in their answers for objective questions, based on searching a large dataset. These results held for the more transparent system, but not the less transparent system. In a second task, groups were more accurate in their results for a free data discovery task. Again, these results held for the more transparent system only. Subjects using this system also produced results that were higher in complexity but judged lower in importance. Groups and individuals did not differ. We suggest that given the right visualization system, groups do better than individuals in finding more accurate results, but not necessarily increased or more meaningful results.

In the development of a digital sculpture for a competition entry, a mathematical approach was investigated as a method to develop a variety of forms. This paper covers the initial inspiration for the sculpture, Georg Nees's Gravel Stones, and then the series of approaches that were developed expanding the starting concept. Each step in the process is described including the decisions and alternatives that were explored. The sculpture was entirely built and developed with custom software using a series of related mathematical concepts. The software and related digital representations became the sculpting material and the sculpting tools.

This study attempts to apply the principle of neural networks and pattern recognition (PR) technologies to real-time recognition by client-server network structure into a web-based recognizing system. In this paper, we recommend a Web-Based PR technology, which is improved recurrent neural network (RNN) from possessing feedback and non-linear activation function with its input, be taken out threshold. The purpose of this article is. to construct a Client-Server network structure for PR system with associative memory. The Server-end is built a databases management system for storage sample patterns. In proceed with training, the user can real-time assign any pattern, which is a record in the Server-end databases. In deal with retrieve task, we propose a novel PR method via databases matching, it can efficient solve spurious states problem from RNN in the WBPR system. On the other hand, taking advantage of Database Matching is to overcome the capacity restrictions on RNN. In order to clarify and corroborate the above Web-Based PR technology, thus a simulation experiment will be presented and their algorithms are also discussed.

Fillets: cues for connections in Focus+Context views of graph-like diagrams
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
We apply fillets - smoothing of sharp angles at the joints - between the connections and nodes of graph-like diagrams. In situations where the graph layout is constrained, e.g. Focus+Context views or views where the coordinates of the nodes are informative, fillets can clarify the relationships considerably without altering the layout. A visual search experiment supports our hypothesis that with fillets it is considerably easier to perceive node-connection structures. We discuss algorithms with different tradeoffs for flexibility and performance for rendering these connections in a single pass using OpenGL.

Using bibliometric maps to visualise term distribution in scientific papers
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
Bibliometric maps are scaled representations of clusters of papers and provide an overview of a scientific field as provided by those papers and the references between them. We have enhanced our interactive bibliometric explorer (iBEX) to visualise the distribution of phrases over such bibliometric maps. Assuming that generic (non-content-bearing) phrases occur in most of the papers in the map, those phrases confined to a specific part of the map will probably be more content-bearing than those distributed all over the map. Such knowledge can eventually be used to evaluate a selection of words and phrases.

Applying Gestalt principles to animated visualizations of network data
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Graphs are a commonly used data structure for representing relational information. Drawings of these structures, as node and link diagrams, can provide a useful visualization of the underlying abstract data. This makes drawings of graphs a useful tool in information visualization. Indeed graph drawing has been applied in many application areas including software engineering, knowledge management and for depicting communication networks. The spatial layout can help the user build up a cognitive model or 'mental map' of the information structure. Many automatic algorithms for producing drawings of a graph have been implemented. In many domains it is also common for the underlying information to be dynamic and this means the graph drawing must be updated. Unfortunately, even small changes to the underlying data can result in dramatic changes to the final drawing and this means the user may totally lose their previous 'mental map'. Animation between the two versions of the layout is one approach that can assist the user to make the transition between the two drawings. We have been examining how to apply the Gestalt principles of organisation to this animation phase. The aim is to assist the user in understanding the structural and visual changes that have occurred in the layout. Results of that work are described with relevant examples.

Sound glyphs representing inheritance relationships
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
An auralization technique for representing inheritance relationships in an object-oriented programming language is proposed. The inheritance relationships are represented by inclusion relationships of sound passages, which are called sound glyphs. A prototype system using this technique can assign unique sound glyphs to all classes in Java 2 standard edition version 1.2.2 whose class library has more than 1,500 classes and constitutes a practical class hierarchy. Experiments with three types of sound glyphs were conducted, in which accuracy with one type of sound glyph of about 71 % was obtained, a level more than twice that expected for random answers. This shows that sound glyphs can help one to recognize relationships among classes. Since a sound glyph is transient, we need to use not only the sound glyph but also textual representation in order to understand the meaning of a class. Sound glyphs can be used with visual representations because they have different modalities. The features of sound glyphs are discussed.

2002
This paper reports work in progress on the analysis and visualization of the spatial and temporal distribution of user interaction data collected in three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds. Two tools are introduced. The "WorldMapper" reads in a so-called propdump file and creates a 2D clickable map showing the layout of the world as well as interaction possibilities such as teleports and clickable web links. The second tool visualizes user interaction data such as navigation, chatting, and Web access activity overlaid on the world map. Resulting visualizations are meant to support social navigation, design evaluation and optimization, and the study of virtual communities. Both tools are demonstrated on a 19-person information treasure hunt for information in a 3D virtual world. The paper concludes with a discussion and an outlook.

Visualizing spatially varying distribution data
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
Box plot is a compact representation that encodes the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and quartile information of a distribution. In practice, a single box plot is drawn for each variable of interest. With the advent of more accessible computing power, we are now facing the problem of visualizing data where there is a distribution at each 2D spatial location. Simply extending the box plot technique to distributions over 2D domain is not straightforward. One challenge is reducing the visual clutter if a box plot is drawn over each grid location in the 2D domain. This paper presents and discusses two general approaches, using parametric statistics and shape descriptors, to present 2D distribution data sets. Both approaches provide additional insights compared to the traditional box plot technique.

A visualization system of relationships among papers based on the graph drawing problem
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
This study developed a support system that can retrieve papers by using the paper-relationship diagrams (PRDs) that express the relationships among papers. The system has the following functions: (1) users can see various relationships among papers by visualizing of PRDs; and (2) the visualization patterns can be changed dynamically by users own point of view. To implement the dynamic and safe visualization of the PRDs, the authors formalized user requirements for visualization as a set of constraints on the graph drawing problem, and developed an algorithm that visualizes the PRDs based on the graph drawing problem. By the implementation of the dynamic and safe visualization of the PRDs, users can see various relationships among papers by changing their own point of view.

Integrating learning and visualization technologies in orthopaedics establishing the Virtual Orthopaedic European University
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Digital technologies offer a working environment for familiarisation with new surgical procedures and management of clinical case audit. To enhance access and control of these virtual workspaces an eXtensible Mark-up Language (XML) based interface has been developed. This links the educational environment of the Web based training (WBT) scheme to the clinical data collection from ongoing trials in Orthopaedics. The Virtual Orthopaedic European University (VOEU) infrastructure encompasses the normal working environment of engineers and clinicians using computer assisted surgery tools adopting dedicated interactive media. The XML based interface enables users to communicate using material mediated for their specific needs allowing adaptive media based upon user experience and knowledge base. This combines declarative (factual) content with feedback from a clinical (procedural) case-based training and evaluation environment. By using the XML interface, we were able to cater for the different user hardware and software resources, media content and language of presentation, and incorporate virtual environment simulations. By constructing a framework based upon already established standards, we anticipate the applicability to other surgical disciplines. This will enable the development of networking computer architectures to assist the assimilation of multiple sources and media.

A successful data collection visualization should satisfy conflicting requirements: unification of diverse data formats, support for serendipity research, support of hierarchical structures, algorithmizability, vast information density, Internet-readiness, etc. The traditional 2D representations of metabolic pathways lack compactness and information density. Virtual reality (VR) has made significant progress in engineering, architectural design, entertainment and communication. Evident advantages of using VR for scientific visualization are subconscious orientation, compromise between overview and detail, memorizing search results, and customization. We experiment with the possibility of using immersive abstract 3D visualizations of metabolic networks. We present the trial Metabolic Network Visualizer (MNV) software, which produces graphical representation of a metabolic network as a VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) world.

A boundary representation and comparison technique for two-dimensional objects
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
A novel method is provided for the representation and comparison of boundaries of two-dimensional objects. The work builds upon the rotating squares algorithm of Donafee and Maple (2000), a method based upon the marching cubes algorithm of Lorensen and Cline (1987). The rotating squares method for representing and comparing the boundaries of two-dimensional objects differs from standard polygonal approximations of objects in the sense that, though more space is required for data storage, there is no loss of data as is the case with approximations. This work presents a new method for polygonal approximation and details of a hybrid method whereby polygonal approximations are used for initial boundary comparisons and then the exact data is used for further investigation.

Visual navigation of distributed knowledge structures in groupware-based organizational memories
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Many of today's organizations already have a strong integration of groupware systems in their IT-infrastructure. The shared databases of these groupware systems form organizational memories, which comprise the complete knowledge of an organization collected over the time of its existence. One key problem is how to find relevant knowledge in continuously growing and distributed organizational memories. The basic functionalities and mechanisms in groupware systems are not sufficient to support users in finding required knowledge. Topic maps provide strong paradigms and concepts for the semantic structuring of link networks and therefore, they are a considerable solution for organizing and navigating large and continuously growing organizational memories. The K-Discovery project suggests applying topic maps to groupware-based organizational memories to create knowledge structures and address the mentioned challenges. Visual navigation capabilities to exploit the created knowledge structures are based on hyperbolic geometry concepts and provide users with intuitive access mechanisms to the required knowledge.

2002
In this paper we present DESK, an authoring tool for the automatic customisation of the front-end of web applications as a result of changes that users perform in dynamically generated HTML pages. Our authoring tool uses domain knowledge and presentation knowledge stored in PEGASUS, an automatic web page generation system for rendering ontology-driven knowledge.

Compact hierarchical image descriptors
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
An efficient approach for image annotation and retrieval is presented. The main objective is to overcome the speed limitations of existing video indexing and retrieval systems. A family of successively simplified image descriptors is defined using colour histograms. The colour distribution is quantised according to a scale-parameter obtained by convolving the distribution function with Gaussians of increasing size. The generated family of histograms is then used to define descriptors at various levels of detail. Using this hierarchical descriptor structure large sets of non-similar images are discriminated at very low computational cost using low detailed descriptions. The search is then refined progressively until only a few very similar objects or images are found and ranked using higher levels of detail. To compare image descriptors the earth mover's distance is used. Experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the proposed technique.

2002
IVPrototype is an information visualization prototype for the visualization of both geometrical and non-geometrical data. Our goal is to provide a generic system that automatically generates data visualization and dynamically adapts the interface according to the data in order to control the amount of information displayed. The information is organized in one or several information groups, which aggregate semantically related information. Icons and coloured surfaces are the visual mappings provided. Other features of this prototype are: a data independent architecture; several filtering mechanisms; use of degree of interest functions; automatic selection of icons based on scale factor and semantic criteria.

Computer aided chair design system using form features
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
This paper deals with "computer aided chair design system" based on form features of chair elements that constructs the 3D product model of a chair from a sketch drawn by a designer. In design processes of a chair a designer usually wants to express his/her idea of the form and structure of a chair by drawing sketches because sketching is one of the most desired manners for expressing designer idea. Besides, CAD data of a chair are essential in its manufacturing processes. In this study, a system is proposed to construct the 3D CAD data of a chair by arranging the form features of chair elements with fitting them on a-sketch. The system enables designers to easily make the 3D chair models from their idea sketches and to evaluate the design-form by figures from the various visual angles.

An incremental algorithm to support geometric constraint satisfaction in engineering design
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
This paper presents a set of algorithms to efficiently support geometric constraint satisfaction during engineering design. Based upon an incremental graph construction approach, these algorithms satisfy each new inserted constraint by exploiting the degrees of freedom of the involved geometric entities. The objective is to avoid satisfying the entire constraint set from scratch due to a new constraint insertion. A prototype system has been developed and is presented to demonstrate the flexibility gained by the proposed incremental algorithms.

On the notion of compliance in critiquing intelligent design assistants: representing duty and contrary-to-duty statements
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
This paper is part of an investigation into formal and operational models of the notion of compliance between a design and a body of regulatory design knowledge. Design compliance is defined here on the basis of database integrity. The paper provides a formal model of design compliance, based on the assumption that designs are representable as Horn clauses with negation in the body and design rules are representable as denials in first order logic (FOL). This model has been implemented in aiDA, a prototype of a critiquing intelligent design assistant developed for this research. Unfortunately, FOL does not provide adequate representational support for all the statement structures that occur in real bodies of regulatory design knowledge. Some statements require different logic forms and, for these, the definition of compliance has to be reconsidered. This paper presents a motivation for formalising design regulations, an overview of what has so far been done by using first order logic, and a new extension of the mechanism to duty and contrary-to-duty statements. The results draw on results in database systems and normative reasoning.

Using motion analysis techniques for motion retargeting
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
This paper proposes a new approach for motion retargeting, i.e., adjusting motion-capture data to different characters and scenes. For achieving universality, the existing retargeting techniques often become absolutely impractical for most of real-life applications. In contrast, we did not try to create a technique that can deal with practically any motion, but concentrated on creating a practical solution that is able to produce realistic results for a some subset of all motions. So, the corner-stone idea of our approach is that realistic retargeting can only be achieved if the algorithm is aware about the structure and specific features of the processed motion. We applied this idea to animation of human locomotion and developed a motion-analysis algorithm that can identify type/structure of the motion and extract a lot of useful information, such as gait phases, foot-ground constraints, important features that should be preserved during retargeting, etc. Also, we developed an inverse kinematics-based retargeting solver that can take advantage of using this information and can produce accurate and realistic animations of human locomotion.

Visualisation of perturbed vowel phonation using dynamic fundamental harmonic normalisation
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
In larynx cancer patients the monitoring of vocal fold behaviour can be achieved using glottal waveforms for vowels captured as trans-larynx impedance time series via an electro-laryngograph. The impedance signals are sustained for up to 4 seconds, digitised at 20 kHz, and divided into 1000 point frames. An estimate of the instantaneous power spectral density PSD is computed from of each frame. However, detailed spectral differences between normal and aberrant vowel phonation are obscured by dynamic variations in fundamental frequency f/sub 0/. To separate fundamental and harmonic behaviour, f/sub 0/ is extracted from a frame and used to normalise spectral powers and to transform the entire frequency range into floating point multiples of the fundamental frequency. FHN dynamic PSD can then be presented as shaded surfaces to the clinician for evaluation. Examples are given for normal volunteers and a patient assessed by speech and language therapists pre-treatment, then at 6 and 12 months post treatment.

2002
Website maps are becoming one of the most important applications of graph drawing and information visualization techniques. However, the user has often struggled with web graphs returned from web search agents. To efficiently manage the visualization of these graphs it also occurs to take advantage from the flexibility of XML language. GraphXML format is a standard proposed for the information visualization of generic graphs. In this work, we focus on query graphs in. the sense of web graphs that are the semantics of WebSQL query language. In particular, we give a GraphXML description of query graphs in a way that visual properties like colouring scheme for node relevance visualization ("hot pages") can be included. As application we show some example of query maps returned by our web search tool VSEARCH that are obtained in an easy way via a Javascript view program.

A new animation approach for visualizing intelligent agent behaviours in a virtual environment
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Animated intelligent agents play an important role in dynamic virtual environments. They are able to perform behaviours based on internal states and external stimuli. Animation techniques are crucial to agent behaviour visualization in order to achieve effective interaction between agents and human users. This paper proposes a new animation procedure to visualise realistic intelligent agent behaviours. The animation system consists of three parts, namely synthetic vision, FzFSM with memory and an animation library that uses mesh skinning techniques. The agent is capable of exhibiting non-repetitive behaviours to reflect change from both its internal states and its environment. The system is implemented on a PC platform with modern 3D acceleration hardware. The result of this work can be applied to real time 3D graphics applications in the field of entertainment and multimedia.

Bibliometric mapping of science within a science policy context required a different approach to visualization than for IR purposes. The identification of sub-domains within a field and their unchanged definition over time is crucial. A combination of this structure with actor characteristics provides possible answers to policy related questions. A dedicated interface to enter a science map enables users to explore the field and its developments and to retrieve answers to user-defined questions from a policy perspective.

Bringing production work flow to a classroom teaching
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
It is every academic's dream that students can hold their place in the job market or in higher education. Furthermore, schools try their best to acquire equipment and human resources to help students excel. But there are many hurdles and constraints that have to be faced in an academic environment as compared to a production house. In order to get the maximum result, an instructor has to set parameters. These parameters are based on two things: Student's capabilities and their background; Resources at hand. Within the above parameters, I formed an expectation from each student. I had to have this expectation well defined because the students I was teaching had no knowledge of three-dimensional graphics at all. It was the first time they had experienced modeling, rendering, and animation, and it was the first time I had taught computer graphics. I created exercises based on design methodology that would separate ideation from the implementation process. This is important in any production related pipeline too. Regardless of required software and hardware capabilities, expectations were set in the beginning and were clear to both instructor and students. Consequently, at the end of the term both, educator and learners were satisfied with the result.

Information pyramids compactly visualise large hierarchical structures in three dimensions using pyramid-like structures, which grow upwards as the hierarchy deepens. A plateau represents the root of the tree; other, smaller plateaus arranged on top of it represent its subtrees. Separate glyphs are used to represent leaf nodes such as files or documents and navigational facilities are provided for interactive exploration. Two generations of information pyramids prototype are described and discussed.

On nearly symmetric drawings of graphs
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
We propose a force-directed approach for drawing graphs in a nearly symmetric fashion. Our algorithm is built upon recent theoretical results on maximum symmetric subgraphs. Knowing the sequence of edge contractions sufficient for turning an asymmetric graph into a symmetric subgraph, our approach to symmetric drawing begins by drawing a graph's maximum symmetric subgraph using a force-directed method; the contracted edges are then re-inserted back into the drawing. By considering symmetry as the underlying aesthetic criterion, our algorithm provides better drawings than conventional spring algorithms, as our experimental results indicate.

Towards a visual interface for information visualization
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Information visualization, aided by ever more accessible computational resources, continues to grow in popularity and significance. The capability to generate complex imagery by computer is often necessary but not always sufficient to gain the desired insight. The success of a visual representation in a given context may be affected by many variables, not the least of which is the individual user's experience. Even if a precise relationship could be found between context and "best" visual representation, the complete articulation of a context is practically impossible. In other fields, this is known as sensitive dependence to initial conditions. A more feasible alternative is to begin with an incomplete articulation of a context and allow the user to interactively develop and refine it. Although most computer interfaces for information visualization tools are predominantly verbal, a predominantly visual interface can have significant advantages. Such an interface allows users to avoid the usual translations between visual and verbal modes and it removes users' need for a specialized visualization vocabulary. A visual interface can also shift the focus of the visualization process from the data towards the user These ideas are discussed in the context of a prototype tool, the design of which is illustrated with an example, and the evaluation of which has provided many positive results.

Since the chalk was brought into education in the XIX century, the use of communication technology has been the most impressive change in this field. We are aware of the need of forming team works and giving a new direction to education in order to improve the communication between teachers and students of Architecture, Engineering and Construction. We make use of the following concepts: constructivist learning, virtual classroom, virtual simulation laboratory, Internet, team work, cooperative work (such as digital and electronic cooperative spaces). We also refer to a synchronous/asynchronous communication group, which offers cooperative approaches for teaching and training.

Cooperative robot teleoperation through virtual reality interfaces

Robots are employed to do exacting routines, ranging from the common place to the difficult and from the relatively safe to the highly dangerous. Remote-controlled robots-or teleoperation-is one way to combine the intelligence and maneuverability of human beings with the precision and durability of robots. Teleoperation can be difficult, due to the complexity both of the system and of information management-and more difficult still in a cooperative environment in which multiple teams are working together in different locations. To facilitate teleoperation, information visualization and a clear communication reference must be deployed in conjunction with an enhanced human machine interface (HMI) among all participating teams. The aim of this paper is to present a set of guidelines defining an ideal user interface utilizing virtual reality desktop for collaborative robot teleoperation in unknown environments. Enhancements in information visualization are discussed, and the case of an underwater robot is presented, because of the special challenges they present: a slow response system and six degrees of movement.

In the 21/sup st/ century, literacy meant the ability to read, write and present cogent arguments on paper. In the 21/sup st/ century, literacy is going to extend well beyond that and into what could be termed as a language of screens. This paper provides an overview of University of Southern California's (USC's) pedagogical strategies and theoretical precepts of an innovative educational initiative. Currently, in its fourth year, USC's multimedia literacy program is dedicated to clarifying and expanding definitions of 21/sup st/ Century by introducing multimedia technology - coupled with a critical awareness of visual culture - into higher education curricula. The program is fundamentally interdisciplinary, adapting the theories and methodology of cinema, television and new media studies to address the specific needs and culturally relevant issues of academic departments in the humanities, fine arts, social sciences and physical sciences alike. At the heart of the program is a unique emphasis on multimedia authorship which compels both students and faculty to undertake their own multimedia projects.

Designing dynamic interactive visualisations to support collaboration and cognition
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
Dynamic interactive visualisations (DIVs) are intended to help coordination and collaboration, through augmenting existing forms of synchronous communication (i.e. phones, face to face, walkie-talkie). A central feature of a DIV is active user involvement: users are required to create, annotate, and change the information visualisation to represent the changes in the activity space they are concerned with. One benefit of doing so is to enable users to externalise and offload some of the cognitive effort involved. in problem-solving, by laying out information in ways that can help them derive a solution and know what to do next. In this paper we describe how we went about designing a DIV to support nomadic team working. We begin by describing our experimentation in designing a DIV. We then show how our computer-based DIV substantially, improved performance for a complex collaborative task, which involved much communication and cognition.

Multiform glyph based web search result visualization
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Searching for information on the web is hard; the user may not know what they are looking for, they may refine their search from information gathered by preliminary naive searches, and they may be looking for luminous sites that have many external links so that they can browse further. Information visualization can aid the user in many of these search related tasks. Certainly, the user is familiar with browsing and manipulating the search results through textual style interfaces, but they would gain a better understanding of the information through different presentation methods. Thus, we believe rank ordered lists should be used along-side abstract information visualization presentations. We present a system that displays multiple views of search result information. It provides views for displaying abstract visualization designs using multiform glyphs as well as a ranked text based list. Our engine also retrieves detailed information about the located sites (such as size of page, and quantities of internal and external links); and we describe two glyph designs that display this rich information.

Numerical solving of geometric constraints
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
In computer-aided design, geometric modeling by constraints enables users to describe shapes by relationships, called constraints between geometric elements. The problem is to derive automatically these geometric elements. Many resolution methods have been proposed for solving systems of geometric constraints. Geometric methods can be very efficient but are only applicable to particular kinds of problems (typically rule and compass constructive problems). Some schemes cannot be solved by any geometric method. A numerical method is then necessary. We use the bisection method to solve these "difficult" cases. The bisection method enables users to reliably find all solutions to a system of nonlinear equations within a region defined by bounds on each individual coordinate of the geometric objects.

The Virtual Articulator - applying VR technologies to dentistry
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
The use of virtual reality (VR) techniques for computer-aided diagnosis is revolutionizing the medical routing in various medical disciplines. Especially in the field of dentistry VR in combination with CAD/CAM technologies offers a high potential for implant planning/design resulting in a higher accuracy and a shorter therapy time period. The geometry of the teeth is recognisable and digitisable using an intraoral camera, the implant models can be designed with specialized CAD systems and the final implants are generated using a CNC machine. In this context the "Virtual Articulator" (VA) completes the digital manufacturing pipeline and offers the possibility to consider patient-specific jaw biomechanics in the implant generation process. The objective of this project is the development of a system for dental occlusion diagnosis. For this important diagnosis in today's dental routine the mechanical articulator is used. The VA simulates and augments the functionalities of the mechanical articulator. Therefore it takes a digital 3-D representation of the jaws as input data, generates a simulation of the jaw movements, and delivers a dynamical visualization of the occlusion points. The high technical demands to the system are given through the high accuracy necessary for dental applications and the large models that have to be handled in the system.

This paper reports on a pragmatic, project-based exploration of the challenge of delivering web-based, navigable, 3D learning environments, which are constrained by demands for accurate detail and complex geometry. Specifically the project required the creation of a digital model of a 16th century ship. The project grew out of a collaboration started in 1998 between the Portsmouth School of Architecture, nine local junior schools, an educational authority and an archaeological trust. The project provided lessons in the creation of web-efficient models, techniques for combining familiar multimedia and 3-D modelling, with desktop virtual reality. It demonstrates the technical potential for sharing geometrically complex environments-over the web.

We propose using a constraint relational representation for spatial data derived using an inverse distance weighting interpolation method. The advantage of our approach is that many queries that could not be done in traditional GIS systems can now be easily expressed and evaluated in constraint database systems. The data visualization can also be based on constraint techniques.

Representing spatial information through multimodal interfaces
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
The research discussed is a component of a larger study to explore the accessibility and usability of spatial data presented through multiple sensory modalities including haptic, auditory and visual interfaces. Geographical information systems (GIS) and other computer-based tools for spatial display predominantly use vision to communicate information to the user, as sight is the spatial sense par excellence. Ongoing research is exploring the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary to navigate through multimodal interfaces, which are user, task, domain, and interface specific. This highlights the necessity for both a conceptual/theoretical schema, and the need for extensive usability studies. Preliminary results presented here exploring feature recognition, and shape tracing in non-visual environments indicate multimodal interfaces have a great deal of potential for facilitating access to spatial data for blind and visually impaired persons. The research is undertaken with the wider goals of increasing information accessibility and promoting "universal access.".

The empathic visualisation algorithm (EVA) - an automatic mapping from abstract data to naturalistic visual structure
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
This paper demonstrates a technique for visualising multidimensional data sets holistically. The EVA algorithm provides an automatic mapping from semantically important features of the data to emotionally or perceptually significant features of the corresponding visual structure (such as a face). In other words a single glance at the visual structure informs the observer of the global state of the data, since the visual structure has an emotional impact on the observer The visualisation is designed to correspond to the impact that would have been generated had the observer been able to access the relevant semantics of the underlying data.

Visualizing electronic mail
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
As the number of electronic messages continues to grow, information visualization tools become increasingly important to support users in the complexity of managing the large amount of information they receive. This paper presents a visualization approach to support e-mail browsing as well as querying. A new clustering mechanism is presented which, based on the hierarchical nature of domain names, provides an automatic classification of electronic messages. This representation is combined with a temporal visualization that supports browsing, Boolean searching and threading operations.

Visualising human dialog
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Human dialogue is so complex that definitively analysing patterns of conversation may well be impossible. Within a conversation, all the complexities and ambiguities of natural language exist and each speaker will have his/her own speech characteristics and moods. Examining these characteristics through text dialog can be a demanding cognitive task. One reason is because the whole conversation cannot be viewed at one time. This task can be made more convenient if there is a way of visualising all this information at once through graphical patterns. Graphical patterns can revolve around the conversation, creating an abstract piece of artwork. From these patterns, one can guess at the speaker's emotion and how he/she is connected to another speaker during a conversation. This paper discusses the different visualisation techniques that are used to represent several aspects of a conversation.

A formal definition of the Users View (UV) of the Graphical Object Query Language (GOQL)
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
We provide a brief formal definition of the Users View (UV) of the Graphical Object Query Language (GOQL). The UV provides a graphical representation for object-oriented database schemas and hides from end-users most of the perplexing details of the object-oriented database model, such as methods, hierarchies and relationships. In particular, the UV does not distinguish between methods, attributes and relationships, encapsulates the is-a hierarchy and utilises a number of desktop metaphors to present a graphical schema that is easy to be understood by end-users. Thus, the UV provides the environment, through which end-users, can pose ad-hoc queries through GOQL. We first give a brief formal definition of an object-oriented database schema in the GOQL model. This is given, by providing a formal definition of the basic element of such a schema, namely the class. The UV is then briefly formally defined as a mapping from a GOQL object-oriented database schema. Using this mapping, any object-oriented database schema can be translated into a graphical representation in the UV. The running example of the paper is used to demonstrate the mapping from the textual schema to the graphical schema of the UV. The formal definition of the UV will allow us, in the future, to formally define the graphical constructs of GOQL.

The development of a functional visualization system for the creation of digital human models
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
The design of artifacts and environments for people with disabilities has been frustrated by the lack of design oriented digital human models (DHM). This paper describes a process for the development of a functional visualization system (FVS) for the creation of DHM for use by designers and progress made in the development of the FVS. The system employs a 'synthetic' or 'human figure model' approach and includes standard measurement procedures for the capture of anthropometric data, the development of computer programs and processes for the visualization of the data which has been captured, the verification of collected data and the investigation of the utilization of visualization tools by designers and clinicians.

Fitting curve to planar digital data
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
An optimal curve fitting technique has been developed which is meant to automatically provide a fit to any ordered digital data in a plane. A more flexible class of rational cubic functions is the basis of this technique. This class of functions involves two control parameters, which help to produce an optimal curve fit. The curve technique has used various ideas for curve design. These ideas include end-point interpolation, intermediate point interpolation, detection of characteristic points, and parameterization. The final shape is achieved by stitching the generalized Bezier cubic pieces with C/sup 1/ smoothness.

2002
We describe AudioCave, an environment for exploring the impact of spatialising sonified graphs on a set of numerical data comprehension tasks. Its design builds on findings regarding the effectiveness of sonified graphs for numerical data overview and discovery by visually impaired and blind students. We demonstrate its use as a test bed for comparing the approach of accessing a single sonified numerical datum at a time to one where multiple sonified numerical data can be accessed concurrently. Results from this experiment show that concurrent access facilitates the tackling of our set multivariate data comprehension tasks. AudioCave also demonstrates how the spatialisation of the sonified graphs provides opportunities for sharing the representation. We present two experiments investigating users solving set data comprehension tasks collaboratively by sharing the data representation.

Generating bipedal animation using dynamic implementation
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
This paper addresses the problem faced by animators in creating accurate and realistic walk cycles, as well as coherent interaction with the immediate production environment. Modern software packages often contain modules for implementing dynamics, without the need for specialist programs. In this paper, how to best use these modules to create the desired realistic effects is explored and expanded upon, including driving forces for balanced bipedal motion, friction/slippage between the feet of the model and the surface walked upon. A simple "wind-up" toy model is used as an example for the demonstration of the process, but the approaches taken could be similarly extended into more complicated models and applications.

Issues in delivering multimedia content to mobile devices
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
The scalability of a computer system is its response to growth. It is also depends on its hardware, its operating system and the applications it is running. Most distributed systems technology today still depends on bus-based shared memory which do not scale well, and systems based on the grid or hypercube scheme requires significantly less connections than a full inter-connection that would exhibit a quadratic growth rate. The rapid convergence of mobile communication, digital broadcasting and network infrastructures calls for rich multimedia content that is adaptive and responsive to the needs of individuals, businesses and the public organisations This paper discusses the emergence of mobile multimedia systems and provides an overview of the issues regarding design and delivery of multimedia content to mobile devices.

We show that two-point G/sup 2/ Hermite cubic spline interpolation to a smooth spiral is a spiral. Its unit tangent matches given unit tangents and its signed curvature matches given signed curvatures at end points of the given spiral. Spiral segments are useful in the design of fair curves and have the advantages that there are no unplanned curvature maxima, curvature minima, or inflection points, and that loops and cusps are impossible within a segment.

Using Orchid diagrams for information visualisation

Solving multi-goal scenario-based decision problems is difficult, especially when preferences are uncertain. Often, a mathematically sound solution is unsatisfactory due to the restricted nature of the model. This paper describes a way to visually represent these problems. The visual representation, using flower-shaped Orchid diagrams, focuses on attracting attention to the important facts without removing secondary information. It also describes a special technique to 'zoom' in on certain results.

Free form modeling method based on silhouette and boundary lines
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
In the initial process of exterior design of a product, designers often get the idea of a designing product form as silhouette lines and boundary lines. Therefore, if the 3D model is constructed from silhouette lines and boundary lines, designers will be significantly assisted in the process of external form design. This paper describes a system to construct a 3D model with complex curved surfaces from silhouette and boundary lines. The silhouette and boundary lines can be easily given by a computer mouse or a tablet and are then approximated by cubic Bezier curves linked with curvature continuity at the connected points. A Bezier surface is defined from the four lines as the silhouette or boundary by an originally developed algorithm. The 3D model is then constructed by Bezier surfaces with curvature continuity on the connecting lines. Since the system does not obstruct designer thinking due to simple operations of the system, designers can elaborate and confirm the idea by considering and examining the form indicated by the system.

Improving the modified global smoothing method for spatial distributed and large data-sets to use it in the real-time visualisation of simulation and measurement information
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
With the high-speed development. of computer systems having performance values of calculation machines, which needed one or more rooms of place and a special air conditioning a few years ago, the usage of methods dealing with a high amount of data at one side, and the need of doing a enormous number of calculation work at the other side became used more and more frequently. Tunnelling is one major field, where this advance is very important. That field of science is regarded as one of the more difficult engineering tasks. This is due to the fact that tunnels are excavated in a material whose mechanical and hydraulic properties are highly variable and whose behaviour is difficult to describe to a numerical simulation model. Numerical simulation of tunnel advance can serve as a powerful tool in the design and decision making on site. But this has to be done almost in real-time, that means that the calculation and the necessary post-processing must be finished, before the engineer on site is forced to make his decisions. This circumstance places a very specific challenge to the used hard- and software. This paper describes an algorithm, its development and improvements, which have been done, to find a method of data processing for the purpose of scientific visualisation with the necessary properties.

Using visualization for information management tasks

Taxonomies are a powerful modelling tool when building interfaces for disclosing large information repositories. However, their actual use is far from trivial; tasks such as creation, instantiation and maintenance of taxonomies are often difficult and time-consuming. We present a number of ways in which the cluster map, a component for the visualization of instantiated taxonomies, can help in these tasks. Using the proposed visualizations, a user gains insight in the information, detects anomalies, monitors the information as it evolves over time and assesses the quality of the output of automatic classification tools. The proposed visualizations are presented in the context of one of our customers, for which we create Web portals based on taxonomies, providing access to a large document collection.

Incorporating constraints into a Virtual Reality environment for intuitive and precise solid modelling
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
The absence of constraints is one of the major limitations in current Virtual Reality (VR) environments. Without constraints, it is difficult to perform precise 3D interactive manipulations in VR environments and precise solid modelling in VR environments cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, constraints are incorporated into the VR environment for intuitive and precise solid modelling. A hierarchically structured constraint-based data model is developed to support solid modelling in the VR environment. Solid modelling in the VR environment is precisely performed in an intuitive manner through constraint-based manipulations. Constraint-based manipulations are accompanied with automatic constraint recognition and precise constraint satisfaction to establish the hierarchically structured constraint-based data model and are realized by allowable motions for precise 3D interactions in the VR environment. The allowable motions are represented as a mathematical matrix for conveniently deriving allowable motions from constraints. A procedure-based degree-of-freedom incorporation approach for 3D constraint solving is presented for deriving the allowable motions. A rule-based constraint recognition engine is developed for both constraint-based manipulations and implicitly incorporating constraints into the VR environment. A prototype system has been implemented for precise solid modelling in an intuitive manner through constraint-based manipulations in the VR environment.

Tudumi: information visualization system for monitoring and auditing computer logs
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2002
Computer security breaches are already a major problem in using computers. The most basic defense against it is to monitor and audit the computer logs. Computer logs, however have a huge amount of textual data. It is, therefore, almost impossible to inspect them manually using current systems. We propose a log visualization system called "Tudumi". Tudumi consists of several functions which assist system administrators to perform such tasks manually. These functions are information visualization, log summarization and reflecting known rules into the visualization method. Tudumi makes it easier to detect anomalous user activities, such as intrusion, from a huge amount of computer logs.

We propose 'Trace View', a static visualization method for monitoring and debugging the dynamic behavior of programs written in dataflow visual programming languages. Trace View presents a hierarchical structure of the dataflow between nodes that is created over the execution time of the program. The view also serves as an interface that allows the programmer to select a data stream link when data must be examined during debugging. Moreover since visualization grows in size according to the life time of the program, we have developed techniques to scale the view using a multi-focus focus+context view.

This paper introduces an immersive virtual reality application that allows users to browse and explore the contents of database systems. We have implemented a visualization metaphor that is based upon the intrinsic characteristics of particles, coined 'infolicles', which are used as representations of data objects. Users are able to interact with the dynamic, three-dimensional visualization by manipulating forces and surfaces. These tools, representing respectively user interests and data filters, influence the collection of infolicles according to the rules of Newtonian mechanics. Informational values are expressed through the presence of both dynamic and static characteristics such as motion, directionality, and form. We demonstrate these principles through a prototype that uses our university's financial budget data.

Data mining information visualisation - beyond charts and graphs

2002
Data mining has become a major academic research area over the last ten years. However, in the transition from academic prototypes to commercial products there have been few successes with commercial data mining applications failing to make any significant impact in the marketplace. In this paper it is argued that most data mining applications concentrate on the model-building phase of the data mining process and rarely engage the user in other stages. The paper reviews the challenges of producing successful data mining applications and in particular the role of information visualisation. Visualisation in data mining tends to be used to present final results, rather than playing an important part throughout the entire process. We argue that an immersive environment may provide the user with a more suitable interface than is commonly offered. We present a virtual data mining environment which attempts to integrate a data mining application interface and information visualisation in a seamless manner, using the concept of 'liquid data'.

2002
We present a new visualization approach for metadata combining different visualizations into a so-called SuperTable accompanied by a Scatterplot. The goal is to improve user experience during the information seeking process. Our new visualizations are based on our experiences developing a visual information retrieval system called INSYDER to supply small and medium size enterprises with business information front the Internet. Based on extensive user tests the original visualizations have been redesigned in two different design variants. Instead of offering multiple visualizations to choose front the SuperTable + Scatterplot combines them in a new way. Therefore, the user has the feeling that he is working with one single visualization in different states. Further the SuperTable solves a problem which seemed to be immanent to visualization's in document retrieval: the change of modalities.

Incrementally visualising criminal networks
Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2002
Understanding the information gathered thus far in a criminal investigation is of great importance, particularly in terms of guiding its future course. Since the late 1980's the use of software tools to provide visualisations of this information has become increasingly common. The objective of such tools is to provide, in a readily comprehensible way, the social network of all the people involved. This may include the victims, suspects, witnesses, acquaintances and locations of interest in the investigation such as workplaces or nightclubs. Such diagrammatic representations often provide the focus for discussion among the investigating team and are incrementally added to as new facts are discovered. In this paper we present a brief overview of this important subject area and discuss how such software products could be further enhanced. We also present an example that illustrates the basic principles using a demonstrator we developed.

Information visualisation systems often have to cope with presenting large amounts of data. In this paper we look at the problem of reducing the display density through the use of random sampling. We review some of the uses of sampling and examine density reduction techniques currently used in visualisation. We then look at a proposed novel visualisation that utilises sampling and discuss many issues that arise. Furthermore, we propose the /spl zeta/DB sampling database architecture and demonstrate how this can be used to enhance current visualisation applications. Finally, we describe the architecture of a sampling aware application and illustrate its advantages.

Given a facial image of a particular person, aging is to construct the facial image of the same person but at a different age. This assumption becomes an important limitation when modelling human aging from real data, especially in order to be used by plastic surgeons.

Our analysis-synthesis cooperation, possible thanks to a highly realistic 3D head model and in comparison with a youthful age face of the same person. A prototype of aging a specific region of someone's face, which utilizes a framework for facial feature is presented.

Recently the considerable potential of virtual reality has been recognized for the scientific study, diagnosis and treatment in the field of mental healthcare. It provides a unique opportunity to provide a natural interface and to mimic actual challenges faced by impaired subjects in their lives. In spite of certain limitations, some work has emerged which provides guidelines for future research efforts. A shortlist of such applications includes assessment and treatment of phobias; obsessive compulsive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorders and hyperactive attention deficit syndromes. We highlight these recent and ongoing research projects and compare this unique paradigm with conventional nonVR techniques by discussion of potential benefits and possible shortcomings. Due to the nature of research, ethical and human factors cannot be over emphasized. We also describe the limitations of VR in the field of practical psychology as media hype has over sold its potential. With recent advances in technology, it is not unrealistic to hope that VR will soon be a part of a clinician's armoury.

Exploring Web site log data with a multi-classification interface

2003
Many interface designs have been developed for the exploration of multidimensional data sets, many based on finding subsets by filtering attribute values independently or successively. However, many of these interfaces do not also support the use of hierarchies for selection and summarisation. We show how an interface that uses coordinated hierarchy views of data supports the exploration of such data. Our interface is demonstrated with our SGViewer tool and a Web site log dataset where visits to a Web site have been organised into time, downloads, visitor address and referrer address dimensions. A configurable nested tree visualisation is used to present each dimension hierarchy. We show how both rapid and flexible exploration of this data is supported by our interface.

Amharic character recognition using a fast signature based algorithm
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
The Amharic language is the principal language of over 20 million people mainly in Ethiopia. An extensive literature survey reveals no journal or conference papers on Amharic character recognition. The Amharic script has 33 basic characters each with seven orders giving 231 distinct characters, not including numbers and punctuation symbols. The characters are cursive but not connected and unlike other cursive scripts do not use dots. We describe the Amharic script and discuss the difficulties of applying conventional structural and syntactic recognition processes. Two statistical algorithms for identifying Amharic characters are described. In both, the characters are normalised for both size and orientation. The first compares the character against a series of templates. The second derives a characteristic signature from the character and compares this against a set of signature templates. The signatures used are fifty times smaller than the original character and the recognition process is corresponding faster but with some loss of accuracy. The statistical techniques described have been fully implemented and the resulting performance outlined.

Determining candidate binding site locations using conserved features
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
We present a method for representing important conserved features of a protein directly involved in binding. The conserved features are observed by noticing common atoms in proteins that bind a ligand. A method for constructing a fingerprint based upon the geometric configuration of the atoms in the binding region of the protein is presented. The fingerprint can be applied to other protein structural PDB (protein data bank) files to facilitate identification of the specific binding site the fingerprint represents. The algorithm presented complements software developed at the University of Luton, TMSite, and can be used with the ClustalW alignment tool. By matching one amino acid of the fingerprint onto a new protein, then using it as an anchor and searching for the other corresponding amino acids around it gives a simple method to find possible binding sites. The more points of the fingerprint matched the less likely the match is to be coincidental. Thresholds, both geometrical and biochemical, can be altered to adjust sensitivity of the search. This method will be implemented in TMBoundary, a current software project, as an alternative or complementary search method for binding sites in proteins of known structure.

Treecube: visualization tool for browsing 3D multimedia data
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
We propose a new 3D visualization tool for hierarchical information. A 2D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treemap has already been proposed by Ben Shneiderman, et al. in 1992. In general, hierarchical information is represented as a tree structure. Treemap hierarchically lays out each node as a bounding box whose size is the same as the specific weight or attribute value of the node. After the original treemap algorithm called slice-and-dice, some extensions to it have been proposed: squarified treemap (M. Buls et al., 2000), ordered treemap (B. Shneiderman et al., 2001) and strip treemap (B.B. Bederson et al., 2002). Furthermore, quantum treemap (B.B. Bederson et al., 2002) is a quantization version of these extensions. We propose a new 3D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treecube that can be taken as a 3D extension of treemap. Especially, we show its usefulness for browsing 3D multimedia data, i.e., 2D images, 3D shape models, motion data, etc., originally stored in a file system.

Extracting actionable insight from large high dimensional data sets, and its use for more effective decision-making, has become a pervasive problem across many fields in research and industry. We describe an investigation of the application of tightly coupled statistical and visual analysis techniques to this task. The approach we choose is "unsupervised learning" where we investigate the advantages offered by close coupling of the self-organizing map algorithm with new combinations of visualization components and techniques for interactivity.

A model of synchronous collaborative information visualization
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.

2003
We describe a model of the process by which people solve problems using information visualization systems. The model was based on video analysis of forty dyads who performed information visualization tasks in an experiment. We examined the following variables: focused questions vs. free data discovery, remote vs. collocated collaboration, and systems judged to have high and low transparency. The model describes the stages of reasoning and generating solutions with visual data. We found the model to be fairly robust across task type, collaborative setting, and system type, though subtle differences were found. We propose that system transparency can support some stages of the process, and that support is needed in the last stage to help users translate their findings from visual to written representations.

An immersive path editor for keyframe animation using hand direct manipulation and 3D gearbox widgets
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
A prototype transition path editing tool for use in an immersive environment has been developed, which can be used for 3D keyframe animation authoring and editing of 3D transition paths. Authoring tools using 2D GUI is normally used to develop 3D animation. However, it is more direct to create 3D contents in a 3D space than in a 2D GUI. Therefore hand direct manipulation is employed to utilize body motion in the developed tool. Direct manipulation by hand is easy to understand and easy to use for rough positioning but it is not suitable for fine adjustments of virtual objects in an immersive environment because it is difficult to hold a hand at a fixed point without support in midair. A gearbox widget has been newly implemented to enable a user to adjust a value both roughly and minutely. In the immersive path editing tool, the developed widget and direct manipulation are combined to enhance efficiency of the immersive 3D authoring of keyframe animation.

There is now a growing awareness of the possibilities for application of natural language in the computing domain by incorporating knowledge of human-to-human interaction. We present an approach that aims to bridge the gap between scripting/storyboarding by a nontechnical creative writer and rendering characters and scenes by a graphics specialist. Natural language processing (NLP) and 3D graphic presentation is used to manipulate 3D scenes in real time. The proposed technique offers a flexible and easy way to generate an interactive 3DVE as compared with traditional 3D packages.

The development of a method to inform CMC design for visual communication
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
An essential characteristic of design communication is the need to talk about things (objects and concepts). We concern the development of a practical method to assist the iterative development of computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems that support talk by designers working co-operatively over distance. Previous approaches to the study of CMC systems limit the extent to which the value of new media and mechanisms can be explored. We have developed an alternative method to exploring CMCs based on shifts between communication resources during design activity, based on Scrivener's (2000) postulate that users in a communication environment satisfy their communication purposes by selecting from the available resources those most appropriate for their communication purpose. Such shifts reveal insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of the communication channels. We outline the rationale behind shift analysis, provide examples of the analysis and conclude by reviewing the steps needed to use this method in iterative CMC development.

Labeled radial drawing of data structures

2003
We describe a radial layout method for displaying B/sup +/-tree data structures. We present an algorithmic framework for computing the node positions that result in a planar drawing. Layout issues related to displaying the internal structure of the nodes are addressed. Each field value and associated pointer that comprises the internal structure of the node is considered a subnode. The drawing technique uses different polygonal shapes for the subnodes that allow curvature to the design. We discuss the layout of text labels for the fields of the nodes which provides good readability and which preserves the semantics of the data structure. The edge positioning shows the association of the pointers with their corresponding field label. The radial drawing of the B/sup +/-tree makes better use of the display space than the traditional hierarchical drawing.

Objective and subjective relations in data visualization: examples from molecular biological data collections
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
Natural science is where the objective and the subjective meet. When we build data collections, we want them to reflect the objective relations inherent in nature, but also classify these collections, adding subjective relations between data objects. Sometimes these two approaches conflict. We present two examples of blending objective and subjective relations in a single data collection, and discuss some possible generalizations. First example deals with the visualization of metabolic networks in three dimensions. We show that the network topology has a substantial subjective component in this case and discuss possible ways to minimize human inference. In the second example we present a collection of metabolic networks as a (subjective) hierarchical structure with (objective) binary relations between objects, and show how the data visualization may be made more logical via the procedure of "hierarchization of relations".

A new approach to virtual design for spatial configuration problems
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.

2003
We present a new framework for the use of virtual reality (VR) in engineering design for configuration applications. Traditional VR systems support the visual exploration of a design solution but do not assist the user in exploring alternative solutions based on domain knowledge. Extending previous work in the area of intelligent virtual environment, we propose an intelligent configuration system based on constraint logic programming (CLP), integrated in a real-time 3D graphic environment. This type of integration facilitates the expression of design knowledge in the VE and enables the user to interactively solve and/or refine a spatial configuration problem. In the system described, the user can visually explore configurations, but his interaction with objects of the configuration problem triggers new cycles of constraint propagation from the modified configuration to produce a new compatible solution.

Textured voxels based method for display speed up

2003
We present a novel method for the simplification of three-dimensional objects in order to optimise display. This is an incremental method with a specific feature: the processed scenes are simultaneously shown with two degrees of detail - precise and coarse. This allows for the creation of different types of simplification and adapts the geometrical and photometrical representation of the objects and scenes to precision and speed requirements. Voxels and textures are used in this method and it works with all kinds of object modelling. This method is based on the idea that in order to effectively reduce the volume of information to be processed while providing accurate rendering and fast display, we have to concentrate on the less visible pans of objects.

We follow on from a group of internationally published papers in the area of investigating anthropomorphic user interface feedback. An experiment is described which aims to examine the effectiveness and user approval issues of anthropomorphic versus nonanthropomorphic user interface feedback. This experiment is highly relevant to the research community as computer scientists are not in agreement concerning the effectiveness and user approval of anthropomorphic user interfaces. The experiment described is in the context of online factual delivery. Specifically the area of direction finding was used to test anthropomorphic feedback against nonanthropomorphic feedback. Statistically significant results are presented for the benefit of the research community, where it is clear that in this context, the nonanthropomorphic user interface feedback was more effective and users tended to prefer this feedback.

We propose a framework for generating an information access space from existing knowledge repositories. Currently, vast amounts of information are being accumulated at accelerating paces in many fields. These include multimedia documents, application program and services. We need new access architecture for organizing and accessing intellectual assets. We propose the use of context as a data modelling mechanism and the construction of an interactive information access space to support users' intuitive access to large amounts of information. A context is a modular representation of information under different perspectives. A context-based information access space enables operations over contextualized objects. We describe the component-based framework and implementation of a context-based information access space.

Real-time expressive rendering of city models

City models have become central elements for visually communicating spatial information related to urban areas and have manifold applications. Our real-time nonphotorealistic rendering technique aims at abstract, comprehensible, and vivid drawings of assemblies of polygonal 3D urban objects. It takes into account related principles in cartography, cognition, and nonphotorealism. Technically, the geometry of a building is rendered using expressive line drawings to enhance the edges, two-tone or three-tone shading to draw the faces, and simulated shadows. The edge enhancement offers several degrees of freedom, such as interactively changing the style, width, tilt, color, transparency, and length of the strokes. Traditional drawings of cities and panoramas inspired the tone shading that achieves a pleasing visual color effect. The rendering technique can be applied not only to city models but to polygonal shapes in general.

Face representation and reconstruction under different illumination conditions
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
To deal with image variations due to illumination problem, Ramamoorthi and Basri have independently derived a spherical harmonic analysis for the Lambertian reflectance and linear subspace. Their theoretical work provided a new approach for face representation, however both of them assume that the 3D surface normals and albedo (or unit albedo) are known, which limit this algorithm's application. We present a novel method for modelling 3D face shape and albedo from only three images and this work will fill the blank which Ramamoorthi and Basri left. Our work is closely related to photometric stereo, but conditions of photometric stereo for estimating albedo and surface normal are too strict to be applied for real application. Moreover, the conventionally used singular value decomposition (SVD) approach leads to the notorious linear ambiguity and the solution to this problem needs to introduce more constraints or more images. By taking advantage of similar 3D shape of all human faces, the highlight of the new method is that it circumambulates the linear ambiguity by 3D alignment. The experiment results show that our estimated model can be perfectly employed to face recognition and 3D reconstruction.

Many algorithms exist to determine if a given graph can be embedded in a plane [G. Di Battistia et al., (1994)]. The majority of these methods, however, are only valid for simple graphs and do not take into account the order of edges emanating from each vertex. There are many areas, such as communication design, genetics, group theory, network optimisation and VLSI, where the ordering of edges is crucial to the representation of a system. Rotation schemes can be used to store the ordering of edges around a vertex. Let G be an arbitrary, possibly nonsimple, graph. We provide an algorithm that determines, from the rotation scheme of G, if G can be embedded in the plane. If the rotation scheme of G can be realised by a planar drawing, the regions of G are returned.

The current ability to record neural activity within the brains of mammals has led to the production of a large body of experimental data. The analysis and comprehension of this data is key to the understanding of many basic brains functions, for example learning and memory. The main constituent of this data is multidimensional spike train recordings. As the analysis of these datasets by traditional means becomes more complex and time consuming, the need for better methods of data analysis increases. We present an innovative method for analysis of the relationships within large multidimensional spike train datasets. This method, called the 'correlation grid', is based on the information visualisation principles; overview the data, filter and zoom the data and obtain details-on-demand (B. Shneiderman, (1996). The features of the correlation grid are described, including filtering and statistical sorting methods.

We find a practical solution to improve remote 3D measurement accuracy by investigating surface effects on a real-virtual object alignment task in a stereoscopic augmented reality environment. A psychophysical method of adjustment was used for aligning a computer-generated graphic virtual pointer with the designated targets on the image of a real hemisphere surface. The known conflict between binocular fusion and object occlusion cues was confirmed to play a major role as an extra depth cue. Surface texture density had significant impact on real-virtual object alignment task. A model was proposed for the process of detecting the interactions of real-virtual objects and guidelines were also given for augmented reality interface design accordingly.

Mental representations and visualization processes in organizational memories
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.

2003
Visual metaphors describe cognitive processes in every part of life and function as a connection between what we see and what we think. Mental activities and perceptional interactions of the real world are often interdependent and occur mutually. Cognition is enhanced by the use of the real world, in particular the use of cognitive artifacts or physical inventions (S. K. Card, et al., 1999). We describe the process from perception to information, explain different models of mental representations, and introduce Chi's visualization process. We use these theories and models to introduce and evaluate different visualization tools, which are positioned to explore and navigate a groupware-based organizational memory that is presented as a small case. We point out how the different characteristics and functionalities of these visualization tools contribute to a synergetic match of visual metaphors and cognitive processes.

The transfer of knowledge from research laboratories and academic seminars to the industrial/commercial sector is a strategically important issue. Text analysis of journal papers and patent documents, written by one scientist and his team in the specialist area of semiconductor physics, has been performed in order to visualize the cross-over of research knowledge onto patented artifacts. The results shows the time lag in the cross-over and will serve to bring knowledge visualization and information extraction techniques in the rather quantitative arena of strategic policy making in science and its application to technology.

Trifocal morphing
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
Image morphing allows smooth transition between 2D images. However, one of the limitations of existing image morphing techniques is the lack of interaction - the viewpoints of the interpolated images are restrained to the line joining the optical centers of the source and the destination images. Another limitation of existing image morphing techniques is that shape warping often causes distortion due to barycentric mapping. We present our trifocal morphing technique to address these problems. The new technique allows a user to change the viewpoint of the output images, i.e., increasing the degrees of freedom of interaction, and supports both interpolation and extrapolation. By making use of the intrinsic geometric relationship among the reference images for projective transformation, the distortion from barycentric mapping is also prevented. Unlike other warping-based view transferring techniques, trifocal morphing provides very smooth transition between reference images and supports both rigid and nonrigid scenes.

Recreating our selves: ZENetic computer
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
We tried to develop an interactive system that could help us recreate our conscious selves by calling on Buddhist principles, Asian philosophy, and traditional Japanese culture through the inspirational media of ink painting, kimono and haiku. "Recreating our selves" means the process of making the consciousness of our 'daily self' meet that of our 'hidden self' through rediscovering creative resources deep within us that may have been forgotten but still resonate with vital meaning. In other words, this interactive system is based on the effort to meld our consciousness and unconsciousness in complete harmony. It is difficult to achieve this through traditional logic-based interaction. We succeeded in reaching this goal by setting as our target of scientific computing images from the above traditional Japanese media.

A three-dimensional visualization of communications in distributed program environments

2003
In order to understand the behaviour of distributed program environments, we describe a three-dimensional visualization of communications. Most previous visualizations presented communications by means of the two dimensions of time and process, however, three dimensions are required to represent a message intermediary with visualization functions. We make use of a semantic configuration of messages, which is constructed by the quantities for three parametric factors: (i) time sequence, (ii) identifications of processors, and (iii) message exchanges.

Using curves to enhance parallel coordinate visualisations
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.

2003
We introduce a number of refinements to the parallel coordinates visualisation metaphor for multidimensional data. Firstly, the traditional set of polylines are replaced with a collection of smooth curves across the attribute axes, allowing individual data elements to be traced under certain limitations; normally impossible due to the 'crossing problem'. Then the notion of spreading out points on axes with a few discrete values is introduced, which leads onto a simple focus+context technique when the user selects values on such axes.

Computer animation and visualisation techniques of mechanical products for assembly analysis

2003
The computer animation and visualisation techniques allow the acquisition of important information which can aid the designer in correcting and controlling the product from early conceptual design phase to the final assembly design stage. The computer assembly animation of a mechanical product is shown utilising a commercial CAD system. By utilising appropriately some features of the CAD system, a general trajectory can be assigned for each mating product component that allows us to analyse either the local and global product assemblability/disassemblability or to analyze feasible disassembling trajectories which guarantee that no collisions happen. An application regarding a mechanical assembly product is illustrated.

Pointing the finger; a role for hybrid representations in VR and video?
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
Experience gained in associating interpretative VRML modelling with real-time video has demonstrated that it is an effective technique for explaining the content of the video image. However searching the VRML model requires interactive exploration by the user. It is more difficult for the viewer to quickly identify the location of an object of interest in the video image, if a search is run in the database to return the location of an object or objects in the image. It is suggested that there are a number of instances where it would be useful to distort a photo realistic modelled scene to draw attention to specific-portions, ranging from the representation of uncertainty in archaeological presentations or planning proposals, to the identification of the location of an object of interest in a video clip or live video frame. The advantages and disadvantages of some possible approaches are discussed.

We present a new framework for metadata visualisation systems called VisMeB (visual metadata browser). It is based upon redesign ideas from the IN-SYDER system that were come under extensive evaluations.

We use a ScatterPlot in combination with a so called SuperTable for visualisation. The two techniques are tightly coupled and present unique possibilities of interaction through the use of visual filters.

A heuristic for k-broadcasting in arbitrary networks

2003
We present a heuristic algorithm for k-broadcasting in an arbitrary network. This heuristic generates optimal k-broadcast time in grid graph when k/spl ges/2. In two-dimensional torus graph, it also generates optimal k-broadcast time when k/spl ges/3, while giving a bound of /spl lfloor/m/2/spl rfloor/+/spl lfloor/n/2/spl rfloor/+1 when k=2, where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the graph. In practice, the new heuristic outperforms best known 1-broadcast algorithm for three different network design models. The new algorithm runs fast. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(R /spl middot/ m), where R represents the rounds of broadcasting, and m stands for the total number of edges in the graph.

A new algorithm for transitive closures and computation of recursion in relational databases
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
We propose a new algorithm for computing recursive closures. The main idea behind this algorithm is tree labeling and graph decomposition, based on which the transitive closure of a directed graph can be computed in O(e/spl middot/d/sub max//spl middot/d/sub out/) time and in O(n/spl middot/d/sub max//spl middot/d/sub out/) space, where n is the number of the nodes of the graph, e is the numbers of the edges, d/sub max/ is the maximal indegree of the nodes, and d/sub out/ is the average outdegree of the nodes. Especially, this method can be used to efficiently compute recursive relationships of a directed graph in a relational environment.

We describe a simple algorithm for level-wise enumeration of the global states of a distributed computation. In addition to fast execution, it requires working memory for only two global states plus a variable amount of memory which permits the trading of higher speed for storage. Furthermore, we present a new caching strategy that speeds up the state enumeration algorithm described in [A. Andrzejak et al., (2003)].

A 3D metaphor for software production visualization

Software development is difficult because software is complex, the software production process is complex and understanding of software systems is a challenge.

Tools for visual comparison of spatial development scenarios

2003
We suggest a set of visualization-based exploratory tools to support analysis and comparison of different spatial development scenarios, such as results of simulation of various spatially related processes. We have applied a task-analytical approach to tool selection and design, that is, we have first considered what analytical tasks may potentially emerge in the course of investigating and comparing scenarios. We have revealed a set of multifarious tasks, which can be grouped into four categories: 1) analysis in the attribute dimension; 2) analysis in the spatial dimension; 3) analysis in the temporal dimension; 4) spatio-temporal analysis. Then we have evaluated the techniques typically used for visualization of spatial and temporal data, such as (animated) maps or time graphs, from the perspective of supporting different task types. We have extended these techniques, mostly in the direction of increasing interactivity, and combined them for providing a better coverage of the task space. Using examples from the domains of forest management and agriculture, we illustrate how the resulting software tools help in fulfilling various tasks in the course of exploring and comparing scenarios. At the end, we set an explicit correspondence between the task types and the appropriate tools.

Efficient handling of shading discontinuities for progressive meshes

None
2003
For visual perception of 3D models, shading plays one of the major roles. The shading quality of level-of-detail models is limited generally because existing LOD algorithms assume a conceptually smooth surface. A complex mesh, however, is likely to have conceptually smooth and angular parts. We introduce an extension to the progressive mesh LOD approach that efficiently handles triangle meshes with large numbers of shading discontinuities. For this, the algorithm distinguishes three principal shading situations for mesh vertices: completely continuous shading, completely discontinuous shading, and mixed continuous/discontinuous shading. Remarkably, the algorithm does not introduce any overhead for completely smooth surfaces. As one field of application, we briefly outline its application for LOD representations of 3D city models.

2003
In surgery, virtual and augmented reality are increasingly being used as new ways of training, preoperative planning, diagnosis and surgical navigation. Further development of virtual and augmented reality in medicine is moving towards photorealistic rendering and patient specific modeling, permitting high fidelity visual examination and user interaction. This coincides with the current development in computer vision and graphics where image information is used directly to render novel views of a scene. These techniques require extensive use of geometric information about the scene and provide a comprehensive review of the underlying techniques required for building patient specific models with photorealstic rendering. It also highlights some of the opportunities that image based modeling and rendering techniques can offer in the context of minimally invasive surgery.

Visualising and sharing human performance analysis knowledge

When professionals are given the task of analyzing a domain, it is likely that it is not the first time this task has been done. Rather than build upon what is already done they will often redo the work. The key problem that sustains this repetition of effort is the lack of a standard and centralized way to communicate and share the knowledge that results from the analysis. Software architecture for reuse and sharing of analysis knowledge is described, which incorporates a number of Internet technologies. The architecture is based around a visual modelling scheme and can be configured to adapt to the requirements of different organisational requirements.

Visual representation of database queries using structural similarity

2003
It is often useful to get high-level views of datasets in order to identify areas of interest worthy of further exploration. In relational databases, the high-level view can be described using entity-relationship diagrams, which identify relationships between entities in the data model. Such high-level views are useful for database design activities, and can be used to generate user interfaces for constructing queries. This research introduces techniques for visualizing structural similarity of database queries. We demonstrate that individual queries can be visualized using graph visualization techniques. A distance measure based on query structure is proposed that provides database designers and administrators with a high-level perspective of relationships in the underlying data.

Implementing understanding of photography principles to create effective photorealistic 3D rendering

2003
There are a lot of common features that interrelate the similarities between photography and photorealistic 3D rendering. One is tied to the other in terms of principles and technicalities. Both are technically related to the use of a camera. This will involve understanding the properties of space and the camera lens. Thus, the two important things to take into consideration when merging a 3D object with a still photographic image, vice versa, are lighting and perspective. One is prompted to conduct an experiment on the merging of both photography and photorealistic 3D rendering, to create a harmony between the two elements. Based on recent analysis, the quantitative approach for this research is conducted by comparing works produced by final year students from 1997 to 2003. The findings indicate the obvious difference in the understanding of basic design fundamentals accustomed in photography. The second phase of the research is targeted towards the students' maturity in understanding the content of photorealistic 3D in terms of model properties, textures, lighting and rendering.

In literature exist many links to translation of speech into sign language and links to gesturing with avatars. But we cannot get any link to a visualization of background knowledge which deaf people are lacking. The author himself is hearing impaired. Therefore he knows of the importance of a good visualization of information needed to get the correct mental model. He claims that gesturing with avatars should be supplemented by visualization of background-knowledge. Based on the distinction between data, information and knowledge it is shown that efforts must be directed toward the visualization of complex, interlaced and situation-aware data to get the requirements of deaf people in a right manner.

Research in content-based image retrieval is an expanding discipline with an accelerated growth in the last ten years.

We then discuss the features, advantages and limitations of layout and navigation of current classical hierarchical layouts. We finally introduce our new focus+context technique that is simple and fast for the navigation and exploration of the classical hierarchical layouts.

Augmented reality (AR) systems need to be evaluated for their appropriateness for a given task. Three approaches are used to evaluate the waterpump augmented reality tool (WART). The system is assessed using verbal protocol, performance time and a questionnaire. The WART system is compared with a paper version of the assembly instructions. The verbal protocol revealed that there was more cognitive processing for the paper version of task than WART, it took longer to complete the task with WART than the paper version and the questionnaire revealed the effect on performance of problems associated with AR. All of the participants in the evaluation, however, were positive about WART, and appreciated its usefulness.

2003
Over the last decade, there have been several debates concerning the dominance of technology in academic disciplines such as fine arts and graphic design. Advanced imaging devices, such as fMRI and PET scans, have provided researchers with visual information in the field of brain science that may settle these debates. We outline a research study conducted among undergraduate art students to investigate the level of visual perception and creative development. The purpose is to gather basic information that would merit further scientific investigation. Among the groups studied, the research concluded that artistic traits such as visual memory, perception and a critical eye for detail declined 80% as compared to research studies conducted in 1944. We present scientific research in the field of cognition and brain science, suggesting dominant use of technology in the arts retards intellectual and perceptual-motor skills.

In both cases the desire was to present the reconstructions in a public venue for the purpose of enlightenment; to engage the audience in a deeper understanding of the information being presented in a museum environment and to put in context the artifacts seen in a collection with the source in which they originated. The objective was to build an interactive application in which the viewer can intuitively navigate the reconstructed space with an emphasis on conveying the content of the work in a relatively short amount of time.

Adapting single-user visualization software for collaborative use
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
We present our experiences with adapting single-user visualization software for Web-based collaboration. Sun's Java JXTA API was used to adapt an open-source molecular visualization program called Jmol. It was found that by focusing on the program's graphical user interface the software could be quickly transformed into a peer-to-peer application. Our positive experience implies that many useful single-user programs should be transformable into tools that make collaboration across the Web easier to initiate, more spontaneous, and supported by a wide range of visualization software.

RF-Sim: a treatment planning tool for radiofrequency ablation of hepatic tumors
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.

2003
With recent advancements of technology, radiofrequency ablation has become one of the most used techniques to treat liver tumors. But radiologists still have to face the difficulty of planning their treatment while only relying on 2D slices acquired from CT-scan. We present a tool called RF-Sim, being part of a complete 3D reconstruction and visualization project, and including both a realistic radiofrequency ablation simulator for training and rehearsal, and an automatic treatment planner taking into account tumor's environment. They help radiologists to have a better visualization of patients' anatomic structures and pathologies, and allow them to easily find an adequate treatment. They run on a common laptop and can be used in the operating room.

Semantically modified diffusion limited aggregation for visualizing large-scale networks
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is a model of fractal growth. Computer models can simulate the fast aggregation of millions of particles. We propose a modified version of DLA, called semantically modified DLA (SM-DLA), for visualizing large-scale networks. SM-DLA introduces similarity measures between particles so that instead of attaching to the nearest particle in the aggregation, a new particle is stochastically directed to attach to particles that are similar to it. The results of our initial experiment with a co-citation network using SM-DLA are encouraging, suggesting that the algorithm has the potential as an alternative paradigm for visualizing large-scale networks. Further studies in this direction are recommended.

CAEVA: cognitive architecture to evaluate visualization applications
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
We describe a cognitive architecture to evaluate visualization applications (CAEVA). This architecture requires gathering domain knowledge to adapt existing evaluation models to new domains and applications. This architecture has two main components: one for interoperability and one for cognitive models. The interoperability component uses client-server protocols. The cognitive component includes three subcomponents: knowledge about visualization, knowledge about the data domain, and knowledge about data analysis strategies. CAEVA was used to evaluate the visualizations generated to compare environmental products. The cognitive model is written in ACT-R and simulates how human beings use visualizations to perform data analysis tasks. The data produced by the simulation model is validated with empirical data obtained from human subjects performing the same task. The simulation model produces traces that allow researchers to analyze the strategies followed by the users in the task. The data produced by the model allowed us to study the learning process of visualization users.

The need for visualisation applications developed for small handheld devices such as PDAs and intelligent mobiles are growing. A visual user interface VUI model based on zooming user interface techniques (ZUI), to adapt two complete different visualisation application areas; online brand shopping and flood warning system for PDAs, is presented.

4D visualization of highway construction projects
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
Visualization of transportation projects has been shown to be a very effective way of communicating information between interested project parties [Keister, M. et al., (2002)]. In reviewed applications, visualization has been used primarily for communicating information on the geometric design, or as photorealistic representations that place transportation projects within their existing or envisioned built or natural context. A review of examples of transportation visualization also indicates that visualization methods are mostly application specific. We focus on the use of visualization during the construction process of highway projects to facilitate collaborative decision-making on construction scheduling and traffic planning. For the visualization of construction scheduling and traffic planning a 4D technology that makes use of a comprehensive 3D project database is proposed. The same 3D database can be also used for the development of photo-realistic animations that can facilitate the dissemination of traffic measures information to the traveling public during construction. This approach has been used during the construction of a section of a large-scale highway interchange project in Dallas, Texas.

Layout metrics for Euler diagrams
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
We present an aesthetics based method for drawing Euler diagrams. Aesthetic layout metrics have been found to be useful in graph drawing algorithms, which use metrics motivated by aesthetic principles that aid user understanding of diagrams. We have taken a similar approach to Euler diagram drawing, and have defined a set of suitable metrics to be used within a hill climbing multicriteria optimiser to produce "good" drawings. There are added difficulties when drawing Euler diagrams as they are made up of contours whose structural properties of intersection and containment must be preserved under any layout improvements. We describe our Java implementation of a pair of hill climbing variants to find good drawings, a set of metrics that measure aesthetics for good diagram layout, and issues concerning the choice of weightings for a useful combination of the metrics.

2003
We discuss the findings of ongoing research into forensic animation at the University of Nottingham. There are six sections in this presentation. The introduction part explains the general context about the use of forensic animation for court litigation. The second part describes challenges for the computer animation in the courtroom. The third section deals with procedures used to develop a particular forensic animation case study. It depicts a fatal road accident involving a car and two motorbikes on a dual carriage-way in the UK. The fourth section discusses the development of a new methodology for measuring the reliability and accuracy of forensic animation. The fifth section elucidates analysis on knowledge theory and deductive reasoning. Finally, the conclusion part focuses on demonstrating the extent to which a particular frame of animation carries reliable and accurate information (evidence) which will help a judge and jury to understand complex events.

Visualisation of RDF(S)-based information

None
2003
As Resource Description Framework (RDF) reaches maturity, there is an increasing need for tools that support it. A common and natural representation for RDF data is a directed labeled graph. Although there are tools to edit and/or browse RDF graph representations, we found their architecture rigid and not easily amenable to producing effective visual representations, especially for large RDF graphs. We discuss here how GViz, a general purpose graph visualisation tool, allows the easy construction and fine-tuning of various visual exploratory scenarios for RDF data. GViz's extended ability of customizing the visualisation's icons showed to be very useful in the context of RDF graph structures visualisation. Among the presented applications, we mention customizable selections, schema-instance comparison, instances comparison, and schemas comparison (schema evolution). GViz proved to be able not only to visualize large RDF data models, but also to be very flexible in designing scenario-specific queries to support the exploration process.

Different acoustic variables such as pitch, volume, timbre and position can be used to represent quantitative, qualitative and categorical aspects of the information. Such sonifications are particularly useful for those with visual impairments; they are also beneficial in circumstances where visual representations would be impossible to use or to enrich a graphical realization. We demonstrate methods of representing an audible pie chart representation such that the hearer understands the information through an equivalent representation. We implement and evaluate five designs. In each, the user is positioned at the center of the chart and perceives the information through positional sound sources.

We give a brief overview of a new source of data on human anatomy and kinematics created by the EC-funded project VAKHUM. The motivation was to provide support for education at various levels through animated 3D models and finite element meshes of human joints, while making original high-quality raw data available for industrial users. We outline some identified user demands. We further describe the data types and relevant software components employed for accessing and visualising VAKHUM models. The emphasis is on a novel user interface based on focal points and intuitive 3D controls for viewing anatomy that is appropriately registered with kinematics captured by local e.g. electrogoniometry or global e.g. stereophotogrammetry means. The operating scenario for accessing models in the VAKHUM database is outlined. We close with a summary of the work and pointers to future development.

We provide a brief overview of significant developments in new media arts practice and theory during the period 1996-2001. It draws from a Web-based hypermedia doctoral dissertation entitled 'realising the virtual: the Internet as a space for transformatory art practice' which incorporates creative works undertaken as research and praxis. The dissertation addressed the question of the potential of Internet-based new media arts practice, as a form of cultural activism, to effect positive social change. We trace shifts in art's orientation, through computer and telecommunications mediation, from that of 'a work' to that of 'media' (from materiality to temporality); and in its operational mode, from that of the televisual to the telematic (from vision at a distance to data-banking at a distance). A key focus is the evolution of a new genre, 'netArt', the basis for which is critical engagement 'in the mode of information' [Poster, M., (1990)].

Rendering recognizably unique textures
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
We present a perceptually designed hardware-accelerated algorithm for generating unique background textures for distinguishing documents. To be recognizable, the texture should produce a random feature vector in the brain after visual feature extraction. Our motivating example is a hypertext user interface which shows a fragment of a link's target in the margin. Upon traversing the link, the fragment expands to fill the screen. Our goal is to avoid user disorientation by texturing each document with a unique background so that a document can easily be recognized from a fragment. The user should be able to learn the textures of the most often visited documents, as per Zipf's law. The results of an initial experiment show that the generated textures are indeed recognizable. We discuss a method for enhancing text readability by both providing fast, interactive zooming and unnoticeably bleaching the background around text.

2003
We present our extension for structured fluid simulators and solvers widely used in computer graphics and simulation applications. It is based on storing pre-calculated fluid simulator states (FSS). The simulation using our extension is based on partial computation with synchronous utilization of pre-calculated fluid simulator states stored on disk device. We have incorporated this concept to real-time simulation and visualization system of combustion processes in pulverized coal boilers. The system is based on a simple fluid simulator and a coal particle system. We compared features between classical approach of storing data sets and saving the output of visualization to common movie files formats. Furthermore, we have performed measurements of overall acceleration and disk space requirements. The disk space requirements are in orders less demanding than the ones needed for saving corresponding data sets. This allows better scalability and storing and replaying results of complex tasks with large grids and/or ten thousands of particles.

The Stardinates are a novel interactive information visualization (InfoVis) technique, which aims at visualizing highly structured data. They represent some Gestalt principles very well, especially the principles of Closure and 'Pragnanz'. As a consequence, Stardinates form very distinct and memorable patterns, which make abstraction and aggregation much easier. We give a formal description of the Stardinates as a basis for implementation. Furthermore, we show an application by visualizing psychotherapeutic data derived from a clinical study on anorectic girls.

We introduce a matrix based 'visual reference system model' for architectural heritage. The system consists of multilayered Web pages containing visual and textual data about architectural periods, styles and elements. The structure of the system may be adapted to various architectural concepts and periods. Yet, it is flexible enough to be limited down to a specific period or architect only. The matrix-based structure of the system allows for adding new information at any time. For demonstrational purposes, the system model is applied to a specific domain of classical Ottoman architectural heritage and the site is called as the Mimar Sinan project site (MSPS). MSPS is designed to serve scholars, researchers, architects, designers, and historians for specific, comparative and/or complex research criteria.

We report results from a study on the adoption of an information visualization system by administrative data analysts. Despite the fact that the system was neither fully integrated with their current software tools nor with their existing data analysis practices, analysts identified a number of key benefits that visualization systems provide to their work. These benefits for the most part occurred when analysts went beyond their habitual and well-mastered data analysis routines and engaged in creative discovery processes. We analyze the conditions under which these benefits arose, to inform the design of visualization systems that can better assist the work of administrative data analysts.

We present a data retrieval and information visualisation tool, named the object-oriented graph editor (OOGE). The OOGE is designed to represent information of special kinds of system, hierarchical systems or object-oriented systems. These systems can be represented by object-oriented graph, in which nodes have attributes and their connections are constraint-based. The editor presented provides a friendly graphical user interface for users to define any class of nodes of the OO systems and to draw the OO graph based upon the user-defined node classes. The validity of the proposed system can be checked against the set of constraints that are based on the attributes of the user-defined classes.

Visualization of semantic metadata and ontologies

2003
Implicit information embedded in semantic Web graphs, such as topography, clusters, and disconnected subgraphs is difficult to extract from text files. Visualizations of the graphs can reveal some of these features, but existing systems for visualizing metadata focus on aspects other than understanding the greater structure. We present a tool for generating visualizations of ontologies and metadata by using a modified spring embedder to achieve an automatic layout. Through a case study using a mid-sized ontology, we show that interesting information about the data relationships can be extracted through our visualization of the physical graph structure.

We report results from a project that combined the visualisation of open public greenspace with environmental economics. As part of a methodology using contingent rating which aimed to establish the values placed on specific greenspace sites, three dimensional computer models were used to produce visualisations of particular environmental conditions. Of particular importance to the study was the influence of variables including lighting, season, time of day and weather on the perception of respondents. This study followed previous work which established a suitable approach to the modelling and testing of entirely moveable physical variables within the built environment. As such, the study has further established that visualisation is appropriate within environmental economic surveys, and that there is potential for a holistic range of attributes to be included in such studies.

With the desire towards ad-hoc collaboration across organizations, specifically fostered by grids, static, well-known and preconfigured management topologies are becoming hard to maintain. Dynamic topology creation and exploration is needed when new collaborations are established. Topology across organizational domain is also called management overlay. Algorithms are needed that can self-organize topology, as well as algorithms that can render and update the layout for visualizing topology information presenting management information on operator consoles. Changes constantly occurring in an ad-hoc topology need to be updated and presented accordingly. We discuss ad-hoc topologies and impact on management systems. Our work is based on experiments with various algorithms with self-organizing capabilities and hyperbolic visualization techniques for visualizing ad-hoc topologies for management overlays.

A visual formalism for graphical user interfaces based on state transition diagrams
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.

2003
We present a "lightweight" visual formalism that can be used to examine the state space complexity of an interface. The method can form a basis for designing, testing and documenting the 'front-end' component of a typical GUI forms based interface. The standard is intended to be free standing and seeks to address issues specific to forms based GUI interfaces. The method is based on a state transition diagram (STD) notation that is used to model the GUI component. STDs can be used at an early stage in the design of an interface to quantify and control surface level complexity. Further to allowing a visualisation of the complexity of an interface, techniques used in graph theory are applied to determine a novel measure of complexity that can then be used to better usability.

Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
In the last years real-time visualisation with virtual reality techniques has become to an essential part of numerical simulation in almost all major fields of engineering. This circumstance causes a high percentage of users, having only a basic or no experience in the handling of such systems. Especially in traditional fields of technology like tunnelling the technical staff, researchers or other involved persons are not familiar with the navigation in a virtual environment. An excellent visualisation of the available data that can be used very easy has been shown as absolutely necessary to sell the technology of numerical simulation. The navigation is a central part of the usability of a visualisation tool. We describe the improvements of the navigation of the "Tunnelling Visualisation System -TVS" [Opriessnig, G., (1999)][Opriessnig, G. et al., (2001)] which are collision detection and several modifications of mapping the user input to the virtual reality scene. The reason for these modifications is the improvement of the systems user-friendliness by making the navigation more realistic and exact.

Focus-based clustering for multiscale visualization
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
Previous works on the visualization of navigation history has provided users with overviews that facilitate the retrieval of already visited pages. Most of these techniques rely on the construction of a navigation tree without accounting much for the structure of the underlying hypertext graph. Therefore such views are heavily dependent on the order of page visited. In most cases, they are limited to one session and cannot easily represent large collections of pages. We propose a clustering method based [L. Tauscher et al., (1997)] on a focus [M. Hascoet] on the structure of the underlying hypertext graph. Our aim is to use this method to automatically organize visited pages into a hierarchically clustered graph to provide multiscale visualization of pages visited during several sessions. Our initial experiments with navigation history are promising. We believe that our clustering method is general enough to be applied to other data with an underlying highly connected graph structure.

Towards accurate tumour tracking in lungs

2003
Motivated by radiotherapy and hadrontherapy improvement, we consider in a first step the potential of a simple elastic mechanical modelling to simulate lung deformations and motions during respiration, towards tumour tracking. Two approaches are presented: one is the finite-element based method and the other is the mass-spring system. For these approaches, we suggest a personalisation based on the measurement of physical and geometrical data for each patient.

Exploiting metadata for ontology-based visual exploration of weakly structured text documents
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.

2003
A large amount of strategically relevant business information is contained in unstructured texts. While information brokering approaches are used to contextualize such documents and to generate metadata, text mining is used to explore large document spaces. So far, little attention has been paid on a value-adding combination of these technologies. We show how metadata and documents can be complementarily represented and used interactively to support users in text corpus analysis. We present a text analysis portal which displays inter-document similarity by means of so-called document maps, complemented by a display of the domain ontology and metadata-based access methods.

Distributed geographic information systems typically handle large amounts of data; therefore the transmission and visualisation techniques used need to be scaleable to provide quick, interactive feedback. We introduce such techniques based on the data hierarchy (levels of detail). Namely, we describe focus-and-context visualisation and progressive transmission. The main aim is to discuss the combination of these techniques for different data types and for mixture of these data types.

Visual simulation of refraction phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
We present a simple method for visual simulation of refraction phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere. The method divides the atmosphere into a set of spherical layers and the rays are approximated by circular arcs within the layers. The curvature of arcs is related to the variations of the refractive index. The path of the ray through the atmosphere is found by intersecting the circular arcs with the layers boundaries. The curved rays produce the shape and position distortions of the objects observed through the atmosphere. Depending on the type of distortion we distinguish a large variety of refractive phenomena such as mirages, omega sunsets, fata morgana, green flashes, etc. The described method has been embedded into the simple ray tracer and some images are shown to demonstrate our approach.

A more realistic action-reaction model for virtual environments
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
A method of increasing the realism of nonverbal interaction in 3D is proposed. The method is aimed at creating truly believable autonomous actors in virtual environments. A simple action-reaction interaction model with a predefined set of actions is used. The actions are recognised using weighted-directed graphs (Markov models), using a set of control points as features to reduce the dimensionality of the recognition task, thus enabling fast and effective recognition. The method naturally implements characteristics such as reaction delay and gradual recognition with possible mistakes. The approach is tested on a simplified boxing scenario.

Fast smoothing of superficial respiratory artifacts on medical surfaces
Proceedings on Seventh International Conference on Information Visualization, 2003. IV 2003.
None
2003
Respiratory artifacts appear very often in medical volumes when the subject under examination is in free respiration conditions. Such artifacts cause a severe deformation to the external body anatomy and are visible and enhanced during the 3D reconstruction of the patient surface. We present a dedicated approach for suppressing the respiratory artifacts on planar body contours. The proposed technique leads to an efficient mechanism, which enables the qualitative and quantitative improvement of the respiratory waves on the final reconstructed mesh while preventing the original anatomical features of the body. We show examples and statistical measurements, which demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach for different CT cases.

2003
The UK government started the UK eUniversities project in order to create a virtual campus for online education provisions, competing in a global market. The UKeU (WWW.ukeu.com) claims to "have created a new approach to e-learning" which "opens up a range of exciting opportunities for students, business and industry worldwide" to obtain both postgraduate and undergraduate qualifications. Although there has been many promises about the e-learning revolution using state-of-the-art multimedia technology, closer scrutiny of what is being delivered reveals that many of the e-learning models currently being used are little more than the old text based computer aided learning running on a global network. As part of the UKeU project a consortium of universities have been involved in developing a two year foundation degree from 2004. We look at the approach taken by the consortium in developing global e-learning provisions and the problems and the pitfalls that lay ahead.

Animator: a tool for the animation of parallel coordinates
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
In this paper, an uncommon use of parallel coordinates is illustrated using the Animator software. Animator is used to plot the parallel coordinates of objects in multi-dimensional space. Subsequently, the Animator software is used to animate the movement of individual objects, in this multi-dimensional space over time. Initial empirical studies of this technique for the visualization of data from Neurophysiological research, multi-dimensional spike train datasets, have shown that the technique is useful. Thus, Animator was developed for public access and is now freely available (including source code) from the Visualization Lab at the University of Plymouth, www.plymouth.ac.uk/infovis.

eL-CID (e-Learning by Communicating Iterative Design) demonstrates computer programs' iterative design using computer animation. It translates descriptions of iterative editing into an animated demonstration. An analysis of the work of expert programming trainers shows that successive versions of a program are shown statically. eL-CID attempts to visualise the changes dynamically as if code was being edited in front of the user. Several example demonstrations have been developed. To the author's knowledge, this is the first system designed to visualise the iterative process of program development.

Realistic face modeling with robust correspondences
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Finding robust correspondence is an important problem in structure from motion algorithm. Because the human face contains many low texture and homogeneous areas, some algorithms such as corner matching are unstable and may fail sometimes. We used the face definition parameters and the symmetry of human face as prior knowledge to find reliable correspondences between two pictures, while most SFM algorithms use the generic model as a modulator in the post-processing steps. This work proposes a whole scheme to construct textured 3D face models from two views with a few user interactions. According to the correspondences, a multistage SFM approach is used to reconstruct the structure. Then we use the RBFCS algorithm to interpolate more 3D points according to the scattered feature points. A user with an ordinary camera can use our system to generate his face model in a personal computer.

This work provides a brief introduction and an inspection of my "Digital-Primitive Art" series of artwork and research in 2004. The visual creations of "Digital-Primitive Art" consist of 3D animation/modeling images that are digitalized on centuries-old rawhides, parchments and natural wood, as well as being projected onto both sides of rawhides through video projectors. It offers new dialogue among old and new technologies; early and modern American spiritualities, ephemeral and timeless art forms, and digital and primitive art significations. Artistic perception and technical comprehension are twin brothers in the digital animation family. They mutually accelerate the expansion of computer animation. Maintaining equilibrium among electronic and primitive spirituality, digital technology and ethno-technology is a focus in this art exploration.

The purpose of This work is to demonstrate that a tight dynamical connection may be made between text and interactive visualization imagery. It shows that a bi-directional linkage may be created between the image space of a visualization program and hypertext space so that dynamical image and text representations of a data object are synchronized, thus maintaining the consistency of the visual information and information context. The paper begins with an analysis of the relationship between text and image, drawing upon examples from the history of art. It then discusses how text and imagery may be bound to improve the communication of information. Finally, a simple mapping application is created employing XML, HTML, and scalable vector graphics (SVG) demonstrating these principles.

As structured graphs are widely used in various application areas for conceptual modeling, the need for interactive layout adjusting methods is clearly recognized in the domain of graph drawing applications. We present a graph manipulation method where the process of adjusting and manipulating graphs is broken down into a group of direct and interactive tools. The tools are visualized as large tool-specific mouse cursors that are easily adjustable. Colors and highlighting are used to identify different tools and their operating ranges. According to the usability studies, the tools proved to be reasonably easy to use with only a short introductory time. The users could also select appropriate tools for each manipulation task without problems and were satisfied with the functionality as well as the visualization of the tools. The usefulness of the tools in manipulating graph drawings was also recognized.

2004
In this paper, we present a recursive algorithm for piecewise polygonal approximation of a digital curves. The idea behind is to look for an optimal solution while approximating the given curve segment with a set of longest and minimum line segments such that the maximum squared error is less than the given threshold. The given curve is divided into pieces and parallel processing can be applied to each piece of curve thus making it computationally more efficient. Experimental results show that the proposed method has promising results.

The SCHEMA Network of Excellence aims to bring together a critical mass of universities, research centers, industrial partners and end users, in order to design a reference system for content-based semantic scene analysis, interpretation and understanding. In this paper, advances in the development of the SCHEMA reference system are reported, focusing on the application of region-based image retrieval using automatic segmentation. More specifically, the integration of four segmentation algorithms and the MPEG-7 eXperimentation Model with the reference system are discussed, along with the motivation behind these and various other choices that were made during the development of the reference system. Experimental results for this system, as well as results for an earlier version of it employing proprietary descriptors, are shown using a common collection of images. Comparative evaluation of these versions, both in terms of retrieval accuracy and in terms of time-efficiency, allows the evaluation of the reference system as a whole as well as the evaluation of the usability of different components integrated with it, such as the MPEG-7 eXperimentation Model. These results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed system, as well as its suitability in serving as a test-bed for evaluating and comparing different algorithms and approaches pertaining to the content-based and semantic manipulation of visual information.

In the last decades, many advances have been made in intelligent planning systems. Significant improvements related to core problems, providing faster search algorithms and shortest plans have been proposed. However, there is a lack in researches allowing a better support for a proper use and interaction with planners, where, for instance, visualization can play an important role. This work proposes a way to address the problem of visualization in intelligent planning systems via a more general approach. It consists in an integrated ontology set and reasoning mechanism for multi-modality visualisation destined to collaborative planning environments. This framework will permit organizing and modeling the domain from the visualization perspective, and give a tailored support for presentation of information.

Neural gas sonification - growing adaptive interfaces for interacting with data
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
In This work we present an approach using incrementally constructed neural gas networks to 'grow' an intuitive interface for interactive exploratory sonification of high-dimensional data. The sonifications portray information about the intrinsic data dimensionality and its variation within the data space. The interface follows the paradigm of model-based sonification and consists of a graph of nodes that can be acoustically 'excited' with simple mouse actions. The sound generation process is defined in terms of the node parameters and the graph topology, following a physically motivated model of energy flow through the graph structure. The resulting sonification model is tied to the given data set by constructing both graph topology and node parameters by an adaptive, fully data-driven learning process, using a growing neural gas network. We report several examples of applying this method to static data sets and point out a generalization to the task of process analysis.

This work discusses our project, which focuses on the new possibilities of methods of communication enhanced by digital networks. The aim of the project is to develop prototypes for a system with which the sense of existence of a person and others can be digitally shared and experienced (or digitally coexist) through tangible devices without the need to actively engage in the operation of such devices. While studies of ambient intelligence generally focus on the visualization or experience of ever-changing customized information, this project is more specific and looks closely at how one can recognize the existence of other humans in digitally networked remote places. The paper covers the conceptual and technical development of the project by demonstrating a number of prototype developments and a range of development tools utilized including a combination of Macromedia Flash and Director and Parallax's Basic stamp, which are easily available and accessible even for people with no technical background, such as the author himself.

This work introduces an information visualization component that appears as an additional window in an online collaborative e-learning environment, and can be used for viewing, browsing, editing and manipulating knowledge-based learning information through the LiveNet (http://138.25.13.210:8000/ln4-1) -a knowledge management and enterprise collaboration tool. This visual component employs a new visualization technique, called ENCCON (Nguyen and Huang, 2004), which uses a connection + enclosure layout method and a semi-transparency navigation mechanism to handle large scale of hierarchical learning information and it aims to provide a better assistance to the users of LiveNet for visual manipulation and navigation of knowledge-based data objects. The use of visualization techniques in LiveNet provides users with not only a 2D graphical visual interface for direct data manipulation, but also a set of clear views, the focus+context views, of the interrelations among the data objects which enhances the understanding of relational information that the users want to see. Although the proposed visualization technique ENCCON can be applied in many domains, we only concern its application in the domain of collaborative e-learning through the LiveNet.

2004
Most information visualization research and design is being performed in computer science and engineering labs by technically trained individuals. Within the digital arts and design communities, on the other hand, there is a parallel discourse regarding artistic visualization aesthetics and interaction design experimentation. Unfortunately, there has been limited exchange and collaboration between infoVis researchers and artists. This paper provides pointers to resources which can provide aesthetic and conceptual inspiration for visualization design in order to bridge the gap in visualization discourse between science, art, technology, and design. The examples given, intended to generate ideas for visualization metaphors and interaction models, are drawn from experiments in algorithmic art, architecture, artificial life, and the natural environment.

In order to be able to retrieve relevant information, the user still needs to be able to query the Web in an efficient way to exploit the full potential of semantic Web technology. This work describes an application design for using graphically represented ontologies for searching the (semantic) Web. One of the benefits of this approach is that these queries can be translated to different query languages such as RQL(Broekstra and Kampman, 2001; Karvounarakis, et al., 2001), OWL (Heflin, 2003), XQL (Robie et al., 1998), etc.

Visualizing time-varying matrices using multidimensional scaling and reorderable matrices
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
We present a novel approach to visualize time-varying matrices. This approach is based on combining multidimensional scaling and the reorderable matrix method. An adapted version of multidimensional scaling which allows the construction of similarity plots for columns/rows of time-varying matrices is proposed. In addition, we have extended the reorderable matrix method to allow the visual exploration of time-varying matrix data in a tabular form for being able to verify the results of MDS and possibly discover new patterns in data. The benefits of our approach are illustrated by showing visualizations of sensitivity matrices generated during simulations of metabolic network models.

Color model based 3-D self-organizing map
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
The self-organizing map (SOM) is widely accepted as a data visualization and cluster model for its ability to map high dimensional data in a low dimensional output space according to the data's similar features. However, this mapping process is time consuming and a large amount of iterations are needed in order to increase the accuracy of the data representation. This work describes how to apply the RGB color model to the initialization of the SOM neurons. The major feature is that the distribution of the neurons is closely related to the data distribution during the initialization of SOM. Therefore the iterations are greatly reduced and efficiency and accuracy of SOM are much improved. To evaluate our approach against traditional approaches we have conducted an experiment. The initial results show that the color model based 3-D SOM is very promising in the practical application.

A combination of quantitative and qualitative maps in an evaluative bibliometric context
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
Maps of science provide visualizations of scientific knowledge domains by quantitatively grouping elements from scientific papers. In evaluative bibliometric studies these quantitative maps have proven a useful tool Representation schemes such as mental maps or cognitive maps provide a tool to structure qualitative reasoning about, for instance, strategies, learning and politics. A combination of bibliometric maps with these qualitative structures may provide new ways for attacking science-policy related problems using bibliometric data. A design is presented on how to create, visualize and use the correspondence between elements in both types of maps.

Visualization and 'auralization' of architectural design in a game engine based collaborative virtual environment
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
This paper describes the development of collaborative virtual environment (CVE) software based on a game engine to support the early stages of design in the context of architectural education. The precedent of narrative drawing technique in architecture is introduced. From this we position the use of a CVE as a means to explore design context in a manner that is not possible when using typical architectural visualization software. Outcomes from software trials are reported that establish the value of working in a real time environment where design iterations can be tested from multiple points of view, and the important role of 3D sound to evoke occupancy and materiality. Negative results are reported in relation to collaborative design functionality and a revised approach based on an integrated project database is described.

2004
Producing 3D character animation requires proper planning and the right tools; these include highly technical manpower and facilities. Our paper discusses a practical approach for producing 3D character animation namely motion capture (Mocap) and keyframe animation. This research is based on our experience utilising both multimedia applications at Faculty of Creative Multimedia, Multimedia University. We analyse the strengths and weaknesses of these two methods based on a set of experiments, followed by conclusions that serve as a set of guidelines for animators as they decide on the use of motion capture or keyframe.

A path based model for sonification

Recently researchers have been interested in non-visual forms of presentation. Sound, touch, smell, as well as vision can be used to depict information. One important medium is sound; it can encode information for the blind or partial sighted, used to display information when it is impossible to use a screen, and the hardware is cheap and widely available. Researchers have investigated sonifying various data sources with different data types and configurations. We present a novel path-based model that can be used to describe each of these different sonifications. In summary, the path dictates the sonification tour, the data is mapped into sound via a transfer function, and the quantity of information being sonified is determined by both the span and how the abstract path is registered to the data.

2004
The research discussed in This work focuses on the development of interactive methods to image and analyze the surface designs of cultural artifacts and the generation of new designs. The project is interdisciplinary and uses methodologies from aesthetic and cultural inquiry, mathematics and computer science. The results of the research are obtained by using a combination of tools, such as neural networks, pattern recognition techniques including edge detection, and pattern generating techniques such as shape grammars. The first phase of this research focuses on the analysis of Congolese Kuba cloth and Moroccan Zillij mosaics because each has a complete and complex surface pattern with very different characteristics. Our work has three main facets: the description of the geometric content of ethno-mathematical artifacts; the classification of this content; and the generation of grammatical rules for the creation of new designs based on the studied artifacts.

Integration of unsupervised clustering, interaction and parallel coordinates for the exploration of large multivariate data
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
Parallel coordinates are widely used in many applications for visualization of multivariate data. Because of the nature of parallel coordinates, the visualization technique is often used for data overview. However, when the number of tuples to be visualized becomes very large, this technique makes it difficult to distinguish the overall structure. In This work we present a novel technique which uses a classification approach, the self-organizing map (an unsupervised learning algorithm), to solve this problem by creating an initial clustering of the data. By initially only visualizing the resulting representational clusters, the inherited global structure can be shown. Using linked views and allowing the user to perform drill-down and filtering on these representations reveals the single data items without loss of context.

Interactive and seamless access to video content is facilitated by technology that is able to annotate and retrieve media data efficiently and automatically with the minimal human interventions. Media should be accessible by intended users quickly and independent of the database size, regardless of the homogeneous or heterogeneous nature of the delivery channels or the user computing platform. These requirements are driving research and development efforts in the European project BUSMAN; in which a system for efficient annotation, seamless delivery of and access to video components across heterogeneous channels is being developed. The BUSMAN system architecture is based on the needs and expectations of two types of users: content providers and end users. In this paper an overview of the BUSMAN system is presented and its main functionalities are described.

Implementation of the GOQL language
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
The Graphical Object Query Language (GOQL) is a graphical query language that complies with the ODMG 3.0 standard and runs on top of the o2 DBMS. GOQL provides users with the User's View (UV) and the Folders Window (FW), which serve as the foundation upon which end-users pose ad-hoc queries. The UV is a graphical representation of any underlying ODMG scheme. Among its advantages is that it hides from end-users most of the perplexing details of the object-oriented database model, such as methods, hierarchies and relationships. To achieve this, the UV does not distinguish between methods, attributes and relationships, it encapsulates the hierarchies and it utilises a number of desktop metaphors whose semantics can be easily understood by end-users. The FW is a condensed version of the UV and provides the starting point for constructing queries. We demonstrate the UV and the FW and discuss GOQL's system architecture, its various components and the way these components interact to generate the UV and the FW and to provide an ad hoc query construction mechanism. We also present the screen interface of the language.

An approach to 3D digital design free hand form generation
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
This work describes a method for direct free hand drawing of complex tri-dimensional surfaces, by moving 2 hands in space. The system tracks the movement of 2 lights in space using 2 Web cams. The lights (LED s) are attached to the designer's finger who watches the surface being drawn on a monitor. The user can draw any surface that can be described by the movement in space of a line of varying length, in any direction. The shapes generated can be imported by 3D Studio and then AutoCAD for later precise editing. The fundamental guidelines to this research were: (1) nonintrusiveness of the input and visualization devices, (2) wireless free hand drawing in 3D space, (3) instinctive interface and (4) exporting capabilities to other CAD systems. In conclusion this work argues that 3D design, based on free hand form generation, allows for an enhancement of the traditional creative process through spontaneous and immediate translation of a concept into 3D digital form.

Multiple Web search visualization using dynamic fields

2004
Web search process can be time consuming and frustrating due to the enormous amount of information available on the Web. Recently, Web spiders with information extraction techniques that analyze retrieved documents have been proposed. This leads to an extended search process in which hypertext structure is enriched with semantic annotations. As consequence graph visualization techniques must be up-to-date for a better understanding of modified results. In particular additional semantic information must be taken into account without forcing the user browsing through unnecessary documents. As a first attempt towards graph visualization for semantic crawling, in this work we describe an example of XML-based visualisation system that provides a semantic visualization by means of dynamic fields that are associated to each node.

Performance visualizations using XML representations

The intermediate representation (IR) forms the information exchanged among different passes of program compilation. The intermediate format proposed for extensibility and persistence is written in XML. In this way, the program transformations that were internal to the compiler become visible. The hierarchical structure of XML makes a natural representation for the abstract syntax tree (AST). A compiler can parse the program source into an IR, then output it as an XML document. Separated by orthogonal namespaces, other IRs are also presented in the same XML document, gathering program information such as dependence vectors, transforming matrices, iteration spaces dependence graphs and cache reuse distances. This XML document can be exchanged between the compiler and program visualizers for parallelism and locality.

Estimating the "mental image" for comprehensible rendering of 3D objects
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
We present a method for comprehensible nonphotorealistic rendering of 3D free-form objects. The objects are rendered using a small amount of lines such as silhouettes or hatching strokes. The lines are carefully placed to ensure the user would understand the structure of the rendered object correctly. The user's "mental image" of the object is estimated using simplified methods of computer vision, allowing 3D shape reconstruction from the rendered image. The difference between the original model and the estimated "mental image" is used as a feedback for refining the line placement. The process stops when the difference is sufficiently low, which means the users would understand the rendering sufficiently well despite its simplicity.

Information provenance and the knowledge rediscovery problem
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
Visualizations leverage innate human capabilities for recognizing interesting aspects of data. Even if users might agree on what is interesting about a visualization, the steps that they use in the knowledge discovery process may be significantly different. This results in an inability to effectively recreate the exact conditions of the discovery process, which we call the knowledge rediscovery problem. Because we cannot expect a user to fully document each of their interactions, there is a need for visualization systems to maintain user trace data in a way that enhances a user's ability to communicate what they found to be interesting, as well as how they found it. We present a model for representing user interactions that articulates with a corresponding set of annotations, or observations that are made during the exploration. Such ability is critical to addressing the knowledge rediscovery problem, and is a fundamental component for systems that must provide information provenance.

Using visual exploratory data analysis to find bias in option pricing models

2004
Options are amongst the most heavily transacted financial instruments in the world. This paper examines how the methods of visual exploratory tools, espoused by Cleveland (1993) can be used to analyze the residuals from conventional option pricing models (Black and Scholes, 1972; Black, 1976). Until recently, these models were believed to be unbiased (Rubinstein, 1985; Lajbcygier, 1999). With the aid of visual exploratory tools we see that options on the All Ordinaries share price index trading on the Sydney Futures exchange have persistent, systematic and significant bias. This is the first time that various statistically oriented visual exploratory tools have been used to analyze option residuals. We find that the analysis motivates the use of alternative option pricing methods.

Arc-coloring of directed hypergraphs and brick-coloring of walls
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
We define an arc-coloring for a class of directed hypergraphs, in such a way that any two arcs having either intersecting tails or the same head must be colored differently. We investigate the arc-coloring of non-overlapping hypergraphs, namely hypergraphs which can be represented by 2-dimensional adjacency matrices (walls). In particular, coherent walls of degree d - corresponding to interval hypergraphs of degree d - are shown to be optimally colorable in at most 2d - 1 colors. Such property is the first step toward the chromatic classification of coherent walls of fixed degree. As the main result in that vein, we settle the above problem for the degree equal to 2, by providing an enumeration of "essentially distinct" walls in terms of necklaces and beads.

By chance is not enough: preserving relative density through nonuniform sampling

2004
Dealing with visualizations containing large data set is a challenging issue and, in the field of information visualization, almost every visual technique reveals its drawback when visualizing large number of items. To deal with this problem we introduce a formal environment, modeling in a virtual space the image features we are interested in (e.g, absolute and relative density, clusters, etc.) and we define some metrics able to characterize the image decay. Such metrics drive our automatic techniques (i.e., not uniform sampling) rescuing the image features and making them visible to the user. In This work we focus on 2D scatter-plots, devising a novel non uniform data sampling strategy able to preserve in an effective way relative densities.

Previous studies about the use of 3D models for information search have not shown a clear advantage over 2D or textual user interfaces. This work describes an experimental study focused on initial overview and information browsing tasks, that we consider to be more adequate to take advantage of 3D exploration. To this end, a 3D explorer prototype was developed and tested by experimental subjects. The 3D usability evaluation provided interesting design concepts and feedback, while the statistical evaluation of results showed significant speed advantages over a more classic interface, and a good potential for future improvements.

2004
The network map of the London underground is often put forward as a good example of information visualisation. Certainly this style of metro map has been adopted in many cities to assist train travellers understand the various routes and network connections. This work reports on a preliminary investigation into the question: Can the metro map metaphor be adapted for effectively displaying more abstract knowledge? Four case studies are described that use the metro map metaphor for presenting abstract, interconnecting "trains of thought". These four case studies include using a metro map to summarise the ideas in a complex thesis, using a metro map to communicate a business plan, using a metro map as navigation aid for Web pages and using a metro map to assist university students understand a course structure. This work discusses the aspects of these abstract metro maps from an information visualisation perspective. Experiences learned from the case studies are used to introduce some issues and guidelines for using this metaphor to help people find their way through more abstract data.

Visualizing interdisciplinary citations to and from information and library science publications

2004
Empirical investigations of citations to and from 150 journal articles published in the field of Information and Library Science (ILS) has enabled cross-mapping of the interdisciplinary evolution of the field. The publications were randomly drawn in six years between 1975 and 2000, with 25 articles each from the selected years. ANOVA tests reveal that although raw counts of self- and extradisciplinary-citations are not significantly different by year, they are different depending on whether it is from or to ILS. Nearly 30 disciplines hold mutual citations with ILS, and Computer Science, Communication, Management Science, Education, and Psychology are among those highly impact disciplines. Visualization further depicts the clustering of the citing and cited disciplines. In general out-degree citations contain richer set of nodes than those of in-degree, but overall, the mapping of the interdisciplinary scope of the ILS field provides convincing evidence for the interdisciplinary nature of Library and Information Science.

Interacting with real objects in virtual space

2004
While much has been made of the potential of virtual reality, VR is one end of a spectrum. 'Augmented reality' requires that the virtual vision be accurately superimposed on the real, with matching shading, which remains a technical challenge, or that real objects are accurately located in virtual space. A step change seems now to be occurring in this latter. This paper reviews some of the opportunities and issues that are likely to arise from the use of new location and detection technologies in buildings and building construction, and in the virtual representation of the real-time movement and location of these objects. These new tools for remote monitoring and representation are just emerging from Pandora's Box. It is argued that standards are needed to ensure their proper use, and to ensure that the remote representation does not imply greater accuracy than can be measured.

Blending solids with approximate analytical solution to PDE

2004
Blending is an interesting subject in computer graphics and CAD. Although surface blending has been well studied, to our knowledge, solid blending remains a blank research area. In this paper, we develop a partial differential equation (PDE) based solid blending method where a vector-valued fourth order PDE together with some surface boundary conditions are involved. In order to solve the partial differential equation, we propose an approximate analytical method which satisfies all the boundary conditions exactly. Unlike surface blending which only gives the information on the blending surface, solid blending represents properly not only the external surface, but also the interior of the solid. Three examples are given in the paper to demonstrate the applications of the proposed method in solid blending.

We present human figure control software using vision-based human motion capturing. We have already developed core techniques for vision-based human motion tracking and motion synthesis. We have provided the first version software as an open source kit. In this work, we have developed the second version software with modified motion synthesis. Our software consists of the following software: the vision software (includes 2D blob tracking modules and stereo vision module) and the motion synthesis software (includes skeletal structure reconstruction from a limit number of 3D positions, i.e., physically simulated joint position estimator). This software can be employed for many real-virtual applications such as avatar based video conferencing, virtual human control, and 3D game consoles which need the user postures as input. Our software requires the following hardware: more than two firewire cameras for vision processing and more than one PC for vision processing, motion synthesis, and rendering. In our real-virtual system, this software is also employed for virtual object manipulation interface with augmented avatar representation.

Towards a language for talking about information visualization aimed at presentation on the Web
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Considering variety, quantity and quality of information presentations and representations on the Web two research directions emerge for us: the first one has to do with foundations of visual literacy, development of visual languages that will facilitate visual reasoning in more general setting than in problem solving and the other one has to do with the complexity of design process itself. These two directions are not separate, as visual reasoning is a fundamental attribute of design, it is a functionality inherent in visual representations, but has to be rendered by design. This implies a need for design principles whereby visual reasoning can be built into a visual representation, which in turn requires the identification of these sound design principles and a language for talking about them. In this study, we define some of the basic concepts like visual immediacy, visual impetus and visual impedance that may form the basis of the necessary vocabulary. We then discuss types of visual reasoning, extending the goal of visual reasoning from problem solving alone to a more generic goal that includes the kind of reasoning involved in visual metaphors, visual analogies, and visual associations, which all act as organizers of thinking. We then proceed towards trying to summarize, systematize and add new principles and guidelines towards better presentation of information for the Web.

We propose a method for the visualization of large graphs. Our approach is based on the calculation of a density function resulting from the application of a metric on the vertices of a graph. The density function is then filtered using a convolution, leading to a partition of the graph. The choice of an appropriate kernel for the convolution makes it possible to control the number of clusters, and their size. Our algorithm can be executed automatically, but the parameters can also be interactively fixed by the user. We applied the algorithm to the problem of legacy code extraction from inclusion relation of C++ source files and film sequence analysis. The metric used here is defined from Strahler numbers, which measure the "ramification" level of graph vertices.

ORRIL: a simple building blocks approach to zoomable user interfaces
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Zoomable user interfaces (ZUI) can help people perceive and interact with large collections of information. These large collections complicate the task of creating ZUIs. In this paper the ORRIL (Objects, Regions, Relations and Interface Logic) framework is defined and presented as a technique for aiding ZUI design and creation. ORRIL makes explicit the data that appears in a zoomable information space, while simultaneously emphasising the relationships between user actions and transforms of the data. This is important for modeling and clarifying the processes that occur within a ZUI application. From the perspective of an implementer it may be used as an underlying model when designing and implementing a framework for building ZUIs.

Gaze data visualization tools: opportunities and challenges
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
Addressing data visualization challenges typically involves applying lessons from visualization theory to inform design and implementation approaches. This process is shaped to a large extent by the availability of tools that are aimed at enabling visualization designers to focus on visualization design rather than on low-level software engineering. Recently, such tools have become powerful enough to be used effectively. We discuss the ideation process informing our design approach and describe the use of Macromedia Flash MX 2004 for the rapid prototyping of a gaze data visualization tool. We highlight selected gaze data visualization ideas to illustrate the most innovative aspects of our design. In particular, we explain our strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms that produce the summarizing visual constructs and why this is important. We introduce a new technique for visualizing gaze data for dynamic stimuli. The novelty of this approach is that it avoids the traditional frame-by-frame analyses typically carried out for such stimuli.

Task embedded visualisation: the design for an interactive IR results display for journalists
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
There is need for user-centred visualisation research to engage with the activity context, information needs, knowledge and abilities of target user-groups. With a focus on the work of journalists, we first argue for information-retrieval results visualisation as a suitable browsing framework for journalists' frequently ill-defined needs and high-recall searches. We then describe the design and rationale for a histogram-based visualisation for journalists. We also describe the integration of this idea within a system that structures searching as a two-step query-and-filter operation. This approach is intended to support initial exploratory browsing and refinement in a way that is sympathetic to the systematic focusing that naturally occurs during complex, unstructured task performance. Further, the use of an enduring 'base' results set is intended to encourage structural familiarity with the broader results and therefore to enhance navigation.

2004
Large collections of image documents are today accessible via communication networks. Cost effective retrieval of the wanted images needs convenient browsing tools. In this contribution a technique for image selection on the basis of key details is illustrated. The technique is useful for instance for assisted queries to digital artwork collections, tele-sensing images, aerial photographs, astronomic databases, etc. The basic feature of the method is the capability of detecting and locating anyway rotated details with reasonable computational costs. In this work a criterion for proper choice of detail reference points is illustrated.

MS-Taxonomy: a conceptual framework for designing multi-sensory displays
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
One important task that the designer of multi-sensory displays must perform is the comparison of displays designed for the different senses. Comparing designs for different visualisations is difficult enough but comparing a visual display with an auditory display, or haptic display is harder still. Yet the designer of multi-sensory displays would like to make sensible decisions about when to use each modality. This work describes the MS-Taxonomy, a classification of abstract data displays that is general for all senses. This allows the same terminology to be used for describing visualisation, sonification and haptic display designs. The classification of displays is hierarchical and describes multiple levels of abstraction. In software engineering terms the taxonomy allows a designer to consider reuse at both an abstract architectural level and also a more detailed component level. Thus design mappings can be discussed independently of the sensory modality to be used. This allows for exactly the same design to be implemented for each sense and subsequently compared or transferred between modalities.

There is now a growing awareness of the application of Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) technology in the domain of information visualization and computational simulation. As VR has matured, it is evident that this development of interactive technologies has impacted significantly on multidisciplinary areas such as science, education, art and entertainment. We present an experimental project to assist designers in the assessment of the colour of packaging design by using VRML technology. We include demonstrations of both the possibilities and limitations of such an approach in the design process.

Developing a graphical definition system for a spatial parser generator
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Spatial parser generators automatically generate a parser of visual languages by providing grammars. The grammar is specified using text. The grammar would be easier to understand if we used a figure to input the grammar. We describe an approach in This work that graphically defines grammar. Direct manipulation is used to define grammar in our approach, which helps the user understand the meaning. We implement the GIGA system, which enables the user to define the grammar by drawing figures. GIGA displays each element of a rule visually. The user can define the grammar easily and can understand the grammar visually. Moreover, GIGA outputs the defined visual system to a file written in CMC text form. The user can execute the system by inputting the file into Eviss.

The effect of shading in extracting structure from space-filling visualizations
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Shading information is extracted by the human visual system during the earliest stages of the object recognition process. While shading can enhance the visibility of structures, it can have a negative impact on the judgment of sizes of elements in a structure. In certain visualization systems the underlying hierarchical structure is not noticeably explicit, such as in space-filling techniques. We hypothesize that in such cases, shading can make the structure more explicit. In This work we report the results of a study comparing two space-filling visualizations: one with and the other without shading. Our results show that on structure-based tasks, users performed better with the tool when shading information was included than without. However we did not obtain statistically significant results to suggest that shading information degraded users' performance on tasks requiring comparison of local features such as file sizes. A subjective evaluation shows that users preferred interacting with the system when shading was available.

2004
Existing Web search systems have the following problems. They cannot show Web contents that are related to the keywords but do not match to them. And the relationship between contents is unknown. This makes continuous navigation between contents through keywords impossible. The purpose of this study is to solve these problems, as examined in terms of visualization of the search results and of the strengths of relationships between Web contents. The paper proposes some visualization models, it also describes the development of a Web search system. The system has the following functions: (1) reference based on the strengths of relationships between Web contents; (2) visualization of the relationships among Web contents; (3) continuous navigation between Web contents through characteristic keywords. By using the system, users can navigate on Web pages from different viewpoints.

We have proposed and developed a simple 3D authoring/presentation system for immersive virtual reality environments. Our system enables a user to create and edit presentation content both by using a 2D graphical user interface (GUI) on a PC desktop, and through direct manipulation by hand gestures in an immersive environment. The user can thus enjoy the advantages of both simple GUI operations on the desktop and efficient tuning of 3D layout by direct manipulation. The system exploits various features of 3D visualization including 3D nested structures, 3D graph structures for hyperlinks, and 3D depth for zooming or focus+context visualization. In other words, our system utilizes 3D virtual space to produce effective and interactive 3D presentations in immersive virtual environments.

This paper presents a methodology to create 3D visualization of discrete event simulation. This methodology connects discrete event simulation directly to 3D animation with its novel methods of analyzing and converting discrete simulation results into animation events to trigger 3D animation. Discrete simulation results are analyzed and displayed in a graph structure that reveals all possible sequences of simulation events. In addition, a 3D animation framework is constructed for the visualization of discrete simulation results. This framework supports the reuse of both the existing 3D animation objects and behavior components, and allows the rapid development of new 3D animation objects by users with no special knowledge in computer graphics. This methodology has been implemented with the software component technology. Results in an electronics assembly factory are also provided in the paper to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

A vision system for providing 3D perception of the environment via transcutaneous electro-neural stimulation

2004
The development of effective user interfaces, appropriate sensors, and information processing techniques for enabling the blind to achieve additional perception of the environment is a relentless challenge confronting HCI and sensor researchers. To address this challenge we have developed a novel 3D vision system that can enable the 3D structure of the immediate environment to be perceived via head mounted stereo video cameras and electro-tactile data gloves without requiring any use of the eyes. The electro-neural vision system (ENVS) works by extracting a depth map from the camera images by measuring the disparity between the stereo images. This range data is then delivered to the fingers via electro-neural stimulation to indicate to the user the range of objects being viewed by the cameras. To interpret this information, the user only has to imagine that the hands are held in the direction viewed by the cameras, with fingers extended, and the amount of stimulation felt by each finger indicates the range of objects in the direction pointed at by each finger. This intuitive means of perceiving the 3D structure of the environment in real time effectively enables the user to navigate the environment without use of the eyes or other blind aids. Experimental results are provided demonstrating the potential that this form of 3D environment perception has at enabling the user to achieve localisation and obstacle avoidance skills without using the eyes.

We describe an ordering of the vertices of a 2-dimensional torus and study the upper bound on the orderly broadcast time. Along with messy broadcasting, orderly broadcasting is another model where the nodes of the network have limited knowledge about their local neighborhood. However, while messy broadcasting explores the worst-case performance of broadcast schemes, orderly broadcasting, like the classical broadcast model, is concerned with finding a fixed ordering of the vertices of a graph that will minimize the overall broadcast time.

Extending the utility of treemaps with flexible hierarchy

Treemaps are a visualization technique for presenting hierarchical information on two-dimensional displays. Prior implementations limit the visualization to pre-defined static hierarchies. Flexible hierarchy, a new capability of Treemap 4.0, enables users to define various hierarchies through dynamically selecting a series of data attributes so that they can discover patterns, clusters and outliers. This work describes the design and implementation issues of flexible hierarchy. It then reports on a usability study, which led to enhancements to the interface.

Real-time visualisation within the Multimod Application Framework
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
This work gives an overview of real-time visualisation algorithms developed under the EC-funded project Multimod to support a novel paradigm for the virtual representation of musculo-skeletal structures. These algorithms are fully integrated into the Multimod Application Framework (MAF), an open-source freely-available software framework for the rapid development of medical visualisation applications. MAF is based on the visualisation toolkit (VTK) and other specialised toolkits, e.g. for image registration and segmentation, collision detection or numerical computation. MAF provides a range of high-level components that can be easily combined for rapid construction of visualisation applications that support synchronised views. The majority of algorithms available within the standard underlying MAF toolkits were frequently either too slow or too general for our purposes. We have thus implemented computationally efficient versions of existing algorithms, e.g. for surface and volume rendering, and more importantly, developed new techniques, e.g. for X-ray rendering and designing volume rendering transfer functions. To achieve interactive rendering we have employed a scheme for space partitioning. The emphasis is on exploiting the characteristics of medical datasets (e.g. density value homogeneity) but further utilising the hardware-accelerated capabilities of modern graphics cards. In this context, calculations are moved into hardware as appropriate while avoiding dependency on specialised features of particular manufacturers so as to ensure real code portability.

We illustrate our general method by visualizing drought and pollution areas.

This paper presents a new multi-level focus + context technique for visualizing and manipulating hierarchies which contain large number of leaves. Our technique uses an ordinary 2D hyperbolic tree browser to display the major structure of hierarchies while a 1D distortion-based fisheye menu is also used to assist the display of those sub-hierarchies containing large number of leaf nodes. This significantly solves the problem of inefficient use of the display space when a user navigates, using a hyperbolic tree browser, through a portion of the hierarchy containing a large number of leaves.

The synchronous mapping discussions: the effects of floor control in turn-taking and choice of argumentative representations

2004
Empirical findings on CSCL (computer support collaborative learning) indicate that argumentative activity and argumentative maps are essential tools in order to foster construction of knowledge and evaluation of information. The current study examined effects of an innovative Web tool that provides a graphical representation of synchronous discussion. Fifty-four grade 7 students from two classes participated in the study. The study tested the effects of: (a) the use of shapes (mapping) representing argumentative functions of the participants' utterances in discussions (e.g. claim, explanation and information) and the use of arrows that represent the connections between utterances; (b) turn taking within the discussion. We tested these effects on the number of relevant claims and arguments expressed, and on the number of chat expressions (e.g. such as nicknames and curses). The results indicate that even without any previous familiarization with tool, the combination of the use of shapes and arrows and of the control over turn taking invites students to express more relevant claims and arguments, and less chat expressions. However, the effect of the use of shapes and arrows was found more dominant.

A usability framework for the design and evaluation of an exploratory geovisualization environment

2004
The exploration of large geospatial data for finding patterns and understanding underlying processes is one of the challenges in geovisualization research. New methods are needed for effective extraction of patterns and appropriate visualization tools are necessary to support knowledge construction throughout the exploration process. Based on an approach to combine visual and computational methods, a visualization environment has been developed to support visual data mining and knowledge discovery tasks. This environment integrates non-geographic information spaces with maps and other graphics that allow users to explore patterns and attribute relationships. The development of the tool intends to facilitate knowledge construction using a number of steps that underline data mining and knowledge discovery methodology. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the design concept, an empirical usability testing is planed to assess the tool's ability to meet user performance and satisfaction. In this test, different options of map-based and interactive visualizations of the output of a self-organizing map (SOM) are used to explore a socio-demographic dataset. The study emphasizes the knowledge discovery process based on exploratory tasks and visualization operations. This paper describes the usability framework used to guide the design, and examines key aspects of the evaluation of such visual-computational environment.

The effect of a perceptual syntax on the learnability of novel concepts
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Language theorists argue that the reason why spoken language is acquired so rapidly is that we have an innate predisposition for understanding linguistic structures. Theories of perception also hold that there may be deeply seated mechanisms for decomposing visual objects and analyzing them into both component parts and the structural interrelationships of those parts. We propose the theory that diagrams that activate the mechanisms for structural object perception should be similarly easy to learn. This builds on previous work in which we have developed diagramming principles based on the theory of structural object perception. We call these geon diagrams. We have previously shown that such diagrams are easy to remember and to analyze. To evaluate our hypothesis that geon diagrams should also be easy to understand we carried out an empirical study to evaluate the learnability of geon diagram semantics in comparison with the well-established UML convention. The results support our theory of learnability. Both "novices" and "experts" found the geon diagram syntax easier to apply in a diagram-to-textual description matching task than the equivalent UML syntax.

In this paper we discuss the use of models of space in the building of mixed-reality systems. By model of space we mean a geometric or symbolic description associated with a physical space. We outline several types of model that exist, how they are surveyed and authored, how they are represented to the users and how they are supported by middleware and sensors. We show that systems often contain numerous models of space and we discuss the issues in maintaining or reifying assumptions about transformations between models. We illustrate these ideas by describing the implementation of a collaborative mixed-reality system that allows users to experience a museum in three modalities: physically colocated visitor with personal digital assistant guide, virtual reality visitor and Web visitor.

An event-based approach to visualization
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
Visualization of large data sets is a demanding task, especially if different users are interested in different aspects of the same data set. Today's visualization techniques often do not distinguish different aspects and thus visualize all aspects of the data, which leads to overcrowded and cluttered representations. Moreover, users are provided with information irrelevant to them. In this paper we describe an event-based approach for visualizing large data sets. The basic idea is to let users describe interesting aspects of the data by means of events and then adapt the visual representation of the data on occurrence of events. We present a formal description of events, assuming that the data are given in relational form. Furthermore, a model for event-based visualization is developed. A brief overview of an early realization of the model along with first visual results is part of this paper.

This work proposes a user-oriented approach as a basis for proper information visualization in the production automation area. A total consideration of the user consists of analyzing his tasks, context and profile.

The advantage is that the tasks can be distributed to several small and manageable agents. The long term objective is to develop a working platform for the user-oriented information visualization.

Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
When searching on the Web, users often reformulate their queries after viewing the results and viewing some of the pages. After one or two reformulations the user may implicitly realize patterns and relationships between the multiple search results. We believe that these patterns can be used to identify interesting results. We have developed the prototype Search Engine Similarity (SES) tool which explicitly visualizes the similarity between multiple searches. We describe an experiment to determine whether explicitly visualizing the relationships between multiple searches will let users browse more effectively. Our results show that explicit difference visualizations can enhance the search process for some tasks.

3D reconstruction of a region of interest using structured light and stereo panoramic images
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
Construction of 3D environments from photorealistic images is important for many industries, including virtual reality, games and tourism among others. Extensive work has been undertaken using multiple stereo vision systems and fusion processing to create full 3D virtual environments. To improve the efficiency and accuracy, a stereo panoramic imaging system is used. A 3D environment can be created by using two panoramic images from a one-shot camera system. However a whole 3D scene is not always required, so a system which reconstructs 3D data only in a region of interest has been developed. A new structured light projection system for region of interest reconstruction is presented and tested. Based on the experimental tests, conclusions have been derived for highlighting the advantages of the approach.

Mapping Medline papers, genes, and proteins related to melanoma research
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
What is the structure of the research reported on melanoma? How has it evolved over the last 40 years? Which parts of this research field are correlated with the study of genes and proteins? Are there sudden increases in the number of occurrences of certain gene or protein names, reflecting a surge of interest? How are genes, protein and papers interconnected via co-occurrence patterns? This paper aims to provide answers to these questions by analyzing a data set consisting of papers from Medline, genes from the Entrez Gene database, and proteins from UniProt. Word burst detection and co-occurrence analyses were both performed. The spatial layout algorithm VxOrd was applied to create the very first map that shows papers, genes, and proteins and their co-occurrence relationships. The results were validated by five domain experts leading to a number of interesting facts pertaining to structure and dynamics of the melanoma research field.

Automatic selection of attributes by importance in relevance feedback visualisation
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Relevance feedback visualisation (RFV) is a technique developed to visualise the feature values of returned results in a content-based image retrieval system that incorporates relevance feedback. RFV is used also to re-sort retrieved results according to user requirements, enable the interactive investigation of pertinent features and permit the discovery of otherwise unidentifiable trends in the dataset. When large numbers of features are involved, manually determining which feature attribute graphs are the most important can be a burdensome task. In this paper, a method for automatically sorting attribute graphs according to their significance in the search operation is introduced. The result is that features worthy of further investigation are immediately identified, the user interface is improved, and the CBIR system is made more effective.

2004
The aim of This work is to present how structural relationships among regions can be used in the context of a general merging algorithm based on texture. In Garrido and Salembier (1998) and Salembier and Garrido (2000) the notions of merging order, merging model and merging criterion were introduced for the creation of binary-partition-trees (BPTs). We extend this framework to syntactic features, representing geometric relationships between image regions, which are taken into account for the creation of the BPT. In particular, we perform structure analysis on the shapes and the spatial configuration of image regions. In order to test the syntactic features approach, a proof of concept has been carried out following a quasi-inclusion criterion.

Information flocking: time-varying data visualization using boid behaviors
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
This work presents a significant extension of the information flocking concept and algorithms originally presented by G. Proctor and C. Winter (1998). It introduces a novel way of visualizing time-varying datasets using the emergent characteristics of self organization and dynamic behavior simulation. The current prototype uses both spatial clustering and behavioral animation to represent temporal data similarities by simulating the time-varying evolution of dynamic datasets. Instead of presenting exact data values, the way how the data values change over time is being visualized. In addition, the current information flocking method is capable of visualizing short-term temporal events or long-term time-varying data evolutions by automatically generating different recognizable motion typologies. This research show how artificial life principles have been merged with the field of information visualization. Several aspects of the original information flocking algorithms have been improved to incorporate the real-time evaluation of continuous dynamic data value streams and to generate multiple stable, recognizable atomic as well as collective dynamic behaviors that reflect time-varying dataset changes and relative data value evolutions. The main information flocking principles are demonstrated through a visualization of historical stock market quotes.

Interactive, immersive visualization for indoor environments: use of augmented reality, human-computer interaction and building simulation

2004
We present an interactive gesture recognition-based, immersive augmented reality system visualizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets of indoor environments. CFD simulation is used to predict the indoor environments and assess their response to specific internal and external conditions. To enable efficient visualization of CFD datasets in actual-space, an augmented reality system was integrated with a CFD simulation engine. To facilitate efficient data manipulation of the simulated post-processed CFD data and to increase the user-control of the immersive environment, a new intuitive method of human-computer interaction (HCI) has been incorporated. A gesture recognition system was integrated with the augmented reality-CFD structure to transform hand-postural data into a general description of hand-shape, through forward kinematics and computation of hand segment positions and their joint angles. This enabled real-time interactions between users and simulated CFD results in actual-space.

New methods for visual information seeking through video browsing
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
In This work we introduce new approaches for visual information seeking in video documents. We argue that a discrete visualization of continuous media streams via static keyframes is not sufficient to fulfill all information needs and therefore additional, more interactive techniques are required. We extend the concept of elastic interfaces, which has been used successfully with discrete documents, by applying it to continuous data streams. In addition, we propose a different integration of the elastic browsing functionality called "elastic panning". A first usability test is presented in order to prove its feasibility and to highlight its main advantages, namely the ability to access any position within a file independent of its length, and the smoother visual feedback during navigation compared to a standard slider interface.

Web-based collaborative 3D information visualization tool

2004
The amount of data that must be collected for one to decide on a course of action, nowadays and in any field, is nothing if extraordinary. The three-dimensional graphic representation of data is a powerful tool for its analysis. And the possibility for interaction and browsing throughout these data makes this analysis much more interesting and productive. Nevertheless, one doesn't usually make a decision alone, and most tools are of a single-user nature, which jeopardizes the decision-making process, especially if those involved are distant from each other, geographically speaking. With a collaborative information visualization environment, it is possible to debate over the same data and change them if necessary, in real time, diminishing time and avoiding mistakes in the decision-making process. Therefore, this paper proposes a Web-based collaborative tool for data visualization using Java, EAI (external authoring interface) and VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language).

Inferring and visualizing social networks on Internet relay chat

Internet relay chat is a system that allows groups of people to collaborate and chat from anywhere in the world. Clearly defined by several RFC documents, it is arguably the most standard real-time chat system currently in use. This work describes a method of inferring the social network of a group of IRC users in a channel. An IRC bot is used to monitor a channel and perform a heuristic analysis of events to create a mathematical approximation of the social network. From this, the bot can produce a visualization of the inferred social network on demand. These visualizations reveal the structure of the social network, highlighting connectivity, clustering and strengths of relationships between users. Animated output allows viewers to see the evolution of the social network over time. Some novel ideas for future work are discussed, showing other useful applications of this system.

The results of two experiments undertaken to evaluate the influence of certain sources of additional depth information and degree of interface control are presented. The merits of stereoscopic displays and various cursor designs are also investigated. Results indicate that the benefits of stereoscopic displays do not significantly outweigh the benefits offered by increased control and additional positional information when performing simple object selection tasks in unprepared AR environments.

To help programmers debug visual programs, we propose an animated execution method with supporting functions to be used with the animated execution. The animated execution animates state transitions as the program is executed. To make it easy for the programmer to interpret the animation, it is displayed in a manner similar to the visual program. The functions are used to narrow the possible locations of bugs and to test fixed components quickly. We have implemented animated execution and the functions on 3D-PP, our three-dimensional visual programming system.

Keyboard encoding of facial expressions

The paper focuses on the development of a human-computer communication method which utilizes the user's typing skills to control the facial expression of a computer-generated 3D face. The method is based on the realization that the human face is a movable and deformable system with 26 degrees of freedom (the same number as the letters of the English alphabet). Therefore it is possible to create a parameterized graphical facial model confined to a set of 26 parameters each one controlled by a letter key. The method is an extension of the KUI technique (Adamo-Villani and Beni, 2004; Adamo-Villani and Beni, 2003) recently developed to encode hand gestures.

This (video-) paper describes a user interface concept, which facilitates browsing of comparably large amounts of information on small screens. The viewing concept is based on a visually optimized star field display (Ahlberg & Shneiderman 1994) and is introducing new concepts like liquid browsing (an expansion lens with pressure controlled magnetic force simulation), selection based filtering and representation manipulation, multimotion behavior tagging, (interaction-) transparent spaces and continuous state animation. All these create a very versatile information space with a liquid-like look and feel, which can be used in a very intuitive way, providing all the advantages of a mature interactive scatter plot and can easily be scaled to different screen sizes without any adjustment efforts. This paper focuses on visual design and interaction details and emphasizes the importance of the visual interactive quality for mobile information visualization.

This work discusses the relevance of architectural design towards the field of information visualization by showing historical and contemporary examples of built structures with encoded information. This overview should demonstrate that information visualization in three dimensional physical environments was already created throughout the history of architecture, even within different cultures. From these examples some design principles for spatial coding of information will be extracted that can be transferred to the field of information visualization. Additionally architectural principles are related to metaphors from different fields of knowledge.

Effective ways of organizing image descriptors is a critical design step of content-based image classification systems. Suitable descriptors are selected according to the problem domain for generating the feature space. Using several descriptors improves accuracy of representation but risen some challenges such as non linear combination, expensive computation and the curse of dimensionality. In This work an approach using a non parametric statistical test for effective dimensionality reduction is presented. The proposed method facilitates feature discrimination and keeps relevant information.

2004
People process information through multiple modalities and many studies have been done that show interaction among the auditory, haptic and visual modes. This paper reports on a correlation between the haptic property of roughness and each of the audio properties of pitch and loudness. There were four experiments: given a roughness, match a loudness level to it and vice versa and given a roughness, match a pitch to it and vice versa. Subjects showed a strong correlation in the first two experiments, associating louder sounds with rougher textures and softer sounds with smoother textures. They also showed, although not always in the same direction, a strong correlation between pitch (high/low) and roughness. Applications of this study are to multimodal user interfaces and to music cognition.

One aspect of non-visual visualisation is providing accessibility to diagrams for users with visual impairments. In this paper, we review the literature on diagrams and non-visual presentation in order to elucidate the issues involved in making graph based diagrams accessible using speech and non-speech sound. First we examine the nature, scope and uses of these diagrams. We then describe the nature of diagrams: how do diagrams differ from other representations; how do sighted readers read, understand, and extract information from diagrams; what cognitive processes do diagrams facilitate; and what factors affect how diagrams may be understood? After a comparison of visual with aural presentation we discuss the work presented by others in this field, particularly looking at their reasons for implementing how they do in light of our examination of visual comprehension. The paper concludes with a discussion of how these issues combine and conflict to influence requirements for interface design.

The DataManager presented in this paper allows the multimodal visualisation of heterogeneous data originating from the biomedical field and, more particularly, biomechanics. In the latter, the aim is to increase our understanding of the musculo-skeletal system, and to achieve this, numerous disparate data must be collected and combined. Previously, no software tool fully allowed such integration, but the DataManager and its development environment (the MAF) now provide an answer to that problem. This paper presents the current visualisation and data processing tools available from the DataManager. Its usefulness for research, educational and clinical activities will be demonstrated. The system developers hope that the data management mechanisms available within the software will stimulate data sharing between scientists and will encourage them to participate in enhancing the system by integrating their own software tools.

A novel image encryption scheme based-on JPEG encoding
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
Image encryption is a suitable method to protect image data. The encryption algorithms based on position confusion and pixel substitution change compression ratio greatly. In this paper, an image encryption algorithm combining with JPEG encoding is proposed. In luminance and chrominance plane, the DCT blocks are confused by pseudo-random SFCs (space filling curves). In each DCT block, DCT coefficients are confused according to different frequency bands and their signs are encrypted by a chaotic stream cipher. The security of the cryptosystem against brute-force attack and known-plaintext attack is also analyzed. Experimental results show that, the algorithm is of high security and low cost. What's more, it supports direct bit-rate control or recompression, which means that the encrypted image can still be decrypted correctly even if its compression ratio has been changed. These advantages make it suitable for image transmission over network.

Collision module integration in a specific graphic engine for terrain visualization
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
This paper presents the design and implementation of a collision management module. This module is part of a specific graphic engine that manages large size terrain data. This engine has been used for example in a Basque Country terrain demo with a database up to 2.5Gb and texture resolution of 1024x1024 (3mts/pixel). As data textures are increasing resolution it seems convenient to allow near-terrain navigations. This behavior makes more complex the collision problem while navigating a large database. The main purpose of this project is the integration of a new collision module without any remarkable decrease in the performance of the engine. This work comprises the following research topics: preprocessed collision data structure definition, collision data management algorithm in execution time, collision detection algorithms and collision response algorithm. It has provided more flexibility in the interaction of the engine with the user, and more realism overflying terrains.

Cluster validity indices for graph partitioning
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
The aim of graph clustering is to define compact and well-separated clusters from a given graph. Cluster's compactness depends on datasets and clustering methods. In order to provide evaluation of graph clustering quality, many different indices have been proposed in previous work. Indices are used to compare different graph partitions but also different clustering techniques. Moreover, some clustering techniques are based on index optimization. Indices can also be added as visual tips in graph layouts. Despite the importance of the subject, little has been done to unify the field. It results that many indices can not be easily compared or interpreted. In this paper, we provide a unified and synthetic view of indices used in graph clustering area and discuss them. We also propose several enhanced measures.

A haptic interface for dose planning in stereo-tactic radiosurgery

When planning a Leksell GammaKnife/spl reg/ treatment, dose planners place iso-centres of the irradiation field in such a way that a certain iso-dose surface conforms as closely as possible to a target, such as a tumour. Today this planning is done primarily in 2D, and the clinician places the iso-centres onto the current medical image. The images used are usually acquired by MRl, CT or angiography. In This work we investigate the use of interactive 3D visualization and haptics to perform the dose planning. In a pilot implementation we provide the user with a virtual environment with real-time graphics to visualize the target, surrounding tissue and iso-dose surfaces as well as an integrated graphical user interface. The overall aim of the implementation is to increase the efficiency and precision of the planning process by adding haptic feedback to represent various constraints and opportunities in the planning process and so guide the user to an optimal placement of the iso-centres. Preliminary feedback from potential users has been very positive.

Using MoneyTree to represent financial data

2004
Ambient information visualization normally does not reside on the screen of a desktop computer, but exists in the general environment, in the periphery of the user's attention. The aim is not only to provide useful information, but also to blend in with the surroundings and to be appealing to the eye. We use ambient visualization to represent financial data. Financial visualization is the practice of making large financial datasets into images. In comparison to the bland financial data, the visualization is easier for people to understand, especially as the image changes. We describe a research project that uses different images of trees to represent the real-time changes in stock prices and volume.

2004
This paper discusses the use of computer-generated animation (CGA) in a court of law, CGA is a way of visualising evidence or information for a particular case. In this paper, the case involves a fatal road collision. The concepts and methods under consideration described in this paper deal with the reliability and accuracy of CGA dependent upon the forensic evidence. The paper has five sections. The first explains the nature of animation and the distinction between animation and forensic animation. The second describes the general context of evidence, from a legal aspect. The third section analyses the correlation between evidence and knowledge, based on the theory of knowledge. The fourth section elucidates the reliability and accuracy of CGA based on the evidence that has been used to create the animation. The final section concludes the analysis by discussing whether a certain CGA is reliable and accurate enough to demonstrate an expert's opinion in a court of law.

Using 3D to visualise temporal data

Dynamic 3D models generated from historical, time stamped data provide opportunities for insights and understanding that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to gain in applications as diverse as the teaching and learning of history and the analysis of aerospace experiments. This paper describes how historical data in a temporal database can be used to generate dynamic 3D models expressed in VRML. The models include facilities to move back and forth in time, to hide or reveal groups of objects and their labels and to show the paths traced by individual objects as they move through space and time. The change of shape of objects over time can also be modelled. The tools described in this paper enable the user to create these 3D worlds automatically without needing to know anything about the underlying 3D modelling language employed.

The increasing size of protein data available in Internet databases demands new fast methods of visualization. This paper introduces a novel visualization technique for molecular ribbon structures. The method is based on Combined BReps - a mesh structure defining a combination of polygonal faces and Catmull/Clark surfaces. Our technique provides high frame rates when interactively moving through structures of highest complexity as well as high quality images when the viewpoint remains static.

It has been reported a fourth order partial differential equation is effective in solving surface blending problems. In this paper, we present a new approximate solution to the fourth order partial differential equation and apply it to a number of surface blending tasks. The approximate solution consists of two parts: a blended part of boundary functions is used to accurately satisfy the original boundary conditions that define the blending surfaces; and a bivariate polynomial with zeroed boundary conditions, which is used to minimize the error of the fourth order partial differential equation. Using the developed method, a number of examples are investigated to demonstrate the applications of the proposed method in surface blending.

Visualising Web visitations: a probabilistic approach

This paper presents a technique, the Quantum Web Field, designed to give an ambient visualisation of the current activity on a Web site. It uses the paths of past visitors to the site and a self-organising map to build a diffuse 'probabilistic' mapping of pages to cells in a 2D matrix, where highly traversed page-links tend to be closer to each other. The paths of current visitors appear as intelligible trails giving a sense of purposeful human activity rather than offering detailed analysis. The visualisation is not constrained by either the complexity or the number of pages in the site.

The advanced access to different databases by means of one single interface has become a critical and important requirement for most archives and content providers. This paper describes an application case for a system architecture capable of retrieving large and diversified contents by means of innovative networking and search engines based on the Qimera platform. The system is supposed to automatically select contents from different repositories, and making them available trough an interface which has editing tools for direct usage of the contents. The application is studied to be integrated into educational products delivering dynamic composite content by means of a simple and transparent user interface.

Representing hierarchies using multiple synthetic voices

2004
This work reports on ongoing work related to the representation of hierarchical structures using multiple synthetic voices. We manipulated three synthetic voice parameters, average pitch, pitch range and speech rate, to represent nodes in a hierarchy. We created hierarchies containing 10 nodes and three levels deep. A within-subjects design (N=12) was conducted to compare the effect of multiple synthetic voices to single synthetic voices for locating the positions of items in a hierarchy. Subjects were trained with the set of rules we used for constructing the multiple synthetic voices. In a node-finding task, participants identified the position of a previously listened-to node. Our results show that subjects recalled the nodes' positions in the hierarchy significantly better when the hierarchies were equipped with multiple synthetic voices than without.

Time-tunnel: visual analysis tool for time-series numerical data and its aspects as multimedia presentation tool
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
This work proposes a new data analysis tool called Time-tunnel. Time-tunnel visualizes any numbers of time-series numerical data as individual charts in a 3D virtual space. Through direct manipulations on a computer screen, the user easily puts more than two different charts overlapped together to compare them in order to recognize the similarity or the difference among those data. Simultaneously a radar chart among those data at any time point is displayed to recognize the similarity and the correlation among them. In this way, using Time-tunnel, the user can visually analyse multiple time-series numerical data through interactive manipulations on a computer screen. Time-tunnel has not only aspects as a data analysis tool but also aspects as a chart-based multimedia presentation tool because Time-tunnel also treats multimedia data, i.e., texts, images, sounds and movies, as additional information represented by tags located at any point of charts. The authors also describe the usefulness of Time-tunnel as a multimedia presentation tool.

In this paper we present method for finding similarities in a pair of three-dimensional objects. The method involves obtaining boundary cubes approximations to the two objects, see (Maple and Donafee, 2002). The boundary cubes algorithm is a modification to the well-known marching cubes algorithm of Lorensen and Cline (1987). Having obtained the approximations we can apply exact and inexact graph-matching algorithms to quantify the similarity between two objects. This paper considers methods for exact and inexact graph matching and provides novel and efficient algorithms for graph matching applied to boundary cubes representations.

How visual query tools can support users searching the Internet

2004
Visual tools have been developed to help users formulate advanced Internet queries. Users can control the query coordination process at the level of the individual search terms or at the level of the search engines to be consulted. This work addresses the usability issue of the level at which visual query tools can provide the greatest benefit to users searching the Internet. MetaCrystal and its Category View and Cluster Bulls-Eye tools are used to visualize the degree of overlap between the results returned by different query formulations or search engines. It is shown that certain types of similarity relationships between ranked lists give rise to unique visual patterns in the Cluster Bulls-Eye. The MetaCrystal toolset is used to show why visual query tools may provide greater benefits to users who want to coordinate meta searches rather than individual search terms.

Although augmented reality (AR) promises to provide valuable means for computer-aided surgery; the underlying technologies often create a cumbersome work environment that is inadequate for clinical employment. A great deal of research is still needed to develop comfortable and easy-to-use tools providing an augmented view of the patient and its main internal structures. We propose to develop an AR system for enhanced visualization of the liver that involves minimal annoyance for both the surgeon and the patient. The ultimate application of our system is to assist the surgeon in oncological liver surgery.

3D features of urban scenes are the most important basic elements, we present a method for extracting 3D features of urban scenes from ground-based laser range data. We give depth image representation, define vertical and horizontal scanline, and remove the invalid data including trees, cables, fences, cars, passers-by, outlies and so on. We employ local self-adaptive curve fitting to extract line segments from main architecture structures. We introduce virtual feature conception for the first time, which indicates some implying structure features of urban scenes. The approach described in this paper has been implemented and applied to create the reconstruction of urban scenes. Experimental results show it is suitable for not only modern buildings but also classical architectures.

In This work we describe MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) multicasting under a specific graph (graceful) labeling with the use of the specific multicast tree topology called caterpillar. The use of a caterpillar as the multicast tree is analyzed and compared with the other tree topologies under a multicast network metric. The labeling algorithm proposed uniquely assigns link labels based on the node numbering which in turn enables to give a sharp estimate to the time-to-live parameter and assists in choosing optimal selection of rendezvous points. The graceful code for the caterpillar has revealed an efficient method (G-trace) of the reconstruction of multicast tree topology which in turn to be used for maintainability and for the other purposes in the management site.

This work describes an approach for visualisation specification and retrieval, with the aim of supporting the reuse of visualisation design knowledge. For this purpose, the approach focuses on requirement abstraction, visualisation characterisation, mapping rules and visualisation retrieval. Requirement abstraction represents knowledge for problem understanding. Visualisation characterisation and mapping rules represent the design knowledge. Visualisation retrieval makes the knowledge reuse effective. The novelties include using generic features for the visualisation specification and proposing a vector model for visualisation retrieval.

Detecting and mapping thematic changes in transient networks

Research fronts are the forefront of a scientific field timely identifying emerging trends and abrupt changes in scientific literature is not only beneficial for users of digital libraries, but also instrumental for users to trace the movement of a research front. A research front can be seen as a dynamic and transient mapping from the state of the art to its immediate prior art - the intellectual base. Citation and co-citation analysis primarily focuses on the structure and dynamics of the intellectual base, information retrieval and related research mainly focuses on intrinsic properties of text documents. In this article, we describe a novel approach that enables us to detect and visualize the transient relationship over time. Temporal associations between content words connected to a surge of interest in scientific papers and high-impact articles in the intellectual base are identified and visualized as a time-variant network. We apply the approach to the detection of thematic changes over time in information visualization and research in terrorism.

It is speculated that the processing of different types of information (e.g., quantitative, ordinal, or nominal data) will be affected by what type of visual display is used to present that information (e.g.. line graphs, shapes with varying levels of gray saturation, or shapes of different colors). People are expected to be able to more efficiently and accurately process and answer questions about the visual displays if the type of display (i.e., the representing dimension) provides neither too much nor too little information and matches the type of information (i.e., the represented dimension) being processed. In the present study we found that in general task performance was best when the represented and representing dimensions match. An exception to this is discussed.

Two-channel technique for high dynamic range image visualization

Advances in digital imaging technologies make increasingly available high quality images characterized by high dynamic range (HDR) of color components. Usual display devices are unable to visualize the information content of HDR images, especially in presence of light. For this reason special compression techniques for image rendering on conventional displays have been developed. In this work, a new technique based on simultaneous compression of low frequency radiance variations and detail enhancement is presented. In this work, a method working in the transform domain of an edge oriented wavelet transform is presented. Low-frequency components and high-resolution wavelet coefficients are separately manipulated before image reconstruction in order to reduce the overall dynamic range. The effectiveness of the technique is shown by means of significant examples.

Visualization with hierarchically structured trees for an explanation reasoning system

2004
This work is concerned with an application of drawing hierarchically structured trees. The tree drawing is applied to an explanation reasoning system. The reasoning is based on synthetic abduction (hypothesis) that gets a case from a rule and a result. In other words, the system searches a proper environment to get a desired result. In order that the system may be reliably related to the amount of rules which are used to get the answer, we visualize a process of reasoning to show how rules have concern with the process. Since the process of reasoning in the system makes a hierarchically structured tree, the visualization of reasoning is a drawing of a hierarchically structured tree. We propose a method of visualization that is applicable to the explanation reasoning system.

In many applications the study of human movement using a computer vision and graphics techniques is very useful. One of these applications is the three-dimensional reconstruction of the structure of the human body and its movement using sequences of images and biomechanical graphics models. We present a whole and general system to study the human motion without markers but, in this case, we apply it to high-level competition disabled swimmers. This kind of study needs accuracy on the analysis and reconstruction of the person's body, therefore the virtual human (avatar) must have similar anthropometrical characteristics than the person who is doing the movement. We define a process to adjust the humanoid to the morphology of the person. It could be very laborious and subjective if done manually or by selection of points, but in this article we present a global human motion system capturing, modeling and matching a semiautomatic process between the real person and the modeled humanoid or synthetic avatar. Semiautomatic means that the computers propose the best matching from previous frames and the user can accept it or not. Once this process is carried out we are ready to analyze and represent the movements under study. It must be defined a specific set of parameter for every kind of sport. The study is adapted to specific sport activities, in our case swimming activities with an additional complexity: water occlusion and distortion. In these cases the adjustment process must be assisted by the computer using rules and models to help the expert user in correspondence tasks.

Using information visualization for accessing learning object repositories

Learning objects are entities that may be used for learning, education or training. Nowadays they are often stored in learning object repositories (LORs), such as the Ariadne Knowledge Pool System (KPS) as stated in E. Duval et al. (2001), Merlot and EdNa. Typically users can search for learning objects in those LORs by filling out an electronic form that enables them to compose Boolean combinations of search criteria. More research is needed on novel access paradigms to enable more effective and flexible access to these repositories. We investigate how we can use information visualization techniques for this purpose. We discuss the use of three existing information visualization techniques that we applied to the ARIADNE Knowledge Pool System (KPS).

Visualisation techniques focus on reducing high dimensional data to a low dimensional surface or a cube. Similar dimensional reduction is attempted in the so-called 'self-organising maps'. A number of techniques have been developed to visualise categories learnt by these maps through and exemplified by the term sequential clustering. An evaluation of the techniques is presented using the learning capability of the self-organising maps as a baseline for building systems that learn to visualise complex data.

The effective visual exploration of large and complexly structured, abstract data requires sophisticated and interactive visualization techniques. Development of these techniques is the major discipline in information visualization. On the other hand, visualization of geospatial data is an important topic in cartography. The necessity to combine expertise from both fields has long been commonly recognized. In this paper, some considerations on the combination of arbitrary multivariate data visualizations, focus & context interaction techniques and thematic map displays are discussed that will allow the efficient combination of established techniques from both information visualization and cartography.

An extended platter metaphor for effective reconfigurable network visualization
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
We adapt the Flodar (Swing, 1998) metaphor to visualize dynamic networks and present experimental results on the effectiveness of this approach. Dynamic reconfiguration of networks enable rapid optimization of performance of a network, however, it poses several management difficulties when user intervention is required to resolve complex routing problems. Our metaphor scales well for networks of varying size, addresses the cluttering problem seen in past metaphors and maintains the overall network context while providing additional support for navigation and interaction. We apply the metaphor to three dynamic reconfiguration management tasks and show how these tasks are visually represented with our approach. We conducted an experiment with network administrators and researchers as subjects. A good understanding of network conditions portrayed in the metaphor was achieved within a short period.

Visualization through differentiating reflection functions
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Conventional visualization media such as computer screens are inherently two dimensional, making them incapable of displaying true 3D volume data sets. By applying only transparency or intensity projection, and ignoring light-matter interaction, results will likely fail to give optimal results. Little research has been done on using reflection functions to visually separate the various segments of a MRI volume. We explore whether applying specific reflection functions to individual anatomical structures can help in building an intuitive 2D image from a 3D dataset. We test our hypothesis by visualizing fMRI activation data because it contains complex and different types of information making it a good candidate for our approach.

Interactive cluster analysis
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
One of the first questions we pose when we have a new data set to explore is: are there any obvious groupings in the data? These clusters reveal the structure of the data set and make the data easier to understand. Cluster analysis is a classic problem and there are many tools for it. The problem is that these methods often give conflicting and too fine-grained results for practical use. As well, they are accompanied with the danger of over-interpreting the data. Another drawback in these techniques is that they do not usually provide an opportunity for interactive exploration. We propose a simple user interface and method to interactively explore clusters in data sets. The method is based on a rapid dynamic query and it can detect both hierarchical and partitional clusters.

Evaluation of two principal approaches to objective image quality assessment
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.

2004
Nowadays, it is evident that we must consider human perceptual properties to visualize information clearly and efficiently. We may utilize computational models of human visual systems to consider human perception well. Image quality assessment is a challenging task that is traditionally approached by such computational models. Recently, a new assessment methodology based on structural similarity has been proposed. We select two representative models of each group, the visible differences predictor and the structural similarity index, for evaluation. We begin with the description of these two approaches and models. We then depict the subjective tests that we have conducted to obtain mean opinion scores. Inputs to these tests included uniformly compressed images and images compressed non-uniformly with regions of interest. Then, we discuss the performance of the two models, and the similarities and differences between the two models. We end with a summary of the important advantages of each approach.

Interactive analysis of event data using space-time cube
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
In exploratory data analysis, the choice of tools depends on the data to be analyzed and the analysis tasks, i.e. the questions to be answered. The same applies to design of new analysis tools. In this paper, we consider a particular type of data: data that describe transient events having spatial and temporal references, such as earthquakes, traffic incidents, or observations of rare plants or animals. We focus on the task of detecting spatio-temporal patterns in event occurrences. We demonstrate the insufficiency of the existing techniques and approaches to event exploration and substantiate the need in a new exploratory tool. The technique of space-time cube, which has been earlier proposed for the visualization of movement in geographical space, possesses the required properties. However, it must be implemented so as to allow particular interactive manipulations: changing the viewing perspective, temporal focusing, and dynamic linking with a map display through simultaneous highlighting of corresponding symbols. We describe our implementation of the space-time cube technique and demonstrate by an example how it can be used for detecting spatio-temporal clusters of events.

2004
This work intends to generalize given techniques in modeling semantic content according to the purpose of transferring them from industrial application scenarios to the requirements of design for all. User groups like deaf people assimilate information in a different manner than hearing ones. In (Burmeister, 2003) several requirements of deaf users of information visualization are described as a basis for barrier free technology. In this paper, the author wants to engross his thesis according to a project he is working for. In the project WIDE (Koch et al., 2002), two user groups /sub e/signers and engineers in industrial product design and development - have different views on the search results according their needs and interests. WIDE is an EU-funded project (IST-200I-34417).

2004
This work proposes a high-level augmented reality interface toolkit that allows the combination of audiovisual information with a real world environment in an easy and interactive way. The system is based on MFC libraries, OpenGL, OpenAL, Microsoft Vision SDK and the vision tracking libraries from the well known ARToolKit. Simple and cost effective hardware complements the software solution. This AR interface toolkit can be used as an exemplar for the development of other applications. Users can interact with the presented information in several different ways. Realistic augmentation is also supported such as soft and hard shadows, without sacrificing the overall efficiency of the system. To illustrate the feasibility of our AR interface toolkit a cultural heritage application for museum environments is briefly presented.

Imaging panel skew correction and auto-focusing in radiotherapy cone beam imaging
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Digital transducers, notably amorphous silicon panels, are being used in image guided radiotherapy. Using kilo-voltage X-ray sources panel transducers are providing cone beam volume reconstruction. Theoretical considerations show that even sub-degree skew can result in the wandering of projection points across many detector elements to produce serious blurring of the cone beam reconstruction away from the imaging isocentre. The importance of identifying and correcting transducer skew is highlighted and shown to be of potentially greater importance than mechanical flex. Radiographic imaging of a suspended radio-opaque test object is described for direct characterisation of skew. The results of skew correction by image processing are presented. The use of 'auto-focusing' grey level change detection algorithms in cone beam reconstruction images, following programmed incremental angular transformation of the projection profiles of a 'Rando' anthropomorphic phantom, is shown to have the potential for automating skew correction.

2004
Originally designed as a messaging application, email is now used for a wide range of functions. Email clients however have not progressed correspondingly to support users with email management. This work describes the design of EzMail, an email visualization tool that runs in conjunction with an email client and creates a multi-view interface to assist with email management. Our primary focus is to group and visualize messages as components of threads to provide contextual information and conversational history. We have developed visualizations for individual messages, message properties, and messages in a thread. Message annotation is incorporated, along with a capability for replying simultaneously to several messages. A small user survey and a user study provided information regarding users' management of their messages and threads, and a comparative evaluation of EzMail with respect to Microsoft Outlook.

Learning from architects: the difference between knowledge visualization and information visualization
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
This work focuses on an aspect which has been neglected, but which is decisive: the transfer of knowledge to different stakeholders; especially the transfer of insights derived from information visualization tools. In knowledge management, the transfer of knowledge is a core process, which can be improved by using our innate abilities to process visual representations. The potential of visualizations are manifold. But business managers miss a holistic framework on the use of visualization methods for information exploration and communication tasks. This paper analyzes how architects use visualizations to amplify cognition and to transfer knowledge. It introduces a mediating framework that brings together isolated research directions and defines the new research focus knowledge visualization. Knowledge visualization examines the use of visualizations for the transfer of knowledge between at least two people. We found that the new focus is decisive and has implications for researchers in information visualization and knowledge management.

Facilitating understanding of information visualizations: emerging principles and examples
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Summary form only given. The enthusiasm for information visualization has generated a wide variety of interesting tools for multi-dimensional, hierarchical, and other kinds of visualizations. However, some designs are readily accepted as understandable and useful, while others are perceived as confusing and useless. Controlled studies have begun to sort of some of the issues, but the insights of designers and usability tests are contributing interesting cognitive hypotheses for researchers and practical guidelines for developers. This paper offers examples of what works and what doesn't with a preliminary set of principles that might have wide applicability.

Non-traditional interaction environments for information exploration
Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on Information Visualisation, 2004. IV 2004.
None
2004
Summary form only given. Developments in technology are providing new opportunities for interaction techniques. A decade ago, virtual reality spaces became more readily available. This gave researchers the opportunity to experiment with physical movement and gesture as interface elements for data exploration and navigation in both physical and abstract information spaces. Subsequent developments in projector and camera technologies, and computer vision algorithms, have opened up possibilities for brighter work environments and optically tracked user interaction. Current trends in technology include robust wireless networks, a plethora of personal information access devices, and auto-identification technologies. Computing technology is rapidly becoming smaller and cheaper, suggesting that computing capability can be embedded throughout the physical world in which we live. As we populate a physical space with computing devices, we can create interaction spaces that are aware of our presence, aware of our activities, and proactive in assisting us with our tasks. This talk reflects on the ongoing evolution that moves us beyond traditional desktop computer interfaces towards smart interaction spaces.

Preface
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Information Visualisation 2005, IV05, is the ninth conference on the subject and aims to bring together scientists, artists and users from a cross-section of disciplines to present, review and exchange the latest ideas that relate to rich bounding of information and visualisation. The theme chosen for this conference is &#x0201C;To shift the focus developing to application&#x0201D; by introducing new symposia &#x0201C;Visualisation & Data Mining&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;Knowledge Visualisation&#x0201D;, &#x0201C;Process Visualisation&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;Design and Aesthetics in Visualisation&#x0201D; to the existing symposia. This forum advocates that a new framework for information visualisation will emerge from looking at information-rich disciplines like Humanity, Psychology, Sociology and Business rather than just science-rich disciples. To facilitate this belief, this conference has an opportunity to reflect on a number of cross-disciplinary areas. Joining us in this search are over 150 researchers who will share a chapter of their effort with their fellow researchers. Together, the papers collected here reflect the vibrant state of Information Visualisation and bring together researchers and artists participating from more than 30 countries around the world, allowing us to address the scope of this field from a much wider perspective. Each contributor to this conference has indeed added a fresh view and thought, challenged our beliefs and encouraged further our adventure of innovation. I am grateful to each one of you for taking the opportunity to share your invaluable work with us.

Polyrhythmic organization of coupled nonlinear oscillators
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
We study the rhythmic organization of coupled nonlinear oscillators. If oscillators with non-identical internal frequency are coupled, they generate a great variety of periodic and chaotic rhythmic patterns. Sonification of these patterns suggests their characterization in terms of polyrhythms: each oscillatory unit subdivides "measures" of equal or varying length differently. For the case of two coupled oscillators, the organization of these polyrhythms is exemplified as a function of the internal frequency ratio and the coupling strength. Some sonification strategies are presented which aid to detect complex rhythmic relationships between oscillators. The results may be of importance for the analysis of complex multivariate time series like human EEG.

User evaluations of interactive multimodal data presentation
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
A set of user evaluation studies were performed to test hypotheses about the efficacy and value of the use of sonification by itself and together with visualization to improve the process of interactive data exploration. Our results show that, in some cases, sonification yielded more accurate analysis results than visualization, and when combined with visualization, yield much better results than either one (visualization or sonification) yielded separately. That supports sonification as a valuable and promising tool that should be further studied as a complement to visualization systems.

MotionLab sonify: a framework for the sonification of human motion data
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Sonification of human movement offers a wide range of new kinds of information for supporting motor learning in sports and rehabilitation. Even though motor learning is dominated visually, auditory perception offers unique subtle temporal resolution as well as enormous integrative capacity - both are important features on perception of human movement patterns. But how to address the auditory system adequately? A sonification based on kinematic movement data can mediate structural features of movement via the auditory system, like polyrhythms of movement etc. And sonification of dynamic movement data makes muscle forces audible approximately. Here, a flexible framework for the sonification of human movement data is presented, capable of processing standard kinematic motion capture data as well as derived quantities such as force data. Force data are computed by inverse dynamics algorithms and can be used as input parameters for real time sonification. Simultaneous visualization is provided using OpenGL.

Mode independent interaction pattern design
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This paper proposes an approach for cross-modal user interface design using interaction patterns. A meta-domain is introduced in which the user interface can be designed without the determination of its realisation in a particular interaction domain. When fully described in the meta-domain, the user interface can be realised in different domains (visual, auditory, tactile etc) exploiting the strengths of each different mode to its maximum. The paper proposes a set of interaction patterns along with visual and auditory realisations. To prove the concept, a prototype was designed for a real-world application, Microsoft Explorer. An auditory display prototype was developed making extensive use of virtual audio environments for non-visual visualisation of objects in the Explorer interface, taking advantage of a spatial layout. The prototype was evaluated with visually impaired, blind and sighted computer users.

A comparison of visual and haptic object representations based on similarity
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Do we judge similarity between two objects to be the same using touch and vision? We investigated this using psychophysical experiments in which subjects rated the similarity between objects presented either visually or haptically. The stimuli were a family of novel, three-dimensional objects whose microgeometry ("texture") and macrogeometry ("shape") were parametrically varied. Multidimensional scaling of the similarity data was used to reconstruct haptic and visual perceptual spaces. For both modalities, a two-dimensional perceptual space was found whose dimensions clearly corresponded to shape and texture. Interestingly, shape dominated in visual space, whereas both shape and texture were important in haptic space. Furthermore, stimuli clusters were observed in this space, suggesting the emergence of category structure based on similarity relationships. The same category boundaries were confirmed in a visual free sorting experiment. This study reveals differences in object processing across modality and demonstrates an approach for analyzing such differences in multisensory visualizations.

Design of a pressure sensitive floor for multimodal sensing
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Visualization and knowledge of detailed pressure information can play a vital role in multimodal sensing of human movement. We have designed a high-resolution pressure sensing floor prototype with a sensor density of one sensor per square centimeter that can provide real-time information about the location of the performer on the floor as well as the amount of pressure being exerted on the floor. Hardware and software have been developed for detecting, collecting, transmitting and rendering a graphical representation of the pressure data gathered from the sensors. This prototype can be easily reconfigured to cover large floor areas, and integrates closely with video, audio and motion-based sensing technologies to facilitate robust multimodal sensing. In our demonstrations, we show that the system accurately captures and transmits pressure information, and we illustrate how this forms a basis for a variety of applications including use in rehabilitation, virtual reality, entertainment, and children activity centers.

Visualization and Visual Modelling for Strategic Analysis and Problem-Solving
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Strategic problem-solving is a complicated task that requires processing of large amount of information using theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Effective problem-solving requires fast and accurate comprehension and analysis of the issues surrounding the problem. There are several tools, techniques and frameworks that support strategic analysis and decision-making. This paper develops a framework to clarify the relationship between visualization and modelling, and offers a classification scheme for visualization and modelling tools and techniques with a perspective on strategic problem-solving.

The exchangeability of speech by cognitive metaphors
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This article proceeds the reports regarding the development of learning techniques for deaf people based on information visualization. It connects Piagets research about the use of symbol systems with contributions taken from cognitive linguistics concerning cognitive metaphors. On the one hand it is shown, that audible speech is only one of many ways to access abstract content. It is possible to exchange it by visualizations of cognitive metaphors which are a proper visual aid used in special languages. On the other hand, a demonstrator program for a knowledge editor based on cognitive metaphors is introduced. This editor may be a useful tool even for analyzing metaphors.

Seeing sound: real-time sound visualisation in visual feedback loops used for training musicians
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Musicians in training need to understand the sound they are producing in order to improve its deficient aspects. Verbal feedback from musical masters is the usual method used for attaining this understanding. However, using realtime sound visualisation as a complementary form of feedback allows the large amounts of data typical of real-time acoustic analysis to be employed within training. This improves the efficiency of the feedback loop normally present within musical training and pedagogy. The implementation and effect of such a system is discussed.

Reviewing the role of visualization in communicating and understanding forest complexity
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
In recent years, we have seen a great deal of expansion in our knowledge of forest ecosystems and the underlying management dimensions that support decision-making in this context. Forestry, much like other natural resource management disciplines, is faced with the challenge of integrating information from many different perspectives often with limited understanding of the basic principles of the multitude of specialized fields from which they are generated. This problem is only exacerbated when reviewing management options with diverse stakeholders such as statutory decision makers and the general public. This paper suggests that 3D visualizations can aid in mitigating these difficulties of communication and understanding forest complexity. Methods of visualizing forestry data hold promise in clarifying complex spatial and temporal relationships, for experts and lay people alike. This paper reviews issues of complexity raised by today's demand for sustainable forest management, and the potential of 3D visualization to address these issues, drawing on past and current research on visualization effectiveness and validity. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to develop effective visualization methodologies to expand our ability to explore, critique, and understand forestry data. Our hope is that this supports knowledge discovery and diffusion to effected communities in the face of underlying data complexity and often, a limited familiarity with the concepts and principles of forest management.

Recent R&D efforts for the U.S. Intelligence Community have been directed towards providing new information technology that better supports collaborative war-gaming and decision-modeling among expert teams so as to produce valid and reliable intelligence in a more-timely, less-costly manner. This paper describes Schemer, a Web service that provides knowledge validation and collaboration support to virtual panels of experts. Of particular interest is the way that Schemer uses visualization of knowledge distribution among panelists to motivate collaboration, with the goal of fostering greater consensus and knowledge-building, hence, better intelligence. Since an additional requirement for supporting virtual panels is incremental data acquisition from panel members, models must often be computed from incomplete data. The same visualization techniques for evaluating consensus formation and knowledge-building among panelist also prove useful for evaluating the impact of data imputation on model validity and reliability.

Identifying critical focuses in research domains
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2005
Citation analysis has been applied in various contexts for different purposes such as impact factors estimation, co-citation pattern analysis, community partitioning, and knowledge visualization etc. We employed graph theory and authoritative sources identification techniques, augmented with visualization tools to discover critical research focuses from the citation graph. The citation graph was built from data retrieved from the CiteSeer database via a querying robot. Two experiments were carried out to identify important research focuses from the citation graph with promising results. Established research focuses as well as new research focuses were successfully identified by the method we proposed and tried. Researchers new to a field may use this method to locate important literature in various fields, which in turn facilitates their learning and studying.

The VEPS project: planning information visualisation
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Information visualisation remains at the heart of the planning system. Yet the use of the WWW for planning purposes is a new and expanding area of research. A focus on planning procedures at different stages helps to recognise the difficulties inherent in planning, particularly the outcome of changes to the built environment and the importance of people's involvement in the process. Effective tools are required for citizen based participation and development of alternative proposals. This paper describes the basis for the coming three years of research in the 'virtual environmental planning system' (VEPS) project. VEPS proposes an open standard Web approach to enable citizens to view, analyse, interact with and respond to proposed changes, to comment and test their own alternative solutions. This approach, it is argued, needs to be based on an interactive three-dimensional virtual reality visualisation that allows the viewer to experience complex information without need for training.

Remote sensing, LIDAR, automated data capture and the VEPS project
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
There has been research into the 3D modelling of urban settings and landscapes since the early 1980s, initially, primarily for visual impact assessment, and more recently, for wider simulation and analysis. This paper discusses recent project work that has been examining how to minimise operator based digital 3D modelling of urban and rural environments, where remotely sensed data is available. The increasing availability of highly accurate LIDAR data offers these opportunities, but currently is not captured so often nor is yet a sufficiently extensive coverage that it can be relied on to keep VR analogues of real places up to date. This places increasing importance on developing an 'urban data fusion' of different types including: LIDAR; digital elevation models derived from radar altimetry and similar data (SAR interferometry); real-time video photogrammetry; and thus on standards. 3D models of proposed changes then need to comply with these standards as they emerge.

3D city models have a broad field of applications. One of these is the support of an interdisciplinary, participative planning process. Such a process is the aim of the INTERREG IIIB Project "virtual environment planning systems" (VEPS). To be able to build a system that integrates different data sources and formats it is necessary to have common interfaces and data standards. In this article, some of the modelling, data, and distribution standards for 3D city models are discussed.

Compiling 3D models of European heritage from user domain XML
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Europe has a unique heritage and culture that is largely hidden from its young people. New information and communication technologies present an opportunity to involve the young people of Europe in discovering this heritage and presenting it to others in an exciting, dynamic way. This paper describes early work on the INHERIT project which involves the development of a set of tools, data and structures to build and manage historical and three-dimensional models. This enables school and college students to share in creating and exploring distributed simulations of dynamic aspects of history, geography, economics, politics and other subjects closely associated with European citizenship. With the tools developed, it is envisaged that school pupils are able to add, for example, landscape, buildings, avatars and a range of other objects, to a virtual world that models the heritage of Europe. The tools are based upon XML technologies to structure and distribute data and X3D or VRML to display that three-dimensional data.

3D information visualization for time dependent data on maps
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The visual analysis of time dependent data is an essential task in many application fields. However, visualizing large time dependent data collected within a spatial context is still a challenging task. In this paper, we therefore describe an approach for visualizing spatio-temporal data on maps. The approach is based on two commonly used concepts: 3D information visualization and information hiding. These concepts are realized by means of novel embeddings of 3D icons into a map display for representing spatio-temporal data, and an integration of event-based methods for reducing the amount of information to be represented. Our approach is capable of visualizing multiple time dependent attributes on maps, and of emphasizing the characteristics constituted by either linear or cyclic temporal dependencies.

Visualizing time dependent semantics: an application to quantum algorithms
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
We have developed a visual syntax for representing concepts that are contingent on temporal properties (time-dependent semantics). A within-group (N=24) experiment was conducted to identify the representations that conveyed best a given semantic. We then applied our representations to the visualization of algorithms in quantum computing and carried out a second experiment (N=16) on subjects unfamiliar with the semantic concepts that were tested. The results show that our representations are intuitive and facilitate a good level of understanding of the algorithms.

3-dimensional display for clustered multi-relational parallel coordinates
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Analysing multivariate data is a difficult task. Extensive interaction with the data is often necessary and, hence, the analysis can be quite time consuming. In this paper, we introduce a method to allow the user to simultaneously examine the relationships of a single dimension with many others in the data. The single dimension can then be interactively changed to allow the user to quickly examine all possible combinations. This method is achieved by extending the standard parallel coordinate approach to a 3D clustered multi-relational parallel coordinate representation (CMRPC). To aid this method, we use a technique called relation spacing which is used to position the axes according to how 'interesting' the different relations are. We also propose a number of interaction techniques to further facilitate the analysis process.

Visualization for management of electronics product composition
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2005
There are some systems called supply chain management system or value chain management system that manages production. It is a powerful tool in normal cases, but in a problem such that some parts are out of stock, it can solve the problem only by simple solutions, like postponing shipping of the product because it does not have enough information about production and functions to use the various information. Our research is concerned with a system to integrate information about production and show a solution to help users to judge which way is better to solve the problem. We implemented a prototype system. It takes inputs of some information that were not integrated in one place in former systems, but distributed among systems, people, or sections. It shows a solution for a problem making use of the information integrated in the system. The solution comes as process of reasoning to help user to judge what is the best to do in the case. We also implemented the user interface to show the process of reasoning.

Automatic layout of project plans using a metro map metaphor
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
In this paper, we describe a tool to improve inter-functional communication of project plans by displaying them as a metro map. Our tool automatically lays out plans using a multicriteria system adapted for the application area. Previous studies have shown that displaying project plans using a metro map metaphor as a complementary visualization to Gantt charts attracts and engages individuals, presents an overview of detail and initiates discussions. Creating such a map manually is time consuming. Hence, we have developed a software tool that converts a standard planning format into a metro map visualization and assists designers in generating comprehensible layouts. Our findings may be important for researchers in the domain of human computer interaction, project managers, knowledge visualization and communication scientists.

Persistence through visualization in knowledge-intensive conversations

2005
This article confronts the discourse on persistence in mediated interactions to the one in face-to-face conversations and outlines various areas of development. We argue for distinguishing different kinds of persistence depending on the type of conversation and focus on graphic persistence of knowledge intensive conversations. In a second part, we describe specific requirements for conversational tools aiming to make the processes and the outcomes of knowledge intensive conversations traceable and correctible (i.e. persistent). In order to do so, two conversational tools are presented. Based on this presentation and referring to dialogue theory, we discuss requirements for applications that support two types of knowledge intensive conversations.

This publication presents a prototype visualisation system for navigation of encyclopedia articles based on knowledge maps connecting articles to each other. A turning table is used as a metaphor to depict a result set as a whole, while three-dimensional objects of various shapes placed on top of the table represent individual encyclopaedia articles. The system employs a number of depth cues to enhance spatial perception and uses depth-dependent semi-transparency of labels to avoid display cluttering. A concrete implementation for the German language "Brockhaus Multimedial" electronic encyclopaedia is presented and discussed.

Model-based analysis of Chinese calligraphy images
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Chinese fonts with smooth outlines and solid colouring have been produced for computer displays and printings for a long time. However, the aesthetic properties of the characters produced by calligraphers could not be simulated with these methods. Ip and Wong proposed a parameterised brush model that enables efficient generation of Chinese calligraphic writings such that the rendering is scalable in resolution and it allows high quality publishing. While this graphical model facilitates the synthesis of calligraphy writing given a set of writing parameters, for the inverse problem, a lot of user stroke manipulation is required to regenerate the model parameters given a calligraphic image. Consequently, an intelligent method is required to automatically determine the model parameters from images of Chinese calligraphy. This paper describes a methodology for automatically estimating the set of 3D geometric and dynamic writing parameters along a stroke trajectory from images of calligraphic writings.

Color edge enhancement based fuzzy segmentation of license plates
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The area of automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) offers a big scope in numerous applications and a lot of techniques have been proposed. Most of the techniques work under restricted and supervised conditions. The proposed ALPR technique consists of two main modules: plate locating module and plate segmentation module. In the initial stage, search is being made for a prospective license plate on the basis of some of the local features contained in its fuzzy geometry. The second module utilizes a fuzzy C means based clustering over the finalized plate-patch to cluster the eight-connected components in it into desired and undesired regions. Segmentation proceeds only over the cluster containing the desired plate regions. In the experiment on locating license plates, 852 images were taken at various backgrounds and conditions. Of these, 10 images failed to locate the license plates; the rate of success was 98.82%. Experiments for character segmentation were carried out on the remaining 842 plates. Of which, 39 plates were not properly segmented; the success rate was 95.36%. The combined rate for the two phases of our license plate identification algorithm is 94.24%.

A system for sign language recognition using fuzzy object similarity tracking

2005
As a part of natural language understanding, sign language recognition is considered an important area of research. The applications of such a system range from human-computer interaction in virtual reality systems to auxiliary tools for deaf-mute to communicate with ordinary people through computer. A great deal of research is done so far but fewer researchers have extended it to Arabic sign language recognition. In this paper, we have presented a system that performs vision based isolated Arabic sign language recognition using hidden Markov models together with EM algorithm for parameters estimation. An approach to track hands in subsequent frames is proposed using a fuzzy object similarity measure based on a number of geometrical features of hands. Moreover, we have used the centroid of the signer's face to centralize the body coordinates instead of fixing the signer's position or using position tracker device. The overall accuracy of the recognition task is 98% over a dataset of 50 signs including single hand and two-handed signs.

Adaptive dissection based subword segmentation of printed Arabic text
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2005
Numerous segmentation and recognition techniques have been proposed in literature for Arabic OCR system. Correct and efficient segmentation of Arabic text into characters is considered to be a fundamental problem. While OCR systems for other languages do not need segmentation for printed text for successful recognition, it is essential to design robust and powerful segmentation algorithms or employ segmentation free recognition schemes for printed Arabic text. Even more, in recognition of handwritten characters, segmentation is considered to be indispensable. Most of current segmentation technique suffers from over segmentation and under segmentation in addition to not being adaptive in nature. In this paper, we have proposed a new sub-word segmentation scheme, which is independent of font size and font type.

Modern 3D motion capture systems allow large amounts of data to be recorded from patients with walking difficulties. However, it often proves difficult for clinical staff to interpret this data to gain insight into the patient's condition. Automation and simplification of the analysis of gait data is therefore necessary if it is to be used more productively. In this paper, we have developed visualisation software that helps direct clinicians to the relevant parts of the data, simplifying analysis and increasing insight.

2005
An approach of employing information visualisation to develop systems that facilitate instructors in Web-based distance learning is presented here. The paper describes a tool, called CourseVis, that uses multidimensional student tracking data collected by CMS and generates graphical representations that can be used by instructors to gain an understanding of what is happening in distance learning classes. The work followed a systematic approach that started from collecting the instructors' needs, produced some appropriate graphical representations of student tracking data, and evaluated the effectiveness, efficiency and usefulness of the proposed representations. The evaluation has shown that with CourseVis the instructors can identify tendencies in their classes, quickly discover individuals that need special attention, and are able to provide better support to their students.

Hierarchical navigation interface: leveraging multiple coordinated views for level-of-detail multiresolution volume rendering of large scientific data sets
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2005
We present a new hierarchical navigation interface for level-of-detail selection and rendering of multiresolution volumetric data. The interface consists of multiple coordinated views based on concepts from information visualization as well as scientific visualization literature. With key features such as brushing and linking, and focus and context, it gives the users full control over the level-of-detail selection when navigating through large multiresolution data hierarchies. The navigation interface can also be integrated with traditional level-of-detail selection methods for more effective visual data exploration. We test the utility and effectiveness of this hierarchical navigation interface on a couple of large-scale three-dimensional steady and time-varying data sets.

This is a report of course efforts in exploring and visualizing shapes made by movements. A pedagogical attempt was made to visualize forms made by transition. The forms were made by 3D scans of body movements in playing tai chi and by applying a "stitch" or "blend" function between two profiles. These exercises showed the result of form which was originally difficult to comprehend in a virtual world. A rapid prototyping (RP) tool was used to build the models to clarify the modeling process and details. The exercises contributed to a valuable pedagogical experience in communicating design concepts between students and instructor.

Quantitative comparison between the use of 3D vs 2D visualization tools to present building design proposals to non-spatial skilled end users

Information technology in construction (ITC) has been gaining wide acceptance and is being implemented in the construction research domains as a tool to assist decision makers. Most of the research into visualization technologies (VT) has been on the wide range of 3D and simulation applications suitable for construction processes. Despite its development with interoperability and standardization of products, VT usage has remained very low when it comes to communicating and addressing the needs of building end-users (BEU). This paper argues that building end users are a source of experience and expertise that can be brought into the briefing stage for the evaluation of design proposals. It also suggests that the end user is a source of new ideas promoting innovation. In this research a positivistic methodology that includes the comparison of 3D models and the traditional 2D methods is proposed. It helps to identify "how much\

The effect of animated transitions on user navigation in 3D tree-maps
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This paper describes a user study conducted to evaluate the use of smooth animated transitions between directories in a three-dimensional, tree-map visualization. We looked specifically at the task of returning to a previously visited directory after either an animated or instantaneous return to the root location. The results of the study show that animation is a double-edged sword. Even though users take more shortcuts, they also make more severe navigational errors. It seems as though the promise of a more direct route to the target directory, which animation provides, somehow precludes users who navigate incorrectly from applying a successful recovery strategy.

Learnability of interactive coordinated-view visualizations
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This paper examines the human computer interaction issue of learnability of interactive coordinated-view visualizations. We take the case of DataMaps, a census data visualization tool intended for a general audience with a huge percentage of novices. Usability tests conducted on DataMaps revealed three main kinds of problems that novices faced: they could not make strategic selections of coordinated visualizations according to a given task, they lacked familiarity with the nature of the attributes, and there were several misunderstandings of visual syntax and interaction widget usage. We outline design features which are desirable for novice-friendliness: Task based organization of coordinated views to enable strategic selection of views to suit the task, data centric approach to familiarize novices with data, self disclosure of visual syntax features and interaction mechanisms by the interface. The design should be such that they can smoothly transition from being a novice to expert. We examine how these principles may be applied to DataMaps to re-design it for "novice-friendliness".

Exploring highly structured data: a comparative study of stardinates and parallel coordinates
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Comparing different information visualization (InfoVis) techniques is a challenging task and a necessary step to reach the users and their tasks. We evaluated the effectiveness in visualizing psychotherapeutic data of two InfoVis techniques, namely the stardinates and the parallel coordinates by a comparative study with 22 participants. Based on three research questions we interpret the results of our study in order to derive statements on both visualization techniques. We evaluated (1) the time participants were engaged in testing our material; (2) the number of correct answers; (3) subjects' statements, which were categorized by the type of statement; and (4) the subjects' key statements in comparison to those defined by an expert. Our empirical results indicate that the stardinates are a more appropriate method for interpreting such highly structured data in detail whereas parallel coordinates show advantages for gaining information at the first glance.

Multidimensional visualization of transition systems

2005
Transition systems are graphs and it is natural to consider their visual representation as a graph visualization problem. They also pose an interesting multidimensional visualization challenge since every state may be considered as a point in n-space. We discuss a number of approaches toward projecting transition systems to the 2D plane by considering the dimensionality of the states. To assess these techniques, we consider their ability to assist us in answering questions that are difficult to address with conventional methods.

A new force-directed graph drawing method based on edge-edge repulsion
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The conventional force-directed methods for drawing undirected graphs are based on either vertex-vertex repulsion or vertex-edge repulsion. In this paper, we propose a new force-directed method based on edge-edge repulsion to draw graphs. In our framework, edges are modelled as charged springs, and a final drawing can be generated by adjusting positions of vertices according to spring forces and the repulsive forces, derived from potential fields, among edges. Different from the previous methods, our new framework has the advantage of overcoming the problem of zero angular resolution, guaranteeing the absence of any overlapping of edges incident to the common vertex. Given graph layouts probably generated by classical algorithms as the inputs to our algorithm, experimental results reveal that our approach produces promising drawings (especially for trees and hypercubes) not only preserving the original properties of a high degree of symmetry and uniform edge length, but also preventing zero angular resolution. By allowing vertex-vertex overlapping, our algorithm also results in more symmetrical drawings.

Representation of graphs on a matrix layout
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2005
The need to visualize network data becomes increasingly crucial, as it appears in numerous domains like Web visualization, computer network monitoring, or social studies. Graphs and matrices are two well-known techniques to visualize network data. Depending on which task has to be carried out on the data, each of them offers complementary useful properties. This paper describes an attempt to combine some advantages of both techniques within a single representation. The proposed visualization, called Mat 'Graph, is based on the adaptation of a graph to fit a matrix layer. This approach provides a new trade-off between advantages and drawbacks of both techniques. The matrix-based adapted graph has been used to visualize electronic message interactions.

Asynchronous circuit design shows many similarities with software design. This is due to the modular construction style associated with asynchronous circuits, where each asynchronous module can be designed as a standalone object communicating with other modules. We propose a visualisation system for asynchronous circuit design tools, based on clustered graph visualisation and coordinated views. The novelty of our approach is to apply classical software visualisation techniques to a hardware environment and take advantage of properties specific to our asynchronous design flow. This system is based on a control and data flow graph representation of the asynchronous circuit compiled from a high-level description by a syntax-directed transparent process and transferable to the final hardware circuit by a direct synthesis process. Compared to software compilation flows, this transparent design flow offers opportunities for visualisation, with representations at different stages being easily mapped onto each other to combine their visualisation qualities. Each representation also exhibits properties based on some physical attributes of the final hardware circuit, allowing us to render some abstract properties on top of real-world-based ones. This paper shows how the handshake circuit graph is used as the underlying structure onto which properties extracted from other structures are mapped, and then how this structured graph is used as the central piece in a coordinated views environment. These visualisation techniques have been exercised by designers optimising the design of a fully asynchronous ARM processor.

Visualizations of symbols in a horizontal multiple viewer 3D display environment
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
In this paper we present a visualization environment for collaborative and co-located displays of geospatially related data for command and control. We first describe the working principle of a novel horizontal display that is aimed at providing high resolution stereoscopic 3D visualizations simultaneously to a group of up to four observers. This display environment opens up new ways to present view-dependent visual content within a shared workspace. For this environment we propose frontoparallel presentations of conventional symbols that are 3D presentations of 2D symbols which appear virtually oriented towards the line of sight of the observer. In an experiment we compare frontoparallel symbols with flat symbols i.e. symbols that are presented in the horizontal plane of the display. The results of our study indicate that frontoparallel symbols in a stereoscopic view are perceived and identified faster than symbols presented flat in relation to the plane of the display.

Visualising sentiments in financial texts?
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
An information extraction system that extracts 'sentiment' words in unrestricted Arabic texts is described. Earlier work on the automatic sentiment analysis in English and Chinese texts has been adapted and extended to the morphologically richer Arabic texts. A method for automatically and unambiguously extracting sentiment-bearing patterns from texts in Arabic is described. A list of sentiment words is provided and sentiment bearing excerpts are extracted from time-stamped news wire: The frequency of sentiment words per unit time is then plotted for 'visualising' changes in sentiments.

Digital concept mapping in learning contexts: integrating knowledge, arguments and information resources
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Students who self-regulate their study have to cope with an increasing amount of increasingly complex knowledge and information. This is particularly true for students in resource-based scenarios. Visualization tools may assist students in the easy and effective orientation of the status of their knowledge, as well as the access to knowledge elements and task-relevant knowledge resources. Most existing tools focus on the visualization of knowledge, arguments, or information only. It is claimed that concept mapping may function as a bridging technology. This paper analyses the potential of advanced digital concept mapping tools for visualizing knowledge, arguments, and information resources in an integrative and comprehensive manner. Structural, representational, processing and usability features of concept mapping are outlined. It is suggested that digital concept mapping may be used for effectively managing individual knowledge and knowledge resources in resource-based learning.

In this paper we examine the metaphorical face of knowledge visualization and weave our observations into a wider perspective. We discuss a fundamental, but less scrutinized, precondition: the interrelation of metaphor, linguistic learning, and mediation of knowledge through visualization. By presenting preliminary thoughts on this interrelation, we wish to avoid the risk of simplification within this new field of research and to provide a potential theoretical foundation.

Scalable virtual viewpoint image synthesis for multiple camera environments
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
One of the main aims of emerging audio-visual (AV) applications is to provide interactive navigation within a captured event or scene. This paper presents a view synthesis algorithm that provides a scalable and flexible approach to virtual viewpoint synthesis in multiple camera environments. The multi-view synthesis (MVS) process consists of four different phases that are described in detail: surface identification, surface selection, surface boundary blending and surface reconstruction. MVS view synthesis identifies and selects only the best quality surface areas from the set of available reference images, thereby reducing perceptual errors in virtual view reconstruction. The approach is camera setup independent and scalable as virtual views can be created given 1 to N of the available video inputs. Thus, MVS provides interactive AV applications with a means to handle scenarios where camera inputs increase or decrease over time.

Physics-based animation of a trotting horse in a virtual environment
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
In this paper we describe the implementation of a physics-based animation of a trotting horse in real-time. The horse is modelled as a collection of connected bodies using the open dynamics engine library to simulate gravity. The animation is created by comparing the current state of the horse with a desired state and applying torques proportionally to the errors present between the two. The desired state is obtained from frames of video footage of a trotting horse. P-controllers are used to minimise the error between current and desired angle positions as well as global positioning and orientation of the horse's trajectory. Results show realistic movement patterns as compared to the video footage and realistic ground reaction force patterns of each individual leg.

A vision-based augmented reality system for visualization interaction
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This paper presents a vision-based video see-through augmented reality (AR) system for 3D interaction with volumetric data. Traditional desktop system and fish-tank virtual reality system are basic choices for volume visualization application which give the user limited interaction capabilities. AR provides a new scheme of 3D interaction between human and computer. We have integrated optical tracking and hardware accelerated volume rendering components into a video see-through AR system framework. It presents the user with a more natural environment for interactive visualization task, which is different from the traditional visualization system. Rich 3D experiences and efficient interaction with scientific data have been achieved by the user through this system. This prototype is an appropriate platform to investigate issues of 3D interaction with volumetric data and to build further complex interactive application.

The collision problem appears within many fields. The specific characteristics that can be identified in different problems lead to the broad set of specialized algorithms that appear in the literature.

Curve approximation with quadratic B-splines
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
A curve approximation technique using quadratic B-splines is presented in this paper which automatically computes data points to minimize errors. This technique can be useful for efficient storage of geometric shapes in any graphic or CAD applications. The computed data points are the control points and knots of approximating quadratic B-spline curve rather than simple interpolants. Curve approximation is a three step process, involving computation of initial data points from the opening angle plot of given curve, new knot(s) insertion at appropriate location and error minimization by changing knot positions. The algorithm is simple, efficient and robust to any curve model. Demonstrated results show that even higher degree polynomial curves can be approximated with very few data points with reasonable accuracy.

Relevance vector machine for content-based retrieval of 3D head models
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
In this paper, we propose a novel 3D head model retrieval approach in which the queries are 2D face views instead of less readily available 3D head models. The basic idea is to characterize the corresponding relations between 2D view feature and 3D model feature based on a machine learning approach. Thus the subsequent feature matching can be carried out in 3D feature space. As an effective solution to regression problems, relevance vector machine is used in this paper to establish an association between 2D and 3D features. Experimental results show that our proposed 2D query based method is comparable with the direct 3D query based one.

Object recognition and tracking using Bayesian networks for augmented reality systems
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
One of the major problems in augmented reality (AR) is tracking and registration of both cameras and objects. These tasks must be done accurately to combine real and rendered scenes. In particular, the initialization of the object tracking often remains manual in most systems. This paper proposes the use of Bayesian networks to perform the object recognition and initialization of the tracking. By recognizing the object, special points are taken and we use this information to create generic markers around the scene. Then, an algorithm for pose estimation based on the AR-toolkit library is used to find the orientation of the real object to allow the registration process for 3D objects.

From form to content: using shape grammars for image visualization
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The idea of superimposing geometric grids on images to visualize their content is not new. Leonardo Da Vinci used it, Durer used it, and Descartes pioneered the use of geometric grids to describe geometric content with algebraic equations. Shape grammars take the algebraic analysis of images to a new dynamic level. They permit the visualization of images in terms of construction processes: generators and relations, in the language of algebra. In this paper, we discuss some of the creativity involved in the identification of initial objects and rules for the analysis of both a Zillij mosaic and a Kuba cloth. We show that although conceptually similar, the processes are quite different for the two types of design. While Zillij mosaics are regular, Kuba cloths also involve scaling: the variation of the size of repeated sub-patterns within a defined space.

Diagramming design: visualizing user interactions with colour palettes
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This is a partly practical, partly theoretical paper regarding the uses and potential uses of capturing and visualising digital design moves. The paper-based sketch consists of ambiguous marks that evidence shifts in creative thinking over time. When the artist or designer uses digital technologies to design, only final polished digital marks remain at the end of a session. The processes by which the final design occurred are invisible. This paper presents visualizations of task-based and highly constrained design activities such as colour selection to indicate what can be learned by visualizing mechanical design processes. By visualizing how student designers move across two different designs of colour palette both artistically and empirically interesting results are found. Visualizing design moves enables the design researcher to discover patterns within design behaviour, enables the usability researcher to test interface usage, and enables the designer to create images with aesthetic potential through process alone.

Liquid 2D scatter space for file system browsing
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This (video-) paper describes a user interface concept, which facilitates multidimensional visual queries, filtering and browsing of the file system at the same time by means of the "liquid scatter space" (LSS) concept (Waldeck, 2004). The UI concept is based on an advanced star field display (Ahlberg & Shneiderman, 1994) using liquid browsing (Waldeck, 2004) and selection based (sketch-) queries. It allows realtime search and browsing at the same time (integrated into one single user interface) and can visualize the most important file system meta data dimensions simultaneously: 1. filename; 2. creation/modification date; 3. filesize; 4. filetype; and 5. label. LSS provides very fast and easy visual data mining possibilities for the desktop and makes it possible to perceive complex dependencies between the most important file system meta data properties at a glance. It also overcomes the "hidden-deep-down-in-hierarchy-structures"-problem by making it possible to use folders for structuring but not being bound to them. This paper focuses on visual design and interaction aspects and emphasizes the importance of paying regard to visual interactive details for information visualization and interaction interfaces and the need of making it easy to use.

PlanningLines: novel glyphs for representing temporal uncertainties and their evaluation
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Dealing with temporal uncertainties is a key issue in domains like project management or medical treatment planning. However, support for temporal indeterminacies is not very well integrated in current methods, techniques, and tools. In this paper, we present a visualization technique called PlanningLines that allows for representing temporal uncertainties and aims at supporting project managers in their difficult planning and controlling tasks. We conducted a controlled experiment to gather empirical evidence on the strengths and limitations of our approach. Main results are that PlanningLine users make fewer mistakes and are faster in conducting tasks than users of a traditional visualization technique.

Meaning metaphor for visualizing search results
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
While searching the Web, the user is often confronted by a great number of results, generally sorted by their rank. These results are then displayed as a succession of ordered lists. Facing the limits of this approach, we propose a prototype to explore new organizations and presentations of search results, as well as new types of interactions with the results in order to make their exploration more intuitive and efficient. The main topic of this paper is the processing of the results coming from an information retrieval system. Although the relevance depends on the result quality, the effectiveness of the result processing represents an alternative way to improve the relevance for the user. Given the current expectations, this processing is composed by an organization step and a visualization step. Then the proposed prototype organizes the results according to their meaning using a Kohonen self-organizing map, and also visualizes them in a 3D scene to increase the representation space. The 3D metaphor proposed here is a city.

Adaptive site map visualization based on landmarks
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Site maps are frequently provided on Web sites as a navigation support for Web users. The automatic generation of site maps is a complex task since the structure of the data, semantical and layout aspects have to be considered. One main problem is a concise presentation of site maps since the data to be displayed is usually extensive. The focus of this article is a new method to offer concise site map presentations to Web users by adaptation of site maps to landmarks and search queries. By landmarks we denote important data objects in a Web site, that are determined by information retrieval (IR) methods and used to simplify the Web site graph such that a layout may be generated efficiently. Adaptation of site maps to user queries provides personalized maps that reflect the part of a Web site that is relevant for a specific user. By these means the fraction of the Web site is visualized efficiently as a site map that is adapted to the specific needs of a user. In contrast to previous approaches, the landmark presentation provides a concise view of a larger Web space, which may be applied to disambiguate search results.

Visualizing natural language description is a difficult and complex task. When dealing with the process of generating images from natural language descriptions, we firstly should consider the real world and find out what key visual information can be extracted from the sentences which represents the most fundament concepts in both virtual and real environments. In this paper, we present the result of a prototype system called 3DSV (3D Story Visualiser) that generates a virtual scene by using simplified story-based descriptions. In particular, we describe the methodology used to parameterize the visual and describable words into XML formatted data structure. Then we discuss how to interpret the parameterized data and create an interactive real-time 3D virtual environment.

Ontology learning methods aim to automate ontology construction. They are complex methods involving several elements such as documents, terms and concepts. During the development of an ontology learning method, as well as during its deployment, several situations occur where understanding the relations between these elements is crucial. Our hypothesis is that visual techniques can be used to aid this understanding. To support this claim, we present a set of such complex situations and describe the visual solutions that we developed to support them.

Digital preservation of cultural heritage sites has become a global problem. The paper proposes a real 3D digital method for culture heritage sites using 3D laser scanners and CCD cameras. Firstly, we preprocess the laser scans for noise removal and hole filling. Next step is using an improved ICP algorithm we present step-by-step registration to align all range scans into a common coordinate system. And then, we proposed a filtering of 3D data compression and use a volumetric-based algorithm for the construction of a coherent 3D mesh that encloses all range scans. Finally, through texture mapping, we obtain real 3D and real texture models. The example of the construction of the 3D model of buildings and grottos are presented.

Modeling 3D scanned data to visualize the built environment
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Capturing and modeling 3D information of the built environment is a big challenge. A number of techniques and technologies are now in use. These include EDM, GPS and photogrammetric application and also remote sensing applications. In this paper, we discussed 3D laser scanning technology, which can acquire high density point data in a accurate, fast way. Therefore, it can provide benefits for refurbishment process in the built environment. The scanner can digitize all the 3D information concerned with a building down to millimetre detail. A series of scans externally and internally allows an accurate 3D model of the building to be produced. This model can be "sliced" through different planes to produce accurate 2D plans and elevations. This novel technology improves the efficiency and quality of construction projects, such as maintenance of buildings or group of buildings that are going to be renovated for new services. Although data capture is more efficient using laser scanner than most other techniques, data modeling still presents significant research problems. These are addressed in this paper. The paper describes the research undertaken in the EU funded (FP6 IP) INTELCITIES project concerning 3D laser scanner technology for CAD modeling and its integration with various systems such as 3D printing and VR projection systems. It also considers research to be undertaken in the EU funded (INTERREG) virtual environmental planning systems (VEPS) project in the next 2 years. Following this, an approach for data modeling of scanned data is introduced, through which the information belonging to existing buildings can be stored in a database to use in building, urban, and regional scale models.

On two properties of the minimum broadcast time function
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Broadcasting is the problem of dissemination of information in which one piece of information needs to be transmitted to a group of individuals connected by an interconnection network. A widely accepted communication model for this problem is the 1-port, constant model, in which a node of the network can transmit the message only to one neighbor at a time, and the transmission time is constant, regardless the length of the message. Finding an optimum strategy for broadcasting under this model, such that this process is accomplished in minimum time, has been proved to be NP-complete for an arbitrary network. If we model the interconnection network as an undirected graph, the minimum broadcast time function associates to each vertex an integer which represents the minimum time necessary to broadcast the information stored in that vertex to all other vertices. The values of the minimum broadcast time function are known for a very restricted class of graphs, mainly regular ones, and very little is known about this function in general. In this paper we explore two new properties of this function. The first property establishes a connection between this function and the behavior of the optimal broadcast schemes. We prove an exact result for trees and we conjecture it for arbitrary graphs. The second property establishes a connection between this function and the density of the graph.

A framework for visualising large graphs
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Visualising large graphs faces the challenges of both data complexity and visual complexity. This paper presents a framework for visualising large graphs that reduces data complexity using the clustered graph model and provides users with navigational approaches for browsing clustered graphs. A key design task of such a system is to define a strategy for generating logical abstractions of a clustered graph during navigation. An appropriate abstraction strategy should represent a clustered graph well and avoid visual overload. The semantic fisheye view of a clustered graph is proposed for such a purpose. Two case studies were investigated, and the experiment results show that during navigation the first-order fisheye view of a clustered graph conserves visual complexity at a constant level.

Estimating the traffic on weighted cactus networks in linear time

A communication network can be modeled by a graph with weighted vertices and edges corresponding to the amount of traffic from sources and expected delays at links. We give a linear algorithm for computing the sum of all delays on a weighted cactus graphs. Cactus is a graph in which every edge lies on at most one cycle. The sum of delays is equivalent to the weighted Wiener number, a well known graph invariant in mathematical chemistry. Complexity of computing Wiener polynomial on cacti is discussed.

A graph theoretic algorithm for placing data and parity to tolerate two disk failures in disk array systems
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
In recent years commercial redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) systems have become increasingly popular because of their enhanced I/O bandwidths, large capacities and low cost. However, the continued demand for larger capacities at low cost, has led to the use of larger arrays with increased probability of random disk failures. Hence the need for RAID systems to tolerate two or more random disk failures without sacrificing performance or storage space. In this paper, we devise a novel graph-theoretic method for placing data and parity in an array of N disks (N /spl ges/ 3) to enable its recovery from any two random disk failures. We first provide an algorithm for the case when the number of disks N = P - 1, where P is a prime number, and then generalize the solution for any arbitrary N. We also determine the fraction of space used for storing parity in an array of N disks employing our algorithm, and show that this fraction has the optimal value of 21N for all N = P - 1. For illustration, this fraction and the percentage of its difference from the optimal ratio are graphed for values of N between 5 and 255. Finally, we describe a method for determining the data-blocks from where the reconstruction of two failed disks can be started in such an array.

Visualization of self-stabilizing distributed algorithms

2005
In this paper, we present a method to build an homogeneous and interactive visualization of self-stabilizing distributed algorithms using Visidia platform. The approach developed in this work allows to simulate the transient failures and their correction mechanism. We use local computations to encode self-stabilizing algorithms like the distributed algorithms implemented in Visidia. The resulting interface is able to select some processes and incorrectly change their states to show the transient failures. The system detects and corrects these transient failures by applying correction rules. Many examples of self-stabilizing distributed algorithms are implemented.

A new approach is proposed to motion editing based on motion capture data, i.e., motion mapping. The key to our framework is the spacetime optimization method based on physical model. For reducing the complexity of optimization problem, we map the captured motion to a new character by using a simplified model. This model is a transformation tool and determined automatically by using the motion analysis technique. The motion mapping process includes three sub problems of motion retargeting. In order to further speed up the procedure for finding the numerical solutions, we describe an efficient method to find an appropriate initial solution for the optimization process. Results show that physically realistic animation can be created with our mapping algorithm.

Motion data correction and extrapolation using physical constraints
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Optimization techniques have proven to be a powerful approach for generating new motions. In this paper, we present a physically based optimization method to synthesize motions by using motion capture data as input. We assume that the captured motion data is physically plausible. We start by defining and estimating the physical properties of human characters. The procedure of motion synthesis is from coarse to fine according to the objective function and physical constraints. Our motion synthesis is like a motion editing method, which is appropriate for motion correction and extrapolation. By this means, we can correct and eliminate unrealistic motion data.

Visualisation techniques for users and designers of layout algorithms
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Visualisation systems consisting of a set of components through which data and interaction commands flow have been explored by a number of researchers. Such hybrid and multistage algorithms can be used to reduce overall computation time, and to provide views of the data that show intermediate results and the outputs of complementary algorithms. In this paper we present work on expanding the range and variety of such components, with two new techniques for analysing and controlling the performance of visualisation processes. While the techniques presented are quite different, they are unified within HIVE: a visualisation system based upon a data-flow model and visual programming. Embodied within this system is a framework for weaving together our visualisation components to better afford insight into data and also deepen understanding of the process of the data's visualisation. We describe the new components and offer short case studies of their application. We demonstrate that both analysts and visualisation designers can benefit from a rich set of components and integrated tools for profiling performance.

Visualization of biological patterns in event detection and tracking based on SRP algorithm
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The goal of this paper is to provide a temporal visual structure, which helps in easy identification of the amount of information the story adds to the event in an event detection and tracking task. The strength of the event is calculated each time the story arrives and is plotted in a visual structure. The relationship of the story with an event is found applying a biological species interaction approach towards the incoming news stories and events. The biological model proposed in this paper helps in classifying the story type by considering the interaction among the species as relationship with the events. The fitness score of the story to the event is calculated using SRP algorithm. This score together with the relation type helps in calculating the strength of the event, which is used to plot on a temporal visual structure. There is a combined display of archive events with the present stories which gives a clear view of the importance of news in the stories.

3D information visualisation: an historical perspective
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The use of 3D visualisation of digital information is a recent phenomenon. It relies on users understanding 3D perspectival spaces. Questions about the universal access of such spaces has been debated since its inception in the European Renaissance. Perspective has since become a strong cultural influence in Western visual communication. Perspective imaging assists the process of experimenting by the sketching or modelling of ideas. In particular, the recent 3D modelling of an essentially non-dimensional Cyberspace raises questions of how we think about information in general. While alternate methods clearly exist they are rarely explored within the 3D paradigm (such as Chinese isometry). This paper seeks to generate further discussion on the historical background of perspective and its role in underpinning this emergent field.

Participation in European Union research projects now requires the setting-up of a project Web site. This paper discusses the creation of the "Matrix" to facilitate the information visualisation of a project; experiments, data, and results, etc, i.e. information far beyond the promotional details of the Web site. The paper describes the theory of such an endeavour before proceeding to discuss the practical realities for this case study project. Finally, we consider any lessons that can be learnt from this real-world application.

Semantic traits of graphical interfaces to support human scheduling
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Three semantic traits are considered central in the design of interfaces for scheduling: (1) expressive richness, (2) dependency constraints and (3) global homogeneity. These traits are exploited by diagrammatic representations that 'structurally integrate' systems of domain relations through analogous systems of diagrammatic relations. These traits are discussed in relation to ROLLOUT - a prototype representational system for bakery planning and scheduling. This article provides a semantic evaluation of ROLLOUT in terms of these representational traits and proposes explanations of how these traits lead to increased cognitive support in scheduling activities.

Enhancing 3D file search with landscapes and personal histories: exploring the possibilities of TerraSearch+
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Most users today have difficulty locating files due to memory, i.e., an ability to recreate the personal history of where they placed the document in the first place. Microsoft XP search provides the standard file search functions according to human semantic memory. However, depending exclusively on this human system for file acquisition can be problematic and very limiting for users who perform well in 3D space. The prototype system utilizes three-dimensional environments that are augmented with second-order information that depicts the relationships between the first-order properties by a visualization system. This system maintains user trace data in a way that enhances their ability to locate files according to place, time, and content. Early results of cognitive walkthroughs and questionnaires indicate users could more easily find files through search tools, but that unfamiliarity with the interface could be a barrier to acceptance.

Applying visualisation techniques in novel domains
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The visualisation of large information collections is a common problem which has been extensively researched in many domains. Several application domains still exist, however, where visualisation techniques have not been adequately researched or applied. The aim of this paper is to discuss research into visualisation tools for two such areas, namely genealogical information systems and network application management. Genealogical information systems are concerned with providing facilities for storing and browsing family information. Network application management is concerned with providing facilities to manage the performance of network application services. Whilst these two domains are vastly different, the visualisation requirements are very similar. This paper shows how the interactive visualisation tools developed can be used to facilitate effective exploration and browsing of this information.

Smart and physically-based navigation in 3D geovirtual environments
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This paper describes an approach for smart and physically-based navigation, which aims at supporting effective and intuitive user interactions with 3D geovirtual environments (GeoVEs). The approach is based on two aligned concepts: 1) All navigation techniques are controlled by constraints that ensure user orientation and avoid "getting lost" situations. 2) All navigation techniques are handled in a time-coherent way achieving steady, continuous user movements using a physically-based motion model. Based on these concepts, we demonstrate several ways to improve commonly used navigation techniques for geovirtual environments.

MAPVIS: a map-projection based tool for visualizing scalar and vectorial information lying on spheroidal surfaces
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
In this article, we present a novel fast algorithm dedicated to the visualization of scalar and vectorial information lying on elliptical surfaces. As the geometry of the data is simple and not relevant, and inside structures are meaningless, standard visualization methods appear to be not well adapted to our context. Our algorithm is based on map projections, good candidates to unroll elliptical surface around a region of interest, without being computationally prohibitive. It has the merit to project, on a 2D cartographic reference, different views of scalar, as well as, vectorial 3D information lying on the surface. We display results for synthetic and cell wall simulations data.

Challenging conventions for geovisualization interface design: implications for exploratory data analysis
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The use of interface metaphors and cartographic guidelines for facilitating communication between cartographer and user may serve to limit the power of the system or the representation for a diverse set of users or a diverse set of uses. For example, the data exploration tasks typical of geovisualization systems may be hindered by strict adherence to conventional and/or traditional interface metaphors or cartographic symbolization. Successful design of geovisualization systems, therefore, should take into account factors that are socially and culturally determined and adjust design accordingly dependent on the targeted users or, more importantly, the targeted task (i.e. exploratory data analysis). This paper explores this possibility and presents the results of a pair of human-subjects experiments where some subgroups among the participants were shown non-traditional representations. Results indicate that, for data exploration tasks, designers and users should embrace unconventional designs in order to encourage creative problem solving and hypothesis generation.

Applying graphical design techniques to graph visualisation

2005
This paper contains details of new criteria for graph layout, based on the concepts used in graphical design. Current graph layout criteria have been shown to be effective in measuring the quality of a graph layout, but they are ad-hoc and often miss subtle appearance considerations such as balance and distribution. We discuss how the principles concerning the layout of text and diagrams from design can be applied to graph layout and show how two new metrics can be implemented based on these criteria. We also give preliminary examples of layout generated using the new metrics.

A novel efficient algorithm for determining maximum common subgraphs
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Graph representations are widely used for dealing with structural information. There are applications, for example, in pattern recognition, machine learning and information retrieval, where one needs to measure the similarity of objects. When graphs are used for the representation of structured objects, then measuring the similarity of objects becomes equivalent to determining the similarity of graphs. The measurement of similarity is normally performed by determining the maximum common subgraph of the graphs in question. This paper presents a new algorithm for determining the maximum common subgraph of a pair of graphs which offers better performance than existing algorithms.

A novel scalable parallel algorithm for finding optimal paths over heterogeneous terrain
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The area of path planning has received a great deal of attention recently. Algorithms are required that can deliver optimal paths for robots to take over homogeneous or non-homogeneous terrain. Optimal paths may be those that involve the shortest distance travelled, the least number of turns or the least number of ascents and descents. The often highly complex nature of terrains and the necessity for realtime solutions have lead to a requirement for the development of parallel algorithms. Such problems have been notoriously difficult to parallelise efficiently; indeed it has been said that an efficiency of 25-60% should be considered a success. In this paper we present a parallel algorithm for finding optimal paths over non-homogeneous terrain that demonstrates superlinear speed-up.

IPMatrix: an effective visualization framework for cyber threat monitoring
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
An effective Internet cyber threat monitoring system detects cyber threats using network sensors deployed at particular points on the Internet, statistically analyses the time of attack, source of attack, and type of attack, and then visualizes the result of this analysis. Existing systems, however, simply visualize country-by-country statistics of attacks or hourly changes of attacks. Using these systems, it is difficult to understand the source of attack, the diffusion of the attack, or the relation between the target and the source of the attack. This paper described a method for visualizing cyber threats by using 2-dimensional matrix representation of IP addresses. The advantages of this method are that: (I) the logical distance of IP addresses is represented intuitively, (2) Internet address space is visualized economically, (3) macroscopic information (site level) and microscopic information (local level) are visualized simultaneously. By using this visualization framework, propagation of the Welchia worm and the Sasser.D worm are visualized.

Visualizing a temporal consistency checker
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2005
The notion of time plays a vital and ubiquitous role of a common universal reference. In knowledge-based systems, temporal information is usually represented in terms of a collection of statements, together with the corresponding temporal reference. This paper introduces a visualized consistency checker for temporal reference. It allows expression of both absolute and relative temporal knowledge, and provides visual representation of temporal references in terms of directed and partially weighted graphs. Based on the temporal reference of a given scenario, the visualized checker can deliver a verdict to the user as to whether the scenario is temporally consistent or not, and provide the corresponding analysis/diagnosis.

This paper presents a visualization tool, VisHD, that can visualize the spatial distribution of vector points in high dimensional feature space. It is important to handle high dimensional information in many areas of computer science. VisHD provides several methods for dimension reduction in order to map the data from high dimensional space to low dimensional one. Next, this system builds intuitive visualization for observing the characteristics of the data set, whether these data are pre-defined labels or not. In addition, some useful functions have been implemented to facilitate the information visualization. This paper, finally, gives some experiments and discussions for showing the abilities of VisHD for visualizing high-dimensional data.

Visualisation and analysis of network motifs
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Many of the complex networks that occur both in nature and in technology are built up from frequently recurring patterns of basic structural elements. These structural patterns known as motifs play a significant role in the function of the network. Visualisation is a useful tool for understanding the structure in a network. The quality of a visualisation can be significantly improved if it effectively displays these motifs. In this paper we present visualisations designed to highlight motifs detected through analysis. We argue that these visualisations designed to show functionally important subgraphs give a greater insight into the function of the network.

Interactive refinement of multi-scale network clusterings
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Insight of multiscale networks could be accessed through the visualization of automatic multiscale clusterings. But results of these methods do not necessarily fulfill user expectations since they don't provide error prone clusterings. In this article we propose a way to refine interactively these results by the use of multiscale grouping and ungrouping interactions. This approach revealed to give very good results on common networks, especially on small world networks. Moreover, the linear algorithm makes that the method remains interactive on huge graphs with thousand of nodes.

Framework for spatial visual design of abstract information

2005
Spatially-organized information can be accessed and operated on rapidly and effortlessly, especially when a spatial arrangement reveals the conceptual organization of information. Therefore, spatial perception plays an important role for cognitive processing when interacting with abstract information. The process of spatial information visualization is shaped by various factors including interactive, perceptual, navigational as well as organizational and metaphorical aspects and as such requires an interdisciplinary approach. Consequently, bringing the knowledge from different disciplines requires the development of a framework which can host and classify the interdisciplinary features important in designing effective spatial visualizations. In this paper we present a framework which manifests a holistic approach in designing spatial visualization of abstract information.

2005
When creating a visualization for communication, the inclusion of aesthetically appealing elements can greatly increase a design's appeal, intuitiveness and memorability. Used without care, this "sizzle" can reduce the effectiveness of the visualization by obscuring the intended message. Maintaining a focus on key design principles and an understanding of the target audience can result in an effective visualization for communication. This paper describes these principles and shows their use in creating effective designs.

Polyscopy is offered as a new paradigm in the design for the Web.

We show how certain tools and techniques from polyscopy may be applied to devise a methodology for designing for the Web. Our approach allows us to highlight a central role of visual information (creation and presentation of high-level information) and to specify and discuss visual information design criteria.

Building and supporting shared understanding in collaborative problem-solving

Over the last decade the level of interest in the field of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) has grown enormously to support various collaborative activities. Basically they all support argumentation in one or the other way. While many environments do support the process of bringing people into collaboration, the participants often fail to understand each others' activities, knowledge, beliefs or communicating contextual information. We propose an interface for the interactive construction of a Bayesian belief network for not only inferencing in uncertainty, but also for enhancing the deliberation of argumentation, and visualizing the insights of collaborative discourse to build and support shared understanding.

Automatic landmark identification in large virtual environment: a spatial data mining approach
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Navigation is playing an increasingly important role in virtual environments (VE). Today virtual worlds are very large and present challenging navigation tasks. Usually a VE contains few visual details and hence few landmarks to support navigation. In this paper, we propose a technique to automatic identify landmarks in large virtual environment using spatial data mining techniques. Identified landmarks are used to enrich landmark knowledge which is essential for navigation in VE. Initially three datasets with different number of objects have been generated based on a realistic distribution of buildings on one of newest and well designed Egyptian cities. A new model for extracting landmarks in VE was developed based on the models used in real environment. The proposed technique was applied on the generated cities and successfully identified the landmarks.

3D visualisation of spatial information and environmental process model outputs for collaborative data exploration
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Increased access to consolidated digital spatial data via spatial data infrastructures (SDI) is advancing the potential for spatial analysis applications such as environmental process modelling. While a number of expert visualisation packages exist for environmental models, there is a lack of widely available interactive visualisation tools. To provide for greater community engagement, virtual environments that are online, collaborative and can run on low-cost PCs are required. This paper discusses the development of a tool which aims to provide both expert and non-experts with access to environmental process model outputs. Conversion from standard format GIS data, into a game engine has been achieved. A methodology for mapping the effects from environmental model outputs into the virtual environment has also been shaped. Development of a 3D object library, for vegetation and other matter, implementation of the tool on a network and specification of criteria for display and communication options in a multi-skilled environment are the current focus. Envisaged system use scenarios have been devised in collaboration with national and state agencies, who are the clients for this research.

This paper presents results from an empirical research study designed to investigate the affect of data format on user exploration patterns of spatial data visualized through GIS tables and maps. An experiment was designed in which geographic data were organized into point, line, and area tables and maps. These data were explored through a customized GIS interface and user exploration patterns were recorded. The results provide support for the application of the dominant framework theories (that explain mental map formation from direct exposure to a real-world geographic environment) to learning spatial data visualized in GIS.

The popularity of 3D graphics has grown exponentially in the latest years, which has lead to an increase in the range of applications where this kind of representations are used. The monitoring of industrial processes is an area where this type of simulation is rarely used, being much more common to show the information in traditional 2D interfaces. An application for data visualization in maritime container terminals is introduced here. We have developed a modular system adaptable to any stacked objects problem. This paper describes the architecture of our system, its features, and the graphics techniques applied to achieve a high frame rate and keep it independent of the data size.

The effect that touching a projection augmented model has on object-presence
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
A projection augmented model (PA model) is a type of projection based haptic augmented reality display. It consists of a real physical model, onto which a computer image is projected to create a realistic looking object. Users can physically touch the surface of a PA model with their bare hands, which has clear experiential value for the types of applications for which they are being developed. However, the majority of PA models are front-projected and do not provide haptic feedback for material properties (e.g. temperature and physical texture), which suggests a user's sense of object-presence will be reduced when this type of PA model is touched. (object-presence measures the subjective feeling that the object the PA model represents exists in a person's environment, as opposed to a white physical model and a projected computer image.) Alternatively, if people consider PA models to be essentially computer generated objects (i. e. it is the projected image that gives the 'dummy' physical model meaning), then the act of being able to touch computer generated information may increase object-presence. The empirical investigation reported in this paper found that object-presence was lower when this type of PA model was touched. The implications these results have for both PA models and other types of displays, are discussed.

Visual exploration of the spatial distribution of temporal behaviors
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The paper elaborates on the previous research on the analysis of temporal and spatio-temporal data done in statistical graphics and geo-visualization. We focus on the exploration of spatially distributed time-series data, i.e. values of numeric attributes referring to different moments in time and locations in space. After considering appropriate interactive visualization techniques, we propose several methods of exploration based on user-controlled data transformation and aggregation, easy-to-understand calculations, and dynamic linking of data displays. The proposed methods are potentially scalable, i.e. they can be applied to large data sets without overcrowding the displays and loosing interactivity.

Software support for annotation of visualized data using hand-drawn marks
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Modern tools for visualization of information can be very helpful for data analysis and discovery of patterns in data. The paper describes a framework for documenting of findings using freehand drawings on top of the displays representing data. These drawings or marks become a basis for the annotations of the analyzed information. The marks are used to designate patterns in data and to refer to data elements with interesting characteristics. A model of data visualization is described that allows encoding of marks in terms of the presented information. This brings independence of marks from the specifics of visualizing methods - the marks are adapted according to changes of the way the data is presented. Such representation of marks also gives the possibility for the system to provide the user with information and statistics about the data referred by marks and to initiate visualizations showing the referred data in other perspectives.

Interactive visualization of high dimensional marketing data in the financial industry
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
We describe the visualization of high dimensional marketing data for a financial asset management company. The data typically consists of 30 to a 100 variables of 25000 to half a million clients. We use the visualization of the correlation matrix as a variable selection tool which makes it easier to find patterns in the data. The user can then select data ranges of the selected variables and start a cluster analysis using 5 variables. The clustered data are then visualized as a set of spheres. In an additional visualization we first sort data values of a client variable and then visualize the sorted cubic data in a cube using volume rendering and isosurfaces. The interactive correlation visualization allows marketing researchers to quickly explore all kinds of combinations of variables, which enables them to find valuable client behavior patterns much faster. The cluster visualization allowed researchers to identify detailed groups of customer with similar behavior. Additionally, the visualization of the sorted cubic data gives in dept information of one variable over the total sample of customers. With these visualizations, a better understanding is given on customer behavior.

Improved visual clustering of large multi-dimensional data sets
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Lowering computational cost of data analysis and visualization techniques is an essential step towards including the user in the visualization. In this paper we present an improved algorithm for visual clustering of large multi-dimensional data sets. The original algorithm is an approach that deals efficiently with multi-dimensionality using various projections of the data in order to perform multi-space clustering, pruning outliers through direct user interaction. The algorithm presented here, named HC-Enhanced (for human-computer enhanced), adds a scalability level to the approach without reducing clustering quality. Additionally, an algorithm to improve clusters is added to the approach. A number of test cases is presented with good results.

Improving 2D scatterplots effectiveness through sampling, displacement, and user perception

In this paper we present a novel, hybrid, and automatic strategy whose goal is to reduce the 2D scatter plot cluttering. The presented technique relies on a combination of nonuniform sampling and pixel displacement and it is driven by perceptual results coming from a suitable user study. The same results are used to define precise quality metrics that allow for validating our approach.

Connectivity compression for three-dimensional planar triangle meshes
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
We describe a new algorithm for coding the connectivity information of three-dimensional planar triangle meshes. Vertices of a mesh are placed on a two-dimensional grid. The connectivity pattern of the grid is implicit and hence the only information that needs to be encoded is the diagonal links. We present experimental results that show that the new method has a low connectivity cost of 2.1 bits per vertex on average.

PolyMeCo - a polygonal mesh comparison tool
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Polygonal meshes are used in many areas to model different objects and structures. Depending on their applications, they sometimes have to be processed to, for instance, reduce their complexity (simplification). This mesh processing introduces error, whose evaluation is important when choosing the kind of processing that is to be done for a particular application. Although some mesh comparison tools are described in the literature, little attention has been given to the way results are presented. A tool is presented which enhances the way users perform mesh analysis and comparison, by providing an environment where several visualization options are available and can be used in a coordinated way.

Hierarchical indexing for 3D head model retrieval based on kernel PCA
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
In this paper, a novel 3D head model retrieval framework is proposed. First, kernel PCA is adopted both to reduce the data dimension and to extract features for model characterization. Second, based on the derived features, a hierarchical indexing structure for 3D model database is constructed using the hierarchical self organizing map (HSOM). Third, an efficient search approach is presented based on the established indexing structure that requires only feature matching between the query model and a small number of SOM nodes. The main advantages of our approach include high retrieval precision due to the discrimination capacity of kernel PCA, and low computation cost due to the hierarchical indexing structure and data dimension reduction. In addition, the topology-preserving property of HSOM also facilitates the exploration of the model database with the possibility of further knowledge discovery.

Heterogeneous objects modelling and rendering using implicit complexes
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This paper describes a technology for modelling and rendering heterogeneous objects containing entities of various dimensionalities within a cellular-functional framework based on the implicit complex notion. Implicit complexes make it possible to combine a cellular representation and a constructive function representation. We describe a formal framework for such a hybrid representation and propose a general structure for implicit complexes. Then, we consider how an implicit complex can be described geometrically and topologically along with its associated attributes. Rendering algorithms for implicit complexes using ray-tracing are also discussed. Finally, we present a case study illustrating the proposed methods and algorithms.

Quadric modeling in a Grassmann-Cayley algebra setting
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
We expose a few geometric techniques for determining intersections between lines and conic curves in a plane, and between planes and quadric surfaces in 3D projective space. We hope these techniques to be useful as elements for handling conies and quadrics in a Grassmann-Cayley algebra framework. In order to comply with this objective, we mostly derive our algorithms from ruler-only constructions, which possess an immediate translation in Grassmann-Cayley' s formalism. At the basis of these constructions we use reference points which determine the conic or quadric. Besides intersections, we also address the determination of poles and polars, and we mention a possible application to the parameterization of portions of quadrics.

The effect of data-relatedness in interactive glyphs
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Interactive visualization of multidimensional data is an important activity in many information acquisition tasks. We introduce a new interaction method for glyphs, an adoption of the 'small multiples' presentation method. It has been used extensively in printed graphics and also in scientific visualization, but its applications in information visualization have been few. We propose a method for interacting with small multiple displays that allows rapid and easy experimentation with glyph property assignments. In addition, we present findings on the relation between the glyphs and the data. The results of our experiment with 18 subjects support the idea that a data-related glyph is more favored by the users and about 13% more accurate than an unrelated glyph in information acquisition tasks. Additionally, the proposed visualization technique may prove to be efficient enough for non-experts to explore multi-dimensional data sets.

Visualizing query occurrence in search result lists
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The result lists of popular Web search engines represent retrieved documents with only a title, a brief textual summary and a URL. We present a novel approach that incorporates visualization into the conventional search result interface. For each resulting document, occurrences of the entire query are concisely depicted in the form of a small, document-shaped icon. An 18-participant user study was carried out to compare our design with the traditional search result list in terms of accuracy and task performance. Though statistically significant differences in performance were not observed, the participants' subjective ratings and opinions of the visualization's utility were positive. Despite the fact that the visualization introduces a new and somewhat complicated variable to consider when evaluating search result lists, the participants' performance did not fall below their performance level with the traditional interface. Our findings indicate the need to study such interfaces in a longitudinal setting.

Visual exploration of time-varying matrices
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
In this paper, we present several extensions of our previous work on combining the multidimensional scaling technique and the reorderable matrix method to visualize time-varying matrices: (a) the Sammon mapping is employed as another dimension reduction technique that in contrast to multidimensional scaling pays more attention to small distances; (b) a novel method for the interactive colored visualization of covariances/correlations is presented; (c) the K-means clustering algorithm is used and its results are directly visualized in the mentioned dimension reduction plots; (d) a novel view, namely the visualization of the timely evolution of the cluster membership, is proposed. The latter is based on calculating accumulated adjacency matrix that gathers the information regarding membership of objects in clusters for each point of time. The color visualization of this matrix allows the investigation of changes in cluster memberships and possible outliers, i.e. objects that change clusters frequently. Results are presented by visualizing sensitivity matrices generated during the simulation of metabolic network models.

Faster is better: optimal speed of animated visualizations for decision makers
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Controlling dynamic processes is a task that is increasingly important in many areas. A possible visualization technique for time-dependent events is animation. However, there are to our knowledge no data available on how different animation speeds affect the performance of human decision makers when trying to discover complex patterns in animations. An experiment was therefore deigned using a cue probability learning paradigm. The results indicate that speed is indeed affecting performance, at least in the more challenging condition we used. Some implications of these results are discussed.

Enhanced SIC (synergistic image creator) for artistic use
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
We are studying non-photo realistic rendering (NPR) with the goal of developing an image expression tool to create artworks by the NPR technique. The purpose of most NPR researches is to simulate typical painting styles, so they focus on techniques to create brushstrokes. These superficially modified images cannot deviate far from the source photo. If a rendered image is seen from a distance, it is difficult to tell the difference from the source photo. This fact makes us realize that other important elements to add artistic expression to the photographs exist. We supposed that the distribution of bright and dark parts over the painting is essential and proposed the effective way to modify that. Our novel technique is based on knowledge about human optical illusions and basic visual design rules. We integrate this technique into our NPR system, which was used to make the artworks selected by SIGGRAPH 2002 2D art gallery. Furthermore, we present new features that allow artist to select appropriate area for extreme expressions, to create many types of brushstrokes, and to choose more than two types of brushstrokes for a single artwork.

Seeing eye-to-eye: supportive transdisciplinary environments for interactive art
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This paper presents findings from a study of the social and technical roles of programmers in art-technology collaborations. Combined with a review of the supportive and obstructive roles of technology with respect to helping artists to learn programming, we show that programmers can play several roles in such collaborations, both supportive of and obstructive to the requirements of artists, beyond merely 'doing the programming'. Of central importance is the process of 'attuning' between the actors and artefacts involved. All this is used to suggest some high-level ways in which visualisation technology can be employed to aid both the programming process (for artist and technologist) and the art-technology collaboration process.

The naturalness of reproduced high dynamic range images
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The problem of visualizing high dynamic range images on the devices with restricted dynamic range has recently gained a lot of interest in the computer graphics community. Various so-called tone mapping operators have been proposed to face this issue. The field of tone mapping assumes thorough knowledge of both the objective and subjective attributes of an image. However, there no published analysis of such attributes exists so far. In this paper, we present an overview of image attributes which are used extensively in different tone mapping methods. Furthermore, we propose a scheme of relationships between these attributes, leading to the definition of an overall quality measure which we call naturalness. We present results of the subjective psychophysical testing that we have performed to prove the proposed relationship scheme. Our effort sets the stage for well-founded quality comparisons between tone mapping operators. By providing good definitions of the different attributes, comparisons, be they user-driven or fully automatic, are made possible at all.

Painting the digital river
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This paper recounts the rationale and process of writing a book on digital painting, the coming together of computer graphics and contemporary art. As both a digital and a 'physical' painter, I felt there were fascinating possibilities the practitioner comes across, but these implications were being overlooked. There is a view that 'new media' will simply replace 'traditional media', like painting. I intended to show that a painter can 'go digital' and yet remain quite obviously a painter. There had to be a balance between the detailed discussion of computer graphics and the detail of painting: the techniques, the histories, the continuing debates, in a way that would bring it alive to a wider readership. The title, 'Painting the Digital River', is a metaphor for what divides the territory, for the co-existence of change and continuity, and for the journey of discovery.

Capturing team dynamics through temporal social surfaces
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
This paper introduces temporal social surfaces. Temporal social surfaces show the dynamic evolution of social relationships in groups. Changes in measures of social network analysis such as betweenness centrality are plotted as a curve for each actor. The curves for all actors are combined in a single picture. Smoothing the resulting surface leads to a single-picture overview of social dynamics of a group. Temporal social surfaces are computed using two variants of a "sliding time window" algorithm with TeCFlow (temporal communication flow visualizer). TeCFlow is a system for creating movies of temporal information such as e-mail archives, Web logs, and Web search results. TeCFlow takes as input time series of records, and generates an interactive movie of the changes in the resulting directed graph.

Understanding the evolution of NSAID: a knowledge domain visualization approach to evidence-based medicine
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
Finding the most rigorous, updated, and well received clinical evidence is a crucial and challenging task in the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM). In this article, we describe a knowledge domain visualization-based quantitative approach that is designed to support the task of searching for high-quality clinical evidence in the medical literature. We illustrate the use of this new approach with the knowledge domain of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A sample of the literature is visualized in a base map depicting structural and temporal properties of emerging themes and references made by such themes over time. In addition, the visualization highlights the rigorousness of a published clinical trial in terms of the type of study design retrieved dynamically from PubMed. The contribution of this approach is that it offers users an integrated search environment so that the rigorousness, recentness, and consensus of clinical evidence can be assessed with the support of visual exploration facilities.

The application of adaptive beam tracing and managed DirectX for the visualisation and auralisation of virtual environments
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The paper outlines the generation of virtual environments using the author's own adaptive beam tracing algorithm for the prediction of room acoustics. Details of this novel algorithm were first published in the Journal of Acoustics Society of America in 1999. Essentially the algorithm simulates the propagation of sound within an environment using reflected beams whose shape is governed by the shape of reflecting surfaces. Hence the adaptive beam tracing avoids spurious and missing reflections or large computation times associated with other methods whilst providing the prediction of both specular and diffuse sound propagation. The current implementation uses the new managed DirectX API for simulating visually and aurally virtual environments and explores possibility of real time acoustic rendering using predicted acoustics in conjunction with the 3D rendering classes offered by managed DirectX.

There is increasing interest in the use of multimedia and Web based materials for teaching and learning; areas of particular significance for the use of enhanced learning materials are those that may be inaccessible to certain student populations. Environments such as building sites present unique safety and access difficulties for visits and are particularly suitable for virtual exploration using interactive software. In this paper, we present a tool that provides multiple cross linked digital media of a construction site, address some of the issues in the choice of delivery format and present an initial assessment of the efficacy of the software for teaching and learning.

Loop snakes: the generalized model
Ninth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2005
The topologically adaptable snake model, or simply T-snakes, is a useful tool for automatically identifying multiple segments in an image. According to A. Oliveira et al. (2004), a novel approach for controlling the topology of a T-snake was introduced. That approach focuses on the loops formed by the projected curve which is obtained at every stage of the snake evolution. The idea is to make that curve the image of a piecewise linear mapping of an adequate class. Then, with the help of an additional structure, the loop-tree, it is possible to decide in 0(1) time whether the region delimited by each loop has already been explored by the snake. In the original proposal of the loop snakes model, the snake evolution is limited to contraction and there is only one T-snake that contracts and splits during evolution. In this paper we generalize the original model by allowing the contraction as well as the expansion of several T-snakes.

2005
Research in the area of spatial visualization enjoys a long tradition in the discipline of cognitive psychology. However, the computer graphics profession, particularly the educational component, takes into account a person's spatial abilities as a means for designing effective instructional experiences and assessments. It builds on a learner's visual or haptic abilities. This paper outlines a brief history of visualization assessments instruments and strategies and their use within computer graphics-related learning environments. The use of virtual reality technologies to enable the learning process is discussed, as well as an introduction to visual science as a discipline.

Visual Analytics is the science of analytical reasoning supported by interactive visual interfaces. People use visual analytics tools and techniques to synthesize information; derive insight from massive, dynamic, and often conflicting data; detect the expected and discover the unexpected; provide timely, defensible, and understandable assessments; and communicate assessments effectively for action. The issues stimulating this body of research provide a grand challenge in science: turning information overload into the opportunity of the decade. Visual analytics requires interdisciplinary science beyond traditional scientific and information visualization to include statistics, data mining, knowledge and discovery technologies, cognitive science and humancomputer interaction, production and presentation, and more. An important research agenda "Illuminating the Path" provides recommendations for the next generation suite of visual analytics technologies and is available at http://nvac.pnl.gov/agenda.stm .

Challenges in Visual Data Analysis
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
In today's applications data is produced at unprecedented rates. While the capacity to collect and store new data grows rapidly, the ability to analyze these data volumes increases at much lower pace. This gap leads to new challenges in the analysis process, since analysts, decision makers, engineers, or emergency response teams depend on information "concealed" in the data. The emerging field of visual analytics focuses on handling massive, heterogenous, and dynamic volumes of information through integration of human judgement by means of visual representations and interaction techniques in the analysis process. Furthermore, it is the combination of related research areas including visualization, data mining, and statistics that turns visual analytics into a promising field of research. This paper aims at providing an overview of visual analytics, its scope and concepts, and details the most important technical research challenges in the field

Fisheye Tree Views and Lenses for Graph Visualization
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
We present interactive visual aids to support the exploration and navigation of graph layouts. They include fisheye tree views and composite lenses. These views provide, in an integrated manner, overview+detail and focus+context. Fisheye tree views are novel applications of the well known fisheye distortion technique. They facilitate the exploration of the hierarchy trees associated with clustered graphs. Composite lenses are the result of the integration of several lens techniques. They facilitate the display of local graph information that may be otherwise difficult to grasp in large and dense graph layouts

The voluminous nature of social scientific, spatial-temporal statistical databases calls for high interactive performance and creative integrated information and geo-visualization tools. A solution to this challenge can be found in the emerging visual analytics (VA), a science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces and innovative visualization and is now actively pursued by research groups worldwide. In this paper, we present a tool called "GeoAnalytics\

Scalable Pixel-based Visual Interfaces: Challenges and Solutions
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
The information revolution is creating and publishing vast data sets, such as records of business transactions, environmental statistics and census demographics. In many application domains, this data is collected and indexed by geo-spatial location. The discovery of interesting patterns in such databases through visual analytics is a key to turn this data into valuable information. Challenges arise because newly available geo-spatial data sets often have millions of records, or even far more, they are from multiple and heterogeneous data sources, and the output devices have significantly changed, e.g. high-resolution pixilated displays are increasingly available in both wall-sized and desktop units. New techniques are needed to cope with this scale. In this paper, we focus on ways to increase the scalability of pixel-based visual interfaces by adding task on hands scenarios that tightly integrate the data analyst into the exploration of geo-spatial data sets

WorldMirror and WorldBottle: Components for Interaction between Multiple Spaces in a 3D Virtual Environment
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper proposes a new concept and mechanism for the user and content interaction between multiple spaces in a 3D virtual environment. We introduce two types of visual components; aflat, window-like WorldMirror, and a volumetric WorldBottle. These components embed other spaces inside and render them on their surface, so that users can look into the contents of other spaces from their current working one and choose to enter. They also allow content manipulation in embedded spaces from the current space. Users can move an object from an embedded space to the current working space, or drop an object from the current space into an embedded space. In contrast to conventional approaches, the proposed mechanism enables us not only to define a spatial connection between different spaces, but also to define a functional linkage among components in different spaces

A Context-Based Adaptive Visualization Environment
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Digital libraries and historical archives are increasingly employing visualization systems to facilitate the information retrieval and knowledge extraction tasks of their users. Typically, each organization employs a single visualization system, which may not suit best the needs of certain user groups, specific tasks, or properties of document collections to be visualized. In this paper, we present a context-based adaptive visualization environment, which embeds a set of visualization methods into a visualization library, from which the most appropriate one is selected for presenting information to the user. Methods are selected by examining parameters related to the user profile, system configuration and the set of data to be visualized, and employing a set of rules to assess the suitability of each method. The presented environment additionally monitors user behavior and preferences to adapt the visualization method selection criteria

Using the Amazon Metric to Construct an Image Database based on what people do, not what they say.
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Current image database metadata schemas require users to adopt a specific text-based vocabulary. Text-based metadata is good for searching but not for browsing. Existing image-based search facilities, on the other hand, are highly specialised and so suffer similar problems. Wexelblat's semantic dimensional spatial visualisation schemas go some way towards addressing this problem by making both searching and browsing more accessible to the user in a single interface. But the question of how and what initial metadata to enter a database remains. Different people see different things in an image and will organise a collection in equally diverse ways. However, we can find some similarity across groups of users regardless of their reasoning. For example, a search on Amazon.com returns other products also, based on an averaging of how users navigate the database. In this paper, we report on applying this concept to a set of images for which we have visualised them using traditional methods and the Amazon.com method. We report on the findings of this comparative investigation in a case study setting involving a group of randomly selected participants. We conclude with the recommendation that in combination, the traditional and averaging methods would provide an enhancement to current database visualisation, searching, and browsing facilities

Colour Spectrum's of Opinion: An Information Visualisation Interface for Representing Degrees of Emotion in Real Time
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
In this paper we present an information visualisation interface that enables a user to input a real-time continuous flow of their predominant emotion incorporating degrees of uncertainty relative to other choices. The novel equilateral triangle-based interface allows users to express opinions on temporal media presentations such as television advertisements, video and musical compositions. The continuous flow of information generated by the interface is mapped into a colour spectrum which reveals a user's developing opinion of the presentation. Such a colour spectrum not only provides a visual snapshot to enhance statistical interpretations of user input but also provides valuable insight into when, how and with what degree of certainty opinions were developed and changed over time. The real-time emotional spectrum tool (REST) is being developed to answer a need in the commercial research market. It is intended for use in gathering opinions from online audiences

Visualization of Lattice-Based Protein Folding Simulations
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Analysis of the spatial structure of proteins including folding processes is a challenge for modern bioinformatics. Due to limited experimental access to folding processes, computer simulations are a standard approach. Since realistic continuous (all-atom) simulations are far too expensive, lattice based protein folding simulations are a common coarse-graining. In this paper, we present a visualization tool for lattice based protein folding simulations. The system is based on Shneiderman's mantra "Overview first, zoom and filter, details on demand" and uses a collection of information visualization techniques including multiple views, focus+context and table lenses which have been tailored towards our data. We demonstrate the potential of information visualization techniques for providing insight into such simulations

Interactive, Task-Oriented Visualizations to Explore Decay Chain Calculation
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Most applications in physical calculations provide powerful multivariate outputs but use rather simple visual representations (diagrams) without the possibilities to explore the resulting data sets. Interdependences in the data are overlooked or stay unseen and the analysis is very time-consuming, because of the difficulty and complexity for users to grasp the results. In this paper, we present a tool which combines a visual structure recognised by the physical community with interactive information visualization techniques to support the analysis of decay chain calculations. In a case study we showed that our tool helped experts in the field to analyse radioactive decay chains where the representation of results is more concise and conclusions are easier drawn

Topic Tracer: a Visualization Tool for Quick Reference of Stories Embedded in Document Set
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper proposes a visualization tool, called Topic Tracer, to show topic transitions of not only a story existing in a document but also stories traversing over several documents. To visualize topic transition, first we have developed an analytical method to divide a document into parts. Then, we introduce a Word Colony to show topic terms in a whole or a part of document. It is a directed graph which shows the dependency relationships among terms occurrences in the target document. The Word Colony helps users to grasp the overview of a document. The concatenation of Word Colony gives plots of an existing story or crossing stories over several documents. This paper explains the concept and implementation of Topic Tracer using the minutes of the CUBE-SAT project, "Student-built Educational Pico-Satellite Design\

From Visualization to Manipulation of RNA Secondary and Tertiary Structures
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2006
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is an important molecule which performs a wide range of functions in biological systems. We present a method for visualizing, exploring and editing RNA molecules. The method relies on the visualization of the 3D tertiary structure of RNA as well as on the automatic extraction and visualization of the 2D secondary structure. The 2D representation is used to navigate in the tertiary structure. The method has been implemented in a multi-surface interactive system, NAVRNA, that allows collaborative analysis of RNA

Collecting and Harnessing Rich Session Histories
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2006
To be most useful, evaluation requires detailed observation and effective analysis of a full spectrum of system use. We have developed an approach and architecture for in-depth data collection and analysis of all use of a visualization system. User interface components in a large visualization and analysis platform automatically record user actions, and can restore previous system states on demand. Audio and text annotations are collected and indexed to states, allowing users to find a comment and restore the system state in which they made it; then explore actions before and after. History is visible as data; so a variety of visual displays and analysis techniques may be used to develop insights about the user's experience. States of any part of the interface may be analyzed separately. Actions are categorized in a taxonomy as the user interface is built, allowing comparison of similar patterns in all tools. History data can co-exist with other data during data exploration, supporting further individual or group data exploration

Email is an important form of asynchronous communication. Visualizing analyses of email communication patterns during a collaborative activity help us better understand the nature of collaboration, and identify the key players. By analysing the contents of email communication and adding reflective comments on its perceived importance from the participants of a collaboration new information can be gleaned not immediately obvious in its original flat form. This paper outlines a proof-of-concept prototype collaborative email visualisation schema. Data from a collaboration case study is analysed and subsequently employed to construct a display of the relative impact of both key players and the types of email used

A number of research teams are working to organize personalized access to the modern repositories of educational resources. The goal of personalized access is to help students locate resources that match their individual goals, interests, and current knowledge. The project presented in this paper is focused on the least explored way of personalized access - adaptive visualization. Here, we present the NavEx ADVISE visualization system, which provides personalized access to a repository of educational examples. The system combines spatial, similarity-based visualization with adaptive annotations of resources. The spatial layout and the adaptive annotations are generated using a knowledge-based indexing of examples with domain concepts

Towards Ubiquitous Brushing for Information Visualization
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Brushing is a collection of techniques to dynamically query and directly select elements on the visual display. Such interaction allows the user to explore the visualization, to interactively select a subset of points and see how these changes are updated in other related views. Traditionally, the artefacts that are 'brushed' are the plotted elements in the visualization (e.g. the points on a scatter-plot, or the bars of a bar chart). In this paper, we discuss the concept of ubiquitous brushing (UB), which brings together various different types of selection (whether in data space, screen space or views). Not only can users brush over elements in the display but also they can brush over various meta-information such as menus, legends or axis to affect the highlighted elements. The paper discusses the basic idea and demonstrates how subsequent UB operations can be compound together to provide useful dynamic filter operations

The Visual Exploration ofWeb Search Results Using HotMap
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
While the information retrieval techniques used by Web search engines have improved substantially over the years, the search results have continued to be represented in a simple list-based format. Although this list-based representation makes it easy to evaluate a single document, it does not support the users in the broader tasks of manipulating the search results, comparing documents, or finding a set of relevant documents. HotMap provides a compact visual representation of Web search results at two levels of detail, and supports the interactive exploration of Web search results. User studies have shown that HotMap can result in fewer low-relevance documents being considered, and generates a higher level of confidence, ease of use, and satisfaction than a Google-like interface

Visualizing Graphs - A Generalized View
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
The visualization of graphs has proven to be very useful for exploring structures in different application domains. However, in certain fields of computer science, graph visualization is understood and focused quite differently. While "graph drawing" focuses on optimized layouts for node-link-representations of networks, "information visualization" prefers to work on hierarchies focusing on very large structures, different views and interactivity. This paper gives a systematic view of the problem of graph visualization by combining both approaches. We introduce a general view of different visualization methods as well as describe occurring problems and discuss basic constraints. These are used to propose a visualization framework for graphs, whose development motivated this paper

Synchronization Strategies for Spatial Information Organization
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Spatial organisation of information objects on a two or three dimensional plane or space has the advantage of revealing the connections between objects easily by spatial proximity. A user may easily understand, remember and, given an adequate user interface, change the positions and the visual relationships between information objects. If a group of users has access to the same information plane or space the problem arises that conflicts may occur regarding the positioning, the creation and deletion of objects. In this article, we present solution strategies for conflicts concerning collaborative spatial information organization. We present interaction-based and automatic conflict-dissolving procedures in order to realize a version control system for efficient collaborative spatial information organization

Merging Knowledge from Different Disciplines in Search of Potential Design Axioms
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper presents the idea of merging different schools of thinking which have been separated for centuries. Design as a process of creating artifacts and systems varies substantially among individual disciplines. There exists no universally valid and concise definition of the concept design. We first describe different understandings and uses of design with a focus on architecture, engineering, management, and nature. We then show that there is a profound need for merging these different schools of thinking and forming the discipline of design science. The term 'design science' got its first recognition in the 1960s but without attaining a remarkable impact on affected disciplines. Progress in design research and multidisciplinary work arose in the last decades. Research in knowledge transfer and knowledge visualization supports the design science's ability to bridge the remaining gap between disciplines

Is it Now Time to Establish Visualization Science as a Scientific Discipline?
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
It is now time to establish visualization science as a scientific discipline. The proposed deadline to achieve this is 2010. Today, research areas in visualization are isolated. What is missing is the big picture and mutual agendas. To establish visualization science as a discipline, researchers need to agree on the origins and areas of visualization research; then on the long-term (e.g., 2020) research goals. The benefit of an established discipline is more impact, both in teaching (curricula) and research (e.g., framework programmes of the European Union). This article aims to start the discussion on a synthesis through extended definitions and a big picture. It provides an example for a sharp and extended definition of a field that today is vaguely defined: information architecture. Finally, it proposes a draft of the big picture of the fields, the visualization science fingerprint, thus a step towards an established visualization science

An encyclopedia provides a written compendium of knowledge consisting of articles concisely and exhaustively covering topics of interest. Most general encyclopedias are structured in an alphabetical manner and favor keyword queries and link-based navigation as the primary form of access.

Combining query and visual search for knowledge mapping
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Searching through information can be done in two ways: by querying and browsing. In the literature these approaches are treated separately. However every search usually consists of a combination of browsing and querying. Therefore this paper is about combining querying and browsing in one search interface. Our hypothesis is that both strategies can be combined and users will be better supported in their search for information. A model is presented how to combine these approaches and this model is evaluated by applying it in the knowledge-mapping domain. We will show that combining both strategies in one model is possible. Based on our evaluation of the application of this model we conclude that the users understand this combination and find it to be helpful. However several technical issues need to be addressed in our future research to confirm the usefulness of this combination

The Walker &#145; s Perspective: strategies for conveying landscape perception using audiovisual media.
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper presents a method and three case studies for the integration of video into the practice of landscape architecture. As a design practice, landscape architecture is heavily dependent on visualisations. Traditionally maps, perspectives and photographic stills were used, but today these techniques are clearly no longer up to the task: they convey little information about the way we perceive landscape. Landscape perception has changed dramatically since the introduction of the moving image and highspeed travel. Contemporary visualisations of landscapes must therefore include these dynamic parameters in order to meet the profession's needs. We propose video as a new tool for visualizing the perception of and communicating about, landscape. In this paper we first introduce an analytical grid for the evaluation of video as a means of visualising landscape perception, from the vantage point of the slowest traveller, the pedestrian. Using three case studies, we then describe how video may be used to understand the specific situation of a walking perceiver. The findings are important both for practitioners and researchers in landscape architecture and for researchers of all disciplines interested in human perception

This tool is capable of grouping (and separating) documents by their contents, revealing to the user relationships amongst them. This paper also presents a novel multi-dimensional projection technique for text that reduces the quadratic time complexity of our previous approach to O(N3/2), keeping the same quality of maps. The technique creates a surface that reveals intrinsic patterns and supports various kinds of exploration of a text collection

Uncovering the Latent Underlying Domains of a Research Field: Knowledge Visualization Revealed
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper illustrates how to clarify a new research topic - knowledge visualization - in terms of analyzing a vast amount of citations related to this field. The study presents a method that may help scholars who are interested in an inter-disciplinary and not-well-understood research area, such as knowledge visualization by revealing for them the underlying disciplines that a particular research is based upon. Key papers relevant to the research in question are also identified that may help researchers gain an overview of the field. The method discussed in this paper is generic in nature and generally applicable to other research topics

Mapping Scientific Disciplines and Author Expertise Based on Personal Bibliography Files
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper presents a novel approach (1) to define, analyze, and map a scientific discipline and (2) to compare and map the expertise of single authors based on personal bibliography files, e.g., bibtex or EndNote files. Section one motivates this research and relates it to existing work. Section two explains the general procedure from data harvesting, parsing, cleaning via the analysis and mapping of the data to the interpretation of results. To illustrate the new approach, we asked major experts on 'network science' to share their bibtex or EndNote files with us. Using this data set we exemplify data harvesting, data cleaning and integration; give simple statistics, analysis and visualization results such as a map of the network science discipline based on co-author networks and a map of the content coverage and overlay of contributing experts. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and opportunities as well as planned future work

Developing User Requirements for Visualizations of Literature Knowledge Domains
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
As researchers we are constantly working with our literature domains. Making sense and familiarizing ourselves with such domains is a cumbersome but necessary task that is part of every researcher's career, especially novices. Literature knowledge domain visualizations exist which assist users in extracting and interpreting interesting patterns. However, these visualizations tend to be developed without reference to the particular needs of researchers or without addressing the specific challenges of the literature knowledge domain. This paper therefore targets the needs of researchers as they work with their literature. We conducted a qualitative study to understand how researchers make sense of their literature domains. Such information assisted us in coming up with a set of design considerations and guidelines which we believe will assist in building visualizations that are useful for the general research population

Visualizing Concept Associations Using Concept Density Maps
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
The concept mapping algorithm proposed in an earlier paper is one of the dimensionality reduction techniques that can be used for knowledge domain visualization. Using this algorithm to visualize large knowledge domains may not always provide a good overview of the domain due to visual cluttering of concepts. In this paper, we propose to apply kernel density estimation to the visualization of concept maps in order to be able to better explore large knowledge domains. Kernel density estimation proves to be useful for the identification of concept clusters at different levels of detail. In addition to the visual exploration of large knowledge domains, we are also able to visually verify the hypothesis that the concept mapping algorithm places related concepts close to each other. The flexibility and effectiveness of our approach is validated by applying the proposed technique to different visualization scenarios for the field of computational intelligence

Research Community Mining with Topic Identification
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Since research trends can change dynamically, researchers have to keep up with these new trends and undertake new research topics. Therefore, research communities for new research domains are important. In this paper, we propose a method to discover research communities. The key features of our method are a network model of papers and a word assignment technique for the communities obtained. We show our system based on the proposed method and discuss our system through case studies and experiments

Visual Mapping of Text Collections through a Fast High Precision Projection Technique
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper introduces least square projection (LSP), a fast technique for projection of multi-dimensional data onto lower dimensions developed and tested successfully in the context of creation of text maps based on their content. Current solutions are either based on computationally expensive dimension reduction with no proper guarantee of the outcome or on faster techniques that need some sort of post-processing for recovering information lost during the process. LSP is based on least square approximation, a technique originally employed for surface modeling and reconstruction. Least square approximations are capable of computing the coordinates of a set of projected points based on a reduced number of control points with defined geometry. We extend the concept for general data sets. In order to perform the projection, a small number of distance calculations is necessary and no repositioning of the final points is required to obtain a satisfactory precision of the final solution. Textual information is a typically difficult data type to handle, due to its intrinsic dimensionality. We employ document corpora as a benchmark to demonstrate the capabilities of the LSP to group and separate documents by their content with high precision

Playing with maps Explore, discover, learn, categorize, model, analyse, explain, present geographic and non-geographic data
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Maps are especially known for their capability to provide insight in geographic patterns and trends. Maps do this well because they only present a selection of the complex reality and visualize it in an abstract way. But today they have many more roles to play. They should also be seen as flexible interface to geospatial data, since they offer interaction with the data behind the visual representation and additionally maps are instruments that encourage exploration. As such they are used to stimulate (visual) thinking about geospatial patterns, relationships, and trends. The context where maps like this operate is the world of geovisualization which can be described as a loosely bounded domain that addresses the visual exploration, analysis, synthesis and presentation of geospatial data by integrating approaches from disciplines including cartography with those from scientific visualization, image analysis, information visualization, exploratory data analysis, visual analytics, and GIScience. Contact with all those disciplines has enriched the world of maps but have also stimulated others to use the map (metaphor) to visualize non-geographic data. The discussion illustrated the new and exiting role maps can play to visualize geographic and non-geographic data in combination with other visual means

Schematic Maps as an Alternative to Point Coverages When Topographic Maps are not Available
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper describes the visualization methods of point related spatial information used in geo-portals for tourism and recreation. We examine the issue of visualization of points of interest when base topographic maps are not available. We compare the schematic map approach to point coverages. In our hypothesis, we suggest that the schematic map approach offers the best alternatives for assisting the tourist in taking decisions during the planning phase of an excursion when detailed topographic map information is not available. We use algebraic operations to evaluate the visualization approaches

Output Media Adapted Cartographic Visualisation
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
In modern cartography of the late twentieth century, the Internet offers an ideal platform for the communication via maps. The map graphics pose as an essential part of the graphical user interface in atlas information systems (AIS) that enables the user to investigate the underlying data. Existing AIS largely deal with functionalities, but often do not concentrate on visualisation aspects. The solutions vary from simple line graphics with hardly any cartographic characteristics to systems that are based on scanned maps, ignoring the technical restrictions of the screen as an output medium. So the authors are searching for high-class AIS which should rely on cartographically improved map graphics suitable for both, screen visualisation and high-quality printing. Using legible map graphics which are adapted to the technical requirements of the output medium is one of the main criteria for user acceptance. Concerning the definition of characteristic sheets for printed maps, much experience has been gained within the last few decades. The situation is not the same for screen visualisation. Due to their technical restrictions, screen presentations suffer from deformations of the graphic elements. In order to produce legible maps, the map graphics have to be adapted to the screen

Evaluating a Geovisualization Prototype with Two Approaches: Remote Instructional vs. Face-to-Face Exploratory
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Two evaluations of a prototype designed to help expert users visualize key census statistics are conducted. The results yielded are compared in terms of usability issues, task completion (interaction) and ideation facilitated. Ways in which this information may be affected by the use of different data collection techniques, participants and tasks are considered. We report differences in the results of the evaluations in each of the three areas and suggest that flexible and non-disruptive methods be used to investigate whether geovisualization tools can support knowledge construction. We recommend using exploratory tasks, employing 'think aloud' strategies, requiring users to suggest and explain hypotheses and using screen capture to contextualise the data collected

Automated Schematic Mapping for MobileGIS: Technical developments and Human Factors requirements
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper looks at how human factors requirements can be considered in the context of graphic conflict reduction for mobile GIS applications. Currently this reduction is achieved by using schematic mapping techniques. With the advent of high-end miniature technology as well as digital geographic data products like OSMasterMap and OSCAR, it is essential to devise proper methodologies for map generalization specifically tailored for MobileGIS applications. This paper is concerned with the problem of producing schematic maps suitable for rendering on mobile display devices (e.g. PDAs). The application of schematic mapping can be thought of as a data reduction technique for large scale datasets to make it suitable for rendering in mobile applications. These techniques have been based on computation and have not incorporated any understanding of how the simplification affects the ease of use of the maps. It is therefore desirable to devise suitable generalization techniques incorporating human factors considerations for generating schematic maps from large scale datasets for display on small display devices to be used for MobileGIS applications

Development of a virtual heritage model to enable a comparison of active navigation with passive observation
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
In the context of urban redesign and public participation, this research project is investigating whether active exploration of a desktop virtual model of an urban environment leads to better understanding and perception than passive observation of a walkthrough of that same model. The results from the experimental study will potentially have implications for how architects and planners present their design ideas to clients and the public in the future. This paper also provides an overview of a methodology used to design, programme and enable a fully interactive virtual model of an existing built environment using the unreal runtime engine. The method emerged from a study of heritage values within the built environment, which included an assessment of the heritage values associated with the tradition of timber grass-roofed buildings and narrow passageways that make up the old town centre of Torshavn known as Tinganes

Overcoming some of the issues in maintaining large urban area 3D models via a web browser
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper discusses recent work, in the VEPs Interreg project, that has been examining how to optimise operator based digital 3D modelling, of urban and rural environments, where the increasing availability of highly accurate LiDAR scanning offers appropriate remote sensed data. From this data bare earth digital terrain models (DTMs) can be processed semi-automatically, then draped with aerial imagery. Although both the resulting DTMs and geo-referenced aerial photography are of increasing detail and availability, buildings and similar structures are difficult to automatically extract at a level of detail that provides a credible sense of presence at street level. The LiDAR data itself is currently not captured often or extensively enough or at a sufficient level of detail that it could be relied on to keep VR analogues of real places up to date through an automated process alone, without additional modelling. Significant costs in modelling and updating urban settings to convey presence thus remain, be it through a combination of photogrammetry, CAD drawings and manual editing. It is argued that these costs are likely to limit large area 3D modelling to either broad brush overviews (as provided by Google Earth) or to credible presence models in those few locations where the high cost is justifiable, but in which, once the primary purpose of the model has been served, acceptance of the continuing cost of maintenance to reflect change is unlikely. Where updating of high presence models does happen this paper puts forward the view that currently, due to cost, it is likely to be piecemeal and take place over a long period of time. The paper describes one approach to reducing these costs by empowering heterogeneous groups of people to share the tasks of digitising and updating buildings that convey a credible sense of presence

Visualisation of Architectural Design Schemes through Static Computer Generated and Traditional Visual Representations: An Investigation of Subjective Responses
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Before architects can begin to make changes in the actual physical environment they must create visual representations of design scheme proposals. Thus, in architecture, information visualisation in graphic form is crucial for discussions and for design review process of architectural design. Within the context of design research and studies there has been a growing interest in recent years in the computer methods of visual representation of architecture. This paper presents the first findings of an Economic and Social science Research Council (ESRC) funded project which explores those factors and issues which determine the perceived credibility of visual representations of architectural design. It specifically considers differences between architects' and other professionals' perceptual responses to the static forms of traditional and computer visualisation. The paper concentrates on the question: what factors are relevant to people's perceptions and which method of information visualisation is perceived as a more reliable way of visualising information about the design proposals?

Web 3D based dialogue for public participation and the VEPs Project
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
It is becoming increasingly important to European democratic governments to increase public participation. One of the areas that gives rise to significant public dissatisfaction and feelings of dis-empowerment is that of local planning. "Not in my backyard" or `NIMBYism' is now often quoted as the almost automatic response to local planning proposals. We argue that more effective tools are required to clearly display local planning proposals in Web based interactive 3D, free at the point of access. Initial workshops have shown that such tools are only likely to be used if those so doing can influence the outcome. Consensus needs to be obtained among a broad group to exert strong influence. Tools are therefore needed to share concerns, examine alternatives, and propose solutions through collaborative citizen based examination and discussion. This paper describes the development and mailing of prototype tools for this purpose in the virtual environmental planning system (VEPs) project. The focus of this paper is on tools to support collaborative dialogue and to draw attention to or to focus on specific issues in a 3D Web based interactive environment. The issues may be presented synchronously in the form of whiteboard conferencing, or asynchronously. Playback facilities for previous synchronous discussion may be useful as a record of points of agreement, and in this respect require subsequent additional more expansive description for full understanding by others. Similar tools are required to support asynchronous debate. It is suggested that effective, easy to use, to understand and review records of synchronous exchanges of views or tools for asynchronous discussion may need to create an illustrated narrative, and in this respect adopt the readily understood language of film

A Critical Review of Virtual Reality and Geographical Information Systems for Management of the Built Environment
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
In the field of urban planning, virtual reality systems are currently used as a consultation tool providing the ability to demonstrate the impact of a proposal on the environment. VR simulation models can be driven in real time by the client and adapted by the designer in response to the feedback from architects, planners and also the general public. Within the planning process, GIS systems are often used to analyse geographic data and real time VR has been used as a medium to view the results of data calculations. However, previous initiatives that have integrated VR and GIS to assist in urban planning have focused primarily on the aesthetics of development locations. This paper proposes the development framework of a novel system that allows users to interact with 3D visual data and more traditional GIS data to perform complex 'what if' scenarios in real time. The results of the queries will then be visualised not as text or 2D information, but in real time 3D

The balance between Aesthetics, Usability and Corporate Identity: Graphic User Interface design within a commercial company
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper describes the search for a balance between aesthetics, usability and corporate identity in product development. This case study shows that usability has been integrated in the process for some time now. Aesthetics and corporate identity is relatively new and not yet incorporated at the same level. Over the past three years we developed a new software style called Ocean. For the first time, as a starting point of the design process, the design team created an aesthetic concept. During the following design process, small, splintered checks are carried out on usability and on perception. However, no overall test is carried out to evaluate the perception of the product as a whole. Do our users experience the software product as professional, independent and human? Do they recognise the Oce brand they know from earlier marketing campaigns? Looking back on the Ocean design process, aesthetics proved itself to be a valid requirement. Expanding our tests with professional checks on perception would complete the embedding of aesthetics in our design process. This is a bridge that still needs to be crossed. To be able to cross this bridge we, as graphic user interface designers, need proper evaluation methods, better information and more case studies. In other words, we need backup from the information visualisation field in order to achieve this acceptance

Two sides of the story: Visualising Products and Processes in Engineering Design
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper describes research on the use of multiple views for modelling products and processes in the design of complex products. Single visual representations of design models only provide a limited perspective, hiding important information from the designer. Based on an industrial case study with an engine company, the utility of multiple views in analysing model data is demonstrated. The case study showed an industrial need for improved visualisation techniques, as the currently used method -Gantt charts of design tasks - did not provide enough information in order to properly steer the design process and predict process behaviour. This approach of using a variety of different visualisation techniques together with improved techniques for modelling and simulating design processes provides insight into the hidden dependencies between the design artefact (the product) and its design process

An Investigation into the Subjective Experience of Icons: A Pilot Study
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
In electronic applications, the graphical user interface ("GUI") contains information on many levels of visualization. The user interacts with the computer by manipulation of graphic elements on the screen, the smallest unit being the icon. This paper describes a pilot test conducted with eight students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The hypothesis is that simpler, less visually complicated icons will be understood (thus picked up) first. The more immediately communicative an icon is, the faster the response, hence, the lesser the cognitive load. An unconventional test method was used: students were asked to place user-interface icons from daily computer-use (e.g. "HOME") on a dual-axis matrix, based on their immediate reaction. Through the pilot test, the author attempted to discover the relationship between 1) visual interpretation of icons and 2) the speed in which they are understood. Results showed that there is a consistency in how the icons were interpreted visually. The results also demonstrated a relationship between an icon's design and the order in which it was picked up. Future studies will target these issues more specifically

2006
OCEAN is a tool for a posteriori visual data mining that uses the output of a text miner to help users better explore a document space. Clustered documents are transformed into a hierarchical 3D representation analog to reconfigurable disk trees. An intermediary document representation allows for interface customization and offers a generic approach to 3D structuring of text miner outputs. An interactive exploration is offered that avoids tree manipulation and provides local 2 frac12D view of the disks. A user evaluation is reported that outlines the benefit of controlled document hierarchy traversal and 2 frac12D document layout

Visualizing Distributions and Classification Accuracy
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Data mining is the search for novel, actionable information within data. It is important to note that the number of records in the data being analyzed is only one (and perhaps a small) factor in determining the complexity of a given data mining technique. Most complexity in data mining arises from the distribution of values contained in the data - not the number of records. In this paper, we utilize straightforward histogram-based visualizations to gain insight into how the performance of a well-studied data mining technique, the naive-Bayes classifier, performs under various discretization schemes for both continuous and discrete values. The resulting visualization system provides users with a tool that describes the underlying model of the data used by the classifier. Exploratory visualizations of the distributions of training data can be selected based on expert domain knowledge and then combined to apply to the test data

Existing Web usage mining (WUM) tools do not indicate which data mining algorithms are used or provide effective graphical visualizations of the results obtained. WUM techniques can be used to determine typical navigation patterns in an organizational Web site.

Many network monitoring tools do not provide sufficiently in-depth and useful reports on network usage, particularly in the domain of application services data. Application services form an integral part of organizational networks. The optimization of the performance of these networks is only possible if the networks are effectively monitored. Techniques that identify patterns of network usage can assist in the successful monitoring of network performance. The focus of this paper is on the development of a visual data mining prototype, called NetPatterns, which facilitates the effective visualization of network performance data

WSMOViz: An Ontology Visualization Approach for WSMO
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2006
The Web service modeling ontology (WSMO) is a conceptual model for creating semantic descriptions that can be used to resolve interoperability issues between Web services. These descriptions can be used to dynamically discover, compose, mediate, select and invoke web services. Tool support for WSMO is in its infancy and there is a need for tools that support the creation of WSMO descriptions and provide value added features to the users of such tools by exposing the complexities that exist within these descriptions. This paper introduces WSMOViz, an integrated ontology engineering and ontology visualization tool for WSMO, supporting the user through the ontology engineering process

A Comparative Study of Four Ontology Visualization Techniques in Protege: Experiment Setup and Preliminary Results
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
The continuing need for more effective information retrieval has lead to the creation of the notions of the semantic Web and personalized information management, areas of study that very often employ ontologies to represent the semantic context of a domain. Consequently, the need for effective ontology visualization for design, management and browsing has arisen. There are several ontology visualizations available through the existing ontology management tools, but not as many evaluations to determine their advantages and disadvantages and their suitability for various ontologies and user groups. This work presents the preliminary results of an evaluation of four visualization methods in Protege

Ontology Driven Visualisation of Maps with SVG - An Example for Semantic Programming
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This article describes a particular use of ontologies for visualising maps in a browser window. Geographic data are represented as instances of concepts in an ontology of transportation networks which was designed in close relation to GDF. These data are transformed into SVG, whereas the transformation is specified symbolically as instances of a transformation ontology. This approach is extremely flexible and easily extendible to include all kinds of information in the generated maps. The basic implementation technique is to use classes and instances of ontologies in an intelligent way. This article is an abbreviated version of the research report

AlViz - A Tool for Visual Ontology Alignment
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
We introduce a multiple-view tool called AlViz, which supports the alignment of ontologies visually. Ontologies play an important role for interoperability between organizations and for the semantic Web because they aim at capturing domain knowledge in a generic way and provide a consensual understanding of a domain. Alignment is the process where for each entity in first ontology we try to find a corresponding entity in the second ontology with the same or the closest meaning. Existing ontology alignment tools do not adequately provide a way for users to analyze the results. While many alignment tools generate lists of mappings it is difficult to analyze these alignments without examining every pairwise correspondence in the output files and even then it is an overwhelming task. We propose the use of visualization techniques to facilitate user understanding of the ontology alignment results. AlViz is implemented as a tab plug-in for Protege

Designing Usable Charts for ComplexWork Settings
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Advances in graphing applications, plug-ins and toolkits means that integrating charts and graphs into software is easier than ever before. However, selecting the optimal graphing technique for a workers task remains a difficult challenge. Information visualization experts draw on research from cognitive engineering, perceptual psychology and human computer interaction when designing displays. For the increasing number of developers who are integrating visual displays into applications, there is for a lack of a general methodology that pulls together key activities from these diverse fields. In the absence of such a methodology, it is very difficult for software developers to identify if their choice of representation satisfies both the user's tasks and perceptual limitations. We describe the approach taken in the redesign of an interactive chart used in a high volume manufacturing environment. We show how analyses of the work domain, the data and the users' tasks are all crucial steps in the design process

Adaptive Labeling for Interactive Mobile Information Systems

2006
Textual annotations are important elements in all but the simplest visual interfaces. In order to integrate textual annotations smoothly into the dynamic graphical content of interactive information systems, fast yet high-quality label layout algorithms are required. With the ongoing pervasion of mobile applications these requirements are shifted from workstations to comparatively low-performance mobile devices. Fortunately, ubiquitous network access is also on the advance, so that mobile applications can employ remote layout services on external workstations. This paper presents two novel label layout algorithms for relevance-driven dynamic visualizations in interactive information systems. They are employed to generate adaptive visualizations in a mobile maintenance support scenario

Multivariate Relational Visualization of Complex Clinical Datasets in a Critical Care Setting: A Data Visualization Interactive Prototype
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
One mission of medical informatics is to provide physicians, nurses, and other health care providers with the technology and tools for interpreting large and diverse data sets, so that appropriate critical care decisions can be facilitated. Ideally, medical data visualization provides the means to transform data into information and contextual knowledge suitable for interpretation and decision-making by Van Bemmel and Musen (1997) and Coiera (1997). The authors propose a model through which data is organized into multivariate multidimensional critical care patient data visualizations (CPDV). It does this as the primary means to represent and manage complex context-based patient data at various user-defined temporal resolutions. Furthermore, user-defined spatial organization of multiple (clinically related) datasets allows rapid visualization of significant trends that are related to several co-variables. Currently, anticipated findings from usability testing support the notion that the proposed model will facilitate medical decision making in a critical care environment

Adaptive Binary Trees Visualization with Respect to User-Specified Quality Measures
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Many algorithms have been designed to visualize binary trees efficiently with respect to a quality measure. While each algorithm is suitable for drawing particular categories of binary trees, an effort to compile these algorithms to maximize the quality of drawings has not been realized. Our first step is to create a system that determines the type of a binary tree and then selects an algorithm to draw the tree depending upon the specified quality measures. Currently, our system recognizes six types of binary trees (AVL, complete, Fibonacci, random, unbalanced-to-the-left, unbalanced-to-the-right) and allows the user to choose from eleven quality measures (area, aspect ratio, total edge length, maximum edge length, uniform edge length, closest leaf, farthest leaf, size, minimum angle size, average angle size, angular resolution). Experiments show that our adaptive visualization system outperforms any system using a single binary tree drawing algorithm. In addition, our approach allows the user to select multiple quality measures and automatically detects the best available binary tree drawing algorithm

Unification and Evaluation of Graph Drawing Algorithms for Different Application Domains
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Today formalisms with graphical representations are used to model structure, behavior, and other views on software and systems. The UML is just one example for modeling languages with graphical representation of its models. Although most models are executable without explicit graphical information of the model's elements, the appearance of a model is of particular importance for its readability. To improve the so called embedding of a graph representing a model or to create a initial embedding, an algorithmic support for arranging the elements is useful. We provide a software environment in which layout algorithms can be developed and evaluated. By defining proper interfaces for graph elements, we provide easy access to our library of layout algorithms for external use

Maintaining a Random Binary Search Tree Dynamically
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Binary tree is a graph, without cycle, that is frequently used in computer science for fast data access and retrieval. To ensure faster insertion and deletion, the tree height has to be kept to a minimum. A random tree starts loosing its randomness after a series of insertions and deletions and, in the worst case, a tree with n nodes, could grow up to the height of n - 1. In this paper, we present modified insertion and deletion algorithms to maintain the tree in better shape dynamically. Without applying any complex rebalancing technique, or using considerable amount of space, both algorithms maintain the tree in such a way that even a series of insertions and asymmetric deletions do not cause the tree to grow beyond n/2. A comparative study of traditional and modified insert algorithms shows that for random input, the modified insert algorithm produces a tree with 20% to 30% reduction in height, forcing the average number of comparisons required for a successful search to go down by 15% to 20%

Metabolic network visualization using constraint planar graph drawing algorithm
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
A metabolic network is a set of interconnected metabolic pathways (subnetworks). Until recently, metabolic studies were dedicated to a single pathway, but current researches now consider the entire network. As matter stands, existing visualization tools cannot be used to undertake these global studies since they have been designed to probe metabolic pathways. For the purpose of making it feasible, this paper presents a graph drawing algorithm for the whole metabolic network. Our collaboration with biologists led us to introduce drawing constraints which take into account the decomposition of the network into metabolic pathways as well as biochemical textbook drawing conventions. These constraints raise numerous graph drawing problems which are solved by first recursively decomposing the network then applying suitable graph drawing algorithms. Finally, we present an application that illustrates the advantage of this representation when visualizing groups of reactions which span several metabolic pathways

A Graph Theoretic Framework for Trust - From Local to Global
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2006
Traditional approaches to trust, be it in agent-based societies, or within a more theoretical framework often consider trust to be a local phenomenon. Here we propose that trust should be viewed from a global perspective. Our motivation is the area of pervasive computing although we believe that our formal framework applies in many domains. Here we present our framework and formalize it in the form of graph theory. We present some open problems and discuss the wider application of our work

Efficient Multicast Algorithms for Mesh-connected Multicomputers
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Performance of multicomputers largely depends on that of the underlying network communications such as multicast. Two major parameters used to evaluate multicast routing are the time it takes to deliver the message to all destinations and the traffic which refers to the total number of links involved. Mesh is a network topology widely used in multicomputers. It has been proved that, in mesh network, it is NP-hard to find the multicast routing which is optimal on both time and traffic. In this paper, we proposed two efficient multicast algorithms designed for store-and-forward switched mesh-connected multicomputers: DIAG and DDS. They are both tree-based shortest path multicast algorithms whose complexity is O(KN) or less. Performance evaluations of these algorithms resulted from simulations are given at the end

A Deterministic Multidimensional Scaling Algorithm for Data Visualisation

2006
In this paper, we present I-PACK, a deterministic layout algorithm for embedding a data set X in 2D provided that distances (delta<sub>uv </sub>)<sub>u,visinX</sub>, between data items are given or can be computed. The layout reflects well similarities and dissimilarities between items and it is computed in quasi-linear time. Experimental comparisons with other multidimensional scaling algorithms show that: i) our algorithm has similar performance when the aspect ratio A = max<sub>u,v</sub>)(delta<sub>uv</sub>)/ min<sub>u,v</sub>)(delta<sub>uv</sub>) is small (i.e. log<sub>2</sub>A &lt; 10) and ii) the larger the aspect ratio, the better I-PACK performs with respect to other MDS algorithms. This is also true when data can be "naturally" clustered

Broadcasting in Optimal Bipartite Double Loop Graphs
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2006
Double loop graphs are extensions of the ring topology which are obtained by regularly adding 2 extra edges per vertex. An optimal graph of diameter d has the maximum possible number of vertices. The optimal structure of double loop graphs, as well as the broadcast time and an optimal broadcast scheme are known. In this paper, we define the family of bipartite double loop graphs (BDLG) G = (V, E) where V = V<sub>0</sub> cup V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>0</sub> cap V<sub>1</sub> = phi and |V<sub>0</sub>| = |V<sub>1</sub>|. We show that the maximum number of vertices that a BDLG of diameter d can have is 2d2. We also study the broadcast problem and find that the broadcast time is d + 2. Finally we present an optimal broadcast scheme for these bipartite double loop graphs

A computer recognizes the states of the user-handled objects in real time and it gives the users advice to execute learning tasks if necessary. In our approach, a pattern block is employed as a primitive piece. It helps the users to do direct manipulation in real environments, while displayed events in virtual environments help them to support the learning tasks. Concretely, we have developed the interaction system can support hands-on math activities

There are many deficiencies in the traditional electronic commerce schema. The main problem for consideration is the text and picture based design that underpins current HTML systems. This paper presents the online grocery shopping system called Easy Grocery which is available at www.easygrocery.co.uk. This system is based on the innovative concept of using a 3D system as an interface to the user during their shopping experience. Furthermore, this 3D system follows the mental model of the user as opposed to that of the developer. Additionally, the user is able to select the layout of the online store so that it matches the layout of their local store, thus enabling even new users to exploit their own knowledge of how items are organized to shop efficiently. The Easy Grocery system demonstrates that 3D online shopping can provide significant advantages for both consumers and retailers

Real Time Multimodal Interaction with Animated Virtual Human
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2006
This paper describes the design and implementation of a real time animation framework in which animated virtual human is capable of performing multimodal interactions with human user. The animation system consists of several functional components, namely perception, behaviours generation, and motion generation. The virtual human agent in the system has a complex underlying geometry structure with multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs). It relies on a virtual perception system to capture information from its environment and respond to human user's commands by a combination of non-verbal behaviours including co-verbal gestures, posture, body motions and simple utterances. A language processing module is incorporated to interpret user's command. In particular, an efficient motion generation method has been developed to combines both motion captured data and parameterized actions generated in real time to produce variations in agent's behaviours depending on its momentary emotional states

With powerful graphics hardware becoming affordable for everyone, there is an increasing tendency towards a new generation of user interfaces, with the focus shifting from traditional two-dimensional desktops to three-dimensional virtual environments. Therefore, there is a growing need for applicable immersive interaction metaphors to manipulate these environments. In our paper we propose a gesture recognition engine using an inexpensive data glove with integrated 6 DOF tracking. Despite of noisy input data from the glove, we are able to achieve reliable and flexible gesture recognition. New gestures can be trained easily and existing gestures can be individually adapted for different users

Dynamic Visualization and Navigation of Semantic Virtual Environments

Although information visualization claims to provide the means to induce mental models of any kind of data, the visualization of semantic information is still an open field of research. Existing approaches either concentrate on the visualization of documents without additional metadata or produce unintuitive expert graphics. This paper seeks to fill this gap by presenting a semantic information visualization system with a dynamic 3D interface and intuitive metaphors. The application called DocuWorld visualizes documents, document meta-data, and semantic relations between documents. The general visualization and navigation metaphor called Thought Wizard Metaphor allows user- and context-sensitive adaption of visualization modes and visualization environments

Tactile Glyphs for Palpation of Relationships
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
We propose the use of tactile glyphs to represent abstract information such as hierarchical relationships. A tactile glyph uses vibro-tactile feedback to the fingers and palm of the hand. By comparing two tactile glyphs, one for each hand, one can understand the relationships between the information that the glyphs represent. The use of tactile glyph comparison does not require remembering complex stimulus patterns; it only needs that some simple rules are learned. Although a limited number of stimuli can be provided to one hand, techniques for mapping hierarchical information to a pattern and using a sequence of tactile feedback enable the representation of relationships in a large hierarchy. Experimental evaluations were conducted to clarify the features of the tactile glyphs. The experimental evaluations suggested that the tactile glyphs can be used to represent hierarchical relationships and for palpation of relationships

Towards Adaptive Occlusion Culling Using Camera Coherence
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2006
Occlusion culling proves to be useful for the interactive visualization of environments that are not densely occluded. Those which are built up by dense geometric sets like aerospace engines composed of thousands of components and millions of polygons. In first place the convenience of using occlusion culling is studied with a simple scheme. Then improvements are analyzed. The key points to obtain frame rate speed-ups are: a convenient occlusion query scheduling provides the performance required; depth sorting is performed only when camera orientation changes more than a given threshold; coherence reduces the number of occlusion queries posted per frame. It is possible to select the percentage of occlusion queries that will be performed in each frame, from non-conservative schemes up to a conservative one. Furthermore, we propose a small addition to the GPU occlusion queries to perform faster renderings

Telepresence Across Networks: A Combined Deadband and Prediction Approach
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Executing telepresence operations across networks poses a number of challenges. In particular, the transfer of certain data types requires high sampling rates, such as haptic and velocity data. This paper presents a two-step approach which reduces the total amount of data sent across a network, while attempting to reconstruct the original data series. The first step utilises a deadband approach to eliminate the transfer of redundant data. In this sense, redundant refers to the fact that the data will be undetectable or of no consequence at the receiving end. The second step is a prediction implementation to best reconstruct the reduced series to its original form. This combined deadband and prediction approach is applied to velocity data extracted from a telepresence scenario, resulting in an 86% reduction in the amount of data transferred, and good data reconstruction properties

FFT and Convolution Performance in Image Filtering on GPU
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Many contemporary visualization tools comprise some image filtering approach. Since image filtering approaches are very computationally demanding, the acceleration using graphics-hardware (GPU) is very desirable to preserve interactivity of the main visualization tool itself. In this article we take a close look on GPU implementation of two basic approaches to image filtering -fast Fourier transform (frequency domain) and convolution (spatial domain). We evaluate these methods in terms of the performance in real time applications and suitability for GPU implementation. Convolution yields better performance than fast Fourier transform (FFT) in many cases; however, this observation cannot be generalized. In this article we identify conditions under which the FFT gives better performance than the corresponding convolution and we assess the different kernel sizes and issues of application of multiple filters on one image

An Error-Resilient Algorithm Based on Partitioning of the Wavelet Transform Coefficients for a DIRAC Video Codec
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Video transmission over the wireless or wired network require protection from channel errors since compressed video streams are very sensitive to transmission errors because of the use of predictive coding and variable length coding. In this paper, we propose a method to achieve robustness to transmission errors to the compressed bit-stream of wavelet based open source video codec, Dirac. By partitioning the wavelet transform coefficients into groups and independently processing each group using arithmetic and turbo coding, we could achieve the robustness to transmission errors of the compressed video stream in the packet erasure wired network. Simulation results show that the proposed technique can achieve up to 5dB PSNR gain over the un-partitioning method

3D Graph Visualisation of Web Normal and Malicious Traffic
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2006
Once a Web site has been made operational by a company, organisation or individual there is a wish to know the details regarding the connections to the site. In addition, there is a great interest to monitor the activity profile of the Web site in terms of how many hits are received, where they come from, the relationship between this activity and increased revenues of the business and so on. Due to the complexity and volume of data involved in these tasks the only way to manage all of the information is to present it using a visual paradigm. Furthermore, Web sites are likely to be regularly scanned and attacked by both automated and manual means. Companies, organisations and individuals are making every effort to build and maintain secure Web sites. In this paper we will present an ongoing surveillance prototype system which offers a visual aid to the Web analyst by monitoring and exploring 3D graphs. The system offers a visual surveillance of the Web traffic for both normal and malicious activity. Web requests are presented as 3D directed graphs. Colours are used on the 3D graphics to indicate malicious attempts or anomalous traffic and the analyst has the ability to perform visual data analysis by navigating online into the Web request payload, of either normal or malicious traffic

This paper describes an action research project based on the process of designing the visualisation of heart and breath rate data for the interactive artwork Cardiomorphologies. The project aimed to realise the affective goals of the artist as closely as possible by studying the audience experience of the visualisations and incorporating the findings into an iterative design process. The qualities of richness and ambiguity were found to contribute to the achievement of the artists' two major aims: 1) to create a sense of integrated physical and mental engagement with the work and 2) to create a reflective state in which participants consider correlations between their thoughts and specific physiological states

The Art of Gemotion in Space
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Gemotion explores the potential innovation in the convergence of the media content industry and traditional culture that may become more commonplace in the future. In this paper, I will discuss a few examples of such collaborative efforts. Above all, I would like to take this opportunity to look at the issue of how the five senses - particularly, sight, sound and touch - which form the key elements of virtual reality, relate to traditional performing arts. From there, I hope to shed light on the signs emerging on the horizon of future media content

Curating Digital Media-Next Generation of Japanese Media Art &amp;amp; Exhibition
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
In 1960s, Japanese digital artists were already introduced internationally by their pioneering works. In 2002, digital/media art became the required course of junior-high/high school art classes, and digital art expressions including computer graphics have been in the ascendant to show the broader diversity than ever. Like other Asian countries, government has started supporting the media art contents and today's Japanese art students, whose works have been highly evaluated even overseas, to enter a new phase. I would like to report on the current situations of media art education and support system for media art in Japan and consider the future of upcoming talents, by examining examples; Japan Media Arts Festival and also quote the experience of many exhibitions on media art for over ten years, at the Images &amp; technology Gallery in Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, which founded as a public institution of image media

Interactive Web based Grid Geometry Construction
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Conventionally, a grid generator requires either explicit or without explicit description about the boundary vertices, boundary lines and boundary faces to define the geometry, whereby a CAD system or an anisotropic grid generation with intersection-based geometry interface can be deployed to generate grids. Whatever the case, this compute intensive process, quite often, has a non-interactive, non-Web-based interface and without instant visualization. While grid generator can be used to generate grid geometry art, any 2D image editing program can also be deployed, nevertheless, the result is a static display of a pixel- or vector-based image. This paper describes an interactive Web-based visualization as a fundamental medium for visualization, one that changes the way grid geometry art are being visualized, developed, generated and delivered. The author first provides relevant background of grid geometry art, discusses several existing methodologies and their inadequacy currently used within the Web environments. She offers a new paradigm - a Web-based interactive development tool that integrates an interface for exploration, structuring and dissemination of visualization results for grid geometry art. Such is an instant conceptualization and artistic interpretation of an image as an arrangement of an uniform m times n grid of colored cells: quadrilaterals formed within a set of finite orthogonal grids. The parameter-driven algorithm with minimal user setup for "automatic" idea generation provides the tools for constructing De Stijl, abstraction geometry - concentric squares geometrical objects from numerical arrays not only makes and manipulates, it distributes geometric shapes over planes, as well as performs color and rectangular shape transformations. The author briefly discusses the tool, demonstrates and renders specific examples of the art thus created as she illustrates the advantages of using a single tool to embrace the structuring and delivery of a garden variety of grid geometry art

Distorted Conversations: On and Offline Explorations of Genomic Art
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper explores the metaphors of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), or the genetic engineering of human embryos, through genomic art. Conversations about technologies like PGD typically center on issues of genetic determinism and autonomy. "Distorted conversations" exposes these issues by pushing the metaphor of ethical determinism as expressed through anonymous "conversations" distorted through online isolation and offline visualization technology. Participants are invited to contribute their hopes and concerns about this technology on a blog site. Portions of these conversations are converted into minuscule text and adhered to petri dishes that would typically be used during PGD procedures. Observers are then invited to join in this distorted conversation through the aid of a microscope. In this way, the conversation mimics the actual procedures of PGD and every aspect of the online and offline portions of the piece are controlled by and manipulated through PGD-type technology

Between Art and Architecture: The Interactive Skin
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
There are two current approaches to the realisation of interactive building 'skins': in architecture so called intelligent facades are being designed with an environmental science agenda; while in a parallel line of inquiry, artists are experimenting with media facades. It is proposed here that there is common ground between reactive environmental facades and data driven screens, in that both involve the design of kinetic process. Selected examples from kinetic and generative art provide useful precursors for such an approach and these provide the background to a framework for the design of interactive building skins. The aim is to locate the design parameters for practice where the art/architectural skin is a process based system, rather than a static object

Augmented Reality Visualisation of the Built Environment To Support Design Decision Making
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper reviews current approaches to design visualization in the built environment and establishes a gap in theory and practice. While it has been acknowledged for some time that the temporal component is an important aspect of visualisation there has been minimal attempts to integrate this approach into design practice. We articulate an approach to visualization which we term 'temporal context'. This approach has two aspects: (1) the evaluation of designs in terms of spatial sequence and multiple viewpoints over time; (2) perceptual change over time due to changing light and atmospheric conditions. Building on our previous research in the use of video game technology to facilitate design, we evaluate the potential of augmented reality (AR) technology to address temporal context. We describe proposals for two innovative screen based AR systems, which incorporate a multi-camera capture mechanism, a video data base and a unique illumination data capture approach

Liquid Architectures: Marcos Novak's Territory of Information
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
The contemporary idea for interaction has embraced new understandings of the content of experience and the structure of space. New electronic technologies and advanced digital media have separated realities from the realm of the body and transformed experiences into ubiquitous events. The architectural discourse, once largely a discourse of form and style, has overcome these limitations and encountered, in territories of information, the product of a new way of thinking. Marcos Novak emerges in this context of multimedia as an innovative creator whose "liquid architectures" represent a break with the traditional discourse of physicality. His creations are meant for a virtual domain, and information is what structures this new territory for architectural practice. With respect to Novak's structures, the approaches to virtual spaces posited by scholars of new media culture over the past few decades, either through phenomenological aspects of the bodily existence and modes of experience or through the poststructural metaphoric manifestation of codes and symbols, do not suffice. While Novak's work does embrace both philosophies, it also transcends them by crossbreeding the reality of the individual with the virtuality of the structure. Indeed, his architectures require a new concept of space to come forward, where the manifestation of the mind in the realm of the body calls for what is to be perceived as real. Architecture is now characterized by the fusion of information, art, and technology

Long live the new video flesh after videodrome Envisioning mutable surfaces for architecture
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper describes a system of a dynamic and interactive environment taking inspiration in the 1983 film by David Cronenberg entitled "Videodrome". The movie thereby provides a metaphor for proposing an embodied interface merging video from a physical realm into digital form in real time through an "emotion detector". The main challenge is to detect emotional states of the physical reality and translate them into the digital dimension in real time. The main objective of the project is to test possibilities to turn it into an emotive mutable and permanent membrane for an architectural surface in a near future. This paper also seeks out to reflect on the growing interest in integrating media elements into architecture and how these new emerging principles are creating non traditional material-realities

Enhanced High Dimensional Data Visualization through Dimension Reduction and Attribute Arrangement
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Researchers and users are well aware of the difficulties related to finding an appropriate configuration of the axes mapping attributes in multidimensional visualization techniques, particularly in visualizations that show a large number of attributes simultaneously. We address this problem with a simple strategy that offers both dimension ordering and dimension reduction. Dimension ordering is based on attribute similarity heuristics, and the basic rationale is extended to support dimension reduction. We discuss the performance of our algorithms and present some results of their application to several data sets. The algorithms improve the capability of visualization techniques to segregate clusters present in the data and reduce the visual clutter aggravated by arbitrary distributions of the axes

Reviewing Data Visualization: an Analytical Taxonomical Study
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper presents an analytical taxonomy that can suitably describe, rather than simply classify, techniques for data presentation. Unlike previous works, we do not consider particular aspects of visualization techniques, but their mechanisms and foundational vision perception. Instead of just adjusting visualization research to a classification system, our aim is to better understand its process. For doing so, we depart from elementary concepts to reach a model that can describe how visualization techniques work and how they convey meaning

Stimulation Spectrum Based High-dimensional Data Visualization
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
One of the main goals of high-dimensional data visualization is to reduce dimensions, so that the data can be projected onto 2D or 3D space. This paper proposes a stimulation spectrum based visualization approach, in which each high-dimension data is regarded as a stimulation spectrum and the change of each value of data attribute corresponds to the change of wavelength of visible spectrum. According to the relationship between stimulation spectrum and color space, we can project high-dimensional data onto 3-dimensional space, and easily observe the distribution of the data. We also demonstrate this novel approach with synthetic data and real data, and the result is very promising

Registration of Multiple Laser Scans Based on 3D Contour Features
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
When 3D laser scanner captures range data of real scenes, one of most important problems is how to align all range data into a common coordinate system. In this paper, we propose an algorithm of registration of multiple range data from real scenes using 3D contour features. Firstly, 3D contour features are extracted using self-adaptive curve fitting, and a searching structure of octree is built from the 3D contour features. Secondly, using Mahalanobis distance, the leaf nodes are matched between two scans to compute original transform matrix, and then transform matrix is refined step by step through ICP until a best transform matrix is obtained. Lastly, a new global registration strategy is given based on the nearby principle. The experiments of multiple range data registration from indoor scenes, outdoor scenes and ancient buildings are done, and the results show the proposed algorithm is robust

POLARMAP - Efficient Visualisation of High Dimensional Data
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Multidimensional scaling provides low-dimensional visualisation of high-dimensional feature vectors. This is a very important step in data preprocessing because it helps the user to appraise which methods to use for further data analysis. But a well known problem with conventional MDS is the quadratic need of space and time. Beside this, a transformation of MDS must be completely recomputed if additional feature vectors have to be considered. The POLARMAP algorithm, presented in this paper, learns a function, similar to NeuroScale, but with lower computational costs, that maps high-dimensional feature vectors to a 2-dimensional feature space. With the obtained function even new feature vectors can be mapped to the target space

Natural Textures for Weather Data Visualization
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
In this paper we present a novel method to visualize weather data with multi-layer controllable texture synthesis. Texture possesses multiple principal perceptual channels, which makes it good at encoding multiple data attributes contained in weather data. The natural textures existed in the real world especially provide plenty of choices to encode the data with visually pleasing images. A controllable texture synthesis method is developed to generate a large amount of textures which change the appearances of their individual perceptual dimensions according to the underlying distribution of data attributes. In order to encode more data attributes we further propose multi-layer texture synthesis. The background and foreground textures are separately synthesized and then combined together for display. In the end, we apply our method to some real-world weather data and demonstrate its effectiveness with a user study

GPU Rendering of the Thin Film on Paints with Full Spectrum
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Spectrum-based rendering uses spectral distributions instead of just three RGB colors for representation of light sources and surface properties in rendering equation. Since, spectrum has a value at every visible wavelength, the spectrum-based rendering gives much accurate color computation compared to RGB-based rendering and it give us opportunity to simulate wavelength dependent phenomena and effects caused by spectrum difference. We introduce a novel framework for spectrum-based rendering on GPU (graphics processing unit) to compute local illumination. On this framework, the Phong reflectance model is implemented employing the spectral power distribution of light source and the spectral reflectance of surface simulating the color rendition of light sources and metamerism of surfaces. Multilayered thin film interference effects can also be handled within this framework with interactive speeds. Additionally, we propose the area light source defined by the spectral cube environment map and show the method for conversion of RGB environment map into a spectral one

Preserving the Volume of Fluid Using Multi-phase Flow Approach
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Methods to animate multiphase fluids are rarely researched, although such phenomena are common in our daily lives. The main focus of this research is to develop a suitable method to create realistic animation of multiphase flows, i.e. flow of fluid mixtures. Our method is based on Navier-Stokes equations, a set of physical equations that describe motion of fluid. A marker-and-cell (MAC) grid is used to solve the equations on discrete computational domain. To simulate several fluids, we propose the modification of volume-of-fluid (VOF) representation of fluid and integrate it into the multiphase-fluid approach. A mixture of fluids is treated as a single fluid having variable density and viscosity. This scheme allows two or more fluids having different densities and viscosities to be simulated simultaneously

Dynamic Cloth Animation in Virtual Environments
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Dynamic cloth animation is an important problem in virtual reality, in which the reality and real-time effect becomes the main problem to resolve. To achieve the reality of animation, two aspects of research have been done. The mass-spring model is one of the main adopted models, but it has the "super elastic" effect. In this paper, compared to the previous method of deal with this problem, a feasible method is proposed. Besides, how to design wind is also a key problem, in this paper, a function and an algorithm for wind is also proposed. To achieve the real-time effect, the idea of bounding boxes hierarchy is applied in collision detection and self-collision detection. For collision detection, the authors describes a detailed algorithm; for self-collision, art algorithm is described that convert collision detection to self-collision detection. The simulation is executed with an average PC, and a live real-time result is achieved

Developing a Parametric Approach for 3D Modelling Software
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
The creation of 3D models is generally considered by newcomers to be a difficult activity requiring a number of skills and considerable practice. This paper describes work in the INHERIT project which aims to address these issues by providing a 3D modelling tool set which is easy to use, requiring few skills and little practice. This is achieved by the development of software tools which are customised to build particular types of model. The key aspect of these tools is the treatment of the underlying data of the 3D model as a tree structure of nodes which consist of parameterised representations of the components of the object being modelled. The tools then automatically generate the graphics primitives that enable the visualisation and interaction with the object. This paper describes the implementation of the first tool created following this principle which enables school children to model church structures

Sketchy Illustrations for Presenting the Design of Interactive CSG
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Illustrating in a sketchy manner is essential to communicate visual ideas and can be used to present and reconsider drafts and concepts in product design. This paper introduces a real-time illustration technique that sketches the design and spatial assembly of CSG models. The illustration technique generates a graphical decomposition of the CSG model into disjunctive layers to extract 1) the perceptually important edges that outline the model's outer and inner features and 2) the surface shading of the outer and inner faces. Then, the technique applies uncertainty to these layers to simulate a sketchy effect. Finally, the technique composes the sketched layers in depth-sorted order while ensuring a correct depth behavior in the frame buffer. Because the sketchy illustrations are frame-to-frame coherent, the technique can be used as a tool for interactive presentation and reconsideration of the design and spatial assembly of CSG models

A Projection-Based Multi-view Time-multiplexed Autostereoscopic 3D Display System
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
This paper presents our implementation of a multi-view autostereoscopic 3D display system by using time-multiplexing approach, digital micro-mirror devices (DMD), and the optical Wedgereg. The whole system consists of three major parts: high frame rate DMD projector, an active shutter, and an optical Wedgereg. This research investigates and develops the approaches to interface and control DMDs at very high bit rates and ultra-high frame rates to drive a novel flicker-free 3D flat panel device, with a wide viewing area and without need of special viewing glasses or head-tracking system. It needs to design a digital interface circuit capable of receiving video image data in a conventional format and translating it into a form appropriate for display on a DMD light modulator. This approach differs from existing ones in that it facilitates the modulation of the DMD to achieve much high frame rates, though with a trade-off in greyscale resolution. The outcomes of this research will have the great potential for commercialising the autostereoscopic display systems

Realistic Rendering and Animation of a Multi-Layered Human Body Model
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
A framework for realistic rendering of a multi-layered human body model is proposed in this paper. The human model is composed of three layers: skeleton, muscle, and skin. The skeleton layer, represented by a set of joints and bones, controls the animation of the human body using inverse kinematics. Muscles are represented with action lines that are defined by a set of control points. An action line applies the force produced by a muscle on the bones and on the skin mesh. The skin layer is modeled as a 3D mesh and deformed during animation by binding the skin layer to both the skeleton and muscle layers. The skin is deformed by a two-step algorithm according to the current state of the skeleton and muscle layers. Performance experiments show that it is possible to obtain real-time frame rates for a moderately complex human model containing approximately 33,000 triangles on the skin layer

A Facial Aging Simulation Method Using flaccidity deformation criteria
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
Due to the fact that the aging human face encompasses skull bones, facial muscles, and tissues, we render it using the effects of flaccidity through the observation of family groups categorized by sex, race and age. Considering that patterns of aging are consistent, facial ptosis becomes manifest toward the end of the fourth decade. In order to simulate facial aging according to these patterns, we used surfaces with control points so that it was possible to represent the effect of aging through flaccidity. The main use of these surfaces is to simulate flaccidity and aging consequently

Daisies on Mars: disseminating scientific information by use of developmental animation
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation

2006
The sciences often find it difficult to present complex ideas to audiences in ways that are informative and interesting. This is problematic, when the public needs to enter into a debate about new ideas, during conferences when vast amounts of information on diverse subjects are presented in a very short time, and in lectures when experts present fundamental principles to novices. Given our relatively short attention spans, boredom thresholds and limited capacity to assimilate new information, it is essential that the medium is an effective conveyor of the message, and in itself helps the receiver to remain alert and focused whilst also presenting information in a clear and unambiguous manner. The development of a new area of research, cogent computing, provided an opportunity to produce an effective, animation-based information communication tool, in the form of an application scenario, to be used for communicating to students, wider audiences and the design and development team itself, technical aspects of pervasive computing

2006
In this paper we present the redesign of the user interface of the InterLearning software. InterLearning is an in-house developed e-learning software that has been in use for the last 3 years at our College. The software was developed by a team of computer scientists. InterLearning has been evaluated by both students and faculty since its development, in terms of the functionality that it offers. It has subsequently been enhanced based on the feedback of the users. The software has only started to be used by some Design faculty and students this year. Our experience from its use within this Department has revealed the need for redesigning its interface. Both students and faculty have expressed some negative views with regards to the screen layouts, menus, icons, colours, textual representations and fonts used. Based on this feedback, we have redesigned the interface taking also into consideration feedback obtained during the redesign stages from some Design faculty members and Design students. This paper presents the results of the evaluation of the existing interface by faculty members and students and describes the new interface designed by a team of graphic designers based on the feedback obtained

2006
We have developed a system that informs lecturers regarding real-time learning situations in the classroom and helps them provide support for students (novice programmers) experiencing common problems. This system has two functions. The first is a program animation function which keeps a historical record of the students' operations, and analyses this record to provide the information about difficulty of program actions to lecturers. The second is a compile-error support function which keeps a historical record of the students' errors, and then analyses this record and informs the lecturer about the correspondence between compile-error causes and particular lines of source code. This system should provide lecturers with full support and real-time solutions to common problems faced by students

The study investigated the effects of position (upper, below, right-hand, and left-hand side of the screen) for VDT dynamic display and other factors including speed (150, 200, 250, and 300 wpm), display type of dynamic information (leading, flash and RSVP), and polarity combination of dynamic/static (black-on-white/black-on-white, white-on-black/white-on-black, black-on-white/white-on-black, and white-on-black/black-on-white) on subjects' comprehension for reading static and dynamic display information. The result of this research showed that position and type of dynamic information had no significant effect on subjects' comprehension for dynamic and static information. Polarity combination and speed also had no significant effect on subjects' comprehension for static information; however, the two factors had significant effects on subjects' comprehension for dynamic information. When display speed was set at 200 wpm, subjects' comprehension was better than with at speed settings. When the dynamic/static display was set to be the same polarity combination (black-on-white/black-on-white), subjects' performance was better than other polarity combinations

The Making of Trigger and the Agile Engineering of Artist-Scientist Collaboration
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
The agile process approach used in software engineering was adapted as a foundation for the management of the multimedia art installation project titled "Trigger." By beginning with requirements engineering and risk management assessments, instead of rigid planning, the project was designed with flexibility that allowed for iterative adjustment. The residency period drew the artist, Jody Zellen, and the computer scientists together for agile learning by the processes of doing and testing. This style of management allowed the group to act decisively with incomplete information, thereby successfully finishing the project in time to meet a rigid deadline

Changing Visual Practices
Tenth International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2006
In emerging theoretical models of innovation, digital simulation and prototyping tools are described as new means of production. However, relatively little is known about how such digital tools are used in construction and other industrial contexts, in particular how they are changing visual practices. In this paper, we present a study of the changes associated with interactive 3D technologies between 1990 and 2005 and we situate the findings in the context of innovation theory. With an empirical focus on the construction and film/television industries, our study is based both on the analysis of articles in trade publications and on interviews with key stakeholders. The dataset suggests that aspirations for these technologies are closely linked to their role as means of production; however, new practices also develop around the technologies as ends. We highlight preliminary implications of this study for industry, and give suggestions for further research in this area

Visually Mining the Datacube using a Pixel-Oriented Technique
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper introduces a new technique easing the navigation and interactive exploration of huge multidimensional datasets. Following the pixel-oriented paradigm [8], the key ingredients enabling the interactive navigation of extreme volumes of data rely on a set of functions bijectively mapping data elements to screen pixels. The use of the mapping from data elements to pixels constrain the computational complexity for the rendering process to be linear with respect to the number of rendered pixels on the screen as opposed to the dataset size. Our method furthermore allows the implementation of usual information visualization techniques such as zoom and pan, anamorphosis and texturing. As a proof-of-concept, we show how our technique can be adapted to interactively explore the Datacube, turning our approach into an efficient system for visual datamining. We report experiments conducted on a Datacube containing 50 millions of items. To our knowledge, our technique outperforms all existing ones and push the scalability limit close to the billion of elements. Supporting all basic navigation techniques, and being moreover flexible makes it easily reusable for a large number of applications.

Tracking and Organizing Visual Exploration Activities across Systems and Tools
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Modern knowledge discovery activities occur in highly dynamic environments. Specific activities may involve multiple tools, techniques, systems, individuals, and locations. In addition to these complexities, the span of time involved with discovery may vary from short to long, as well as being contiguous or disjoint. This paper presents a framework for tracking the history, or provenance, of the discovery process across applications, systems, and users. The resulting capabilities provide fine-grained provenance information relative to the discovered information. Along with the provenance framework, a prototype system is used to demonstrate the main concepts of the proposed approach.

Imago: An integrated prototyping, evaluation and transitioning environment for information visualisation
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper introduces Imago, an environment that supports the prototyping, evaluation and transitioning of information visualisation approaches into practice. The approach is based on the use of an underlying semantic model of contextual and visualisation knowledge and integrated evaluation capabilities to aid the transitioning process. We discuss the use of Imago in relation to our experiences in researching and providing information visualisation approaches for command and control activities.

PRISMA - A Multidimensional Information Visualization Tool Using Multiple Coordinated Views
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Information visualization techniques have been successfully used to build visual and interactive analysis of data and data relationships. However, dimensionality, volume and diversity make it difficult for a single technique to completely solve the problem. Information visualization tools that support multiple coordinated views allow the user to better understand the dataset by providing different perspectives based on the same set of data items. These tools support the correlation between data views and the coordinated real-time interaction mechanisms. The goal of this paper is to present the PRISMA information visualization tool that explores the use of multiple coordinated views. PRISMA provides usability, portability and extensibility. Initial usability essays are discussed.

Information Visualization of Multi-dimensional Cellular Automata using GPU Programming
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
We propose a method for generating all possible rules of multi-dimension Boolean cellular automata (CA). Based on an original encoding method and the programming of graphical processor units (GPU), this method allows us to visualize the CA information flow in real-time so that emerging behaviors can be easily identified. Algorithms of first and von Neumann neighborhood second degrees are detailed with their respective fragment shaders programs. As symmetrical CA rules are especially useful in many research fields, we propose an encoding technique to automatically derive their codes; we then apply this technique to identify the 4096 possible cases for surface CA. To show the efficiency of our model a set of converging global behaviors are listed and described. In the last part of the paper we present methods for developing Moore neighborhood in two and in three dimensions. Finally we discuss issues concerning computation and the visualization of non-Boolean and higher dimension CA.

A Fast Algorithm for Balanced Graph Clustering
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Scalability problem is a long-lasting challenge for both information visualization and graph drawing communities. Available graph visualization techniques could perform well for small or medium size graphs but they are rarely able to handle very large and complex graphs. One of effective approach to solve this problem is to employ graph abstraction; that is to hierarchically partitioning the complete graph into a clustered graph. A graph visualization technique is then applied to display the abstract view of this clustered graph with partially displayed detail of one or a few sub-graphs where the user is currently focusing on. This reduces the complexity of display and makes it easier for users to interpret, perceive and navigate the large scale information. In this paper, we propose a graph clustering method which can quickly discover the community structure embedded in large graphs and partition the graph into densely connected sub-graphs. The proposed algorithm can not only run fast, but also achieve a consistent partitioning result in which a graph is divided into a set of clusters of the similar size in terms of their visual complexity and the number of nodes and edges. In addition, we also provide a mechanism to partition very dense graphs in which the number of edges is much larger than the number of nodes.

Balloon Views of Source Code and Their Multiscalable Font Modes
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
The majority of program editors available on the market support the view of a directory-explorer style to display only those code lines of interest. Among them, the fisheye and the fractal views of source code (in which each line has a value reflecting the degree of interest and importance) have received a lot of attention in the literature. In information visualization, drawing trees based on fractal theory also plays an interesting role as the so-called balloon drawing of hierarchical data includes two models: the fractal and the SNS (subtrees with nonuniform sizes) models. It is therefore natural to consider a new source code visualization style based on the SNS model of balloon drawing. A main feature of the SNS view is that the value of each line reflects the number of its descendants when the source code is viewed as a tree structure. Unlike the view of a directory- explorer style, the multiscalable font mode (which was originally utilized in the fractal view of source code) displays all the lines in such a way that each line has the font size proportional to its value. In this paper, we investigate various issues concerning the multiscalable font modes of the fish- eye, the fractal, and the SNS views of source code, in hope of providing guidelines for the programmer to better comprehend the program code in practice.

Color LinesView:AnApproach toVisualization of Families of Function Graphs
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Data sets often include information that can be represented as a mapping that describes how a dependent variable depends on an independent variable. Such a mapping, usually represented as a function graph, can be parameterized to provide a family of function graphs. The challenge is how to efficiently aggregate individual function graph views to represent the whole family and allow visual analysis and search for patterns. We propose a novel view, called the color lines view, which provides a two dimensional, rectangular view where each line represents a single function graph. The points on the line correspond to values of the independent variable. The point colors represent the value of the dependent variable. The lines, placed next to each other in parallel, show a family of function graphs. The color lines view offers sorting and brushing features which support visual analysis procedures that are difficult to perform with previously existing views.

Spreadsheet-based Framework for Interactive 3D Visualization of Web Resources
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
We propose a spreadsheet-based visualization framework for end-users to generate and modify multiple 3D visualizations of data-sets from various Web resources. In this paper, first, we provide a 3D component-based access mechanism to Web resources. It allows users to access various Web resources using only 3D visual components interactively. Second, we provide an interactive 3D visualization mechanism. It enables users to construct multiple 3D visualizations of data-sets from various Web resources just by combining 3D visual components. Third, we provide 2D components for communicating between a spreadsheet and 3D components. Users can export necessary functions of 3D components and define synchronization between these components and cells on a spreadsheet. A spreadsheet environment allows us to define relationships among cells, and copy these relationships through a copy and paste manipulation. By using these mechanisms, users can create multiple visualizations in parallel in order to compare different visualization results simultaneously for different visualization parameters just through a user's direct manipulation.

Focus Group Methodology for Evaluating Information Visualization Techniques and Tools
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper proposes a structured methodology that uses focus group interviews to evaluate Information Visualization techniques and tools. Focus groups are particularly suitable for the collection of qualitative data from users, and allow researchers to uncover unexpected problems that cannot be identified through analytical evaluations or controlled experiments. The approach relies on open-ended questions to explore user attitudes, feelings, and beliefs, but also indicates a number of questions designed to explore specific cognitive tasks related to Information Visualization systems. We argue that focusing the discussion on cognitive tasks allows for the generation of user comments that are more effective than informal and unstructured interviews.

A Comparative Study of Four Hierarchy Browsers using the Hierarchical Visualisation Testing Environment (HVTE)
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Four hierarchy browsers were compared in a counterbalanced repeated measures study with 32 test users. The four browsers tested were in-house implementations of 1) a Windows Explorer style tree view, 2) an information pyramids browser, 3) a treemap browser, and 4 ) a hyperbolic browser. Each user performed eight tasks with each browser. Task completion time, subjective ratings, and overall preference data were collected. Almost no significant differences in performance were found, but users significantly preferred the tree view browser. The four browsers are implemented as part of the hierarchical visualisation system (HVS), a Java framework for visualising hierarchies. The hierarchical visualisation testing environment (HVTE) is a semi-automated testing environment built on top of HVS, which presents a sequence of tasks from a test case database to the user, together with an associated browser and test hierarchy, and automates the collection of timing data.

Towards a Model of Information Aesthetics in Information Visualization
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper proposes a model of information aesthetics in the context of information visualization. It addresses the need to acknowledge a recently emerging number of visualization projects that combine information visualization techniques with principles of creative design. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of information aesthetics as a potentially independent research field within visualization that specifically focuses on the experience of aesthetics, dataset interpretation and interaction. The proposed model is based on analysing existing visualization techniques by their interpretative intent and data mapping inspiration. It reveals information aesthetics as the conceptual link between information visualization and visualization art, and includes the fields of social and ambient visualization. This model is unique in its focus on aesthetics as the artistic influence on the technical implementation and intended purpose of a visualization technique, rather than subjective aesthetic judgments of the visualization outcome. This research provides a framework for understanding aesthetics in visualization, and allows for new design guidelines and reviewing criteria.

Applying Animation to the Visual Analysis of Financial Time-Dependent Data
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization

2007
For decades, financial analysts have strived to use modern data visualization tools to improve the timeliness and quality of their analysis. As the amount of data to be processed increases rapidly and requirements on quality of financial analysis rise, the demand for analysis support systems grows. We present a system for the visual analysis of large amounts of time-dependent data using animation. For each data entity, indicators are presented in a scatter-plot framework, displaying the correlation between them. The design of the glyphs illustrates additional data dimensions. The system uses animation to handle the time-dimension of the data. It offers various features, such as focus, zoom, details on demand and time period selection to support the analysis. Financial indicators are used to demonstrate the usability of the system. The animation proves to be a powerful tool for analysing time-dependent processes in cross-sectional data sets and discovering patterns in the data.

An Information Visualization Approach to Retail Space Management (VisMT)
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Retail space management is one of the more crucial challenges faced by retailers today with an ever ever- expanding volume of data to which they must refer when making decisions. Problems have emerged that are intractable using traditional means but for which interactive information visualization shows much promise. These problems or tasks are exploratory in nature and use temporal multivariate data. Department stores must maximize and optimize return on allocated retail space. Although product sales are readily available, the missing link for most retailers is a precise understanding of each store's layout in relation to its capacity and performance. This paper introduces a novel approach Visual Space Management (VSM) demonstrated with a multiple-linked view application (VisMT) that explores retail data related to space performance. VisMT integrates familiar information visualization representations and a 3D interactive layout of store floor plans with retail data sources. Parallel coordinates plot serves as a multivariate visual control panel in the coordinated system. Seasonally retail data analysis is performed simultaneously in linked views through time. Visual inquiry methods are supported for conditioned temporal multivariate data.

Real-time Interactive Visualization of Information Hierarchies
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
An information hierarchy is a collection of relational information that is arranged in a ranking organization where each entity is subject to a single other entity, except for the top (root) element. The usefulness of a visualization of an information hierarchy depends on its capability of conveying the information quickly and clearly. The interaction with the information hierarchy allows a user to further analyze its underlying structures and relationships, which is essential for the effectiveness of the visualization. In this paper we present a novel method to interactively visualize information hierarchies in real-time. We use the World Wide Web as an application example of our techniques. The result is a novel Web browsing and visualization method with an innovative combination of features: (i) Web data is retrieved and displayed in real-time (i.e. Web data is not pre-recorded), (ii) browsing and visualization are synchronized together in the same interface, (iii) tree-based visualization engine, and (iv) space-efficient display of visualization. Our study shows that users are able to orient themselves better in cyberspace and locate Web pages of interest faster.

2007
The ability to identify and examine patterns of activities is a key tool for social and behavioural science. In the past this has been done by statistical or purely visual methods but automated sequential pattern analysis through sophisticated data mining and visualization tools for pattern location and evaluation can open up new possibilities for interactive exploration of the data. This paper describes the addition of a sequential pattern identification method to the visual activity-analysis tool, VISUAL-TimePAcTS, and its effectiveness in the process of pattern analysis in social science diary data. The results have shown that the method correctly identifies patterns and conveys them effectively to the social scientist in a manner that allows them quick and easy understanding of the significance of the patterns.

Dynamic Text Filtering for Improving the Usability of Alphasliders on Small Screens
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Previous research has shown that alphasliders are an effective tool for searching an alphabetically sorted list when only limited screen space is available for the graphical user interface. To improve user satisfaction, we propose equipping the widget with a novel text filter to dynamically limit the slider range. In this way, users are supported in locating target items and in identifying records that are missing. The results of a comparative user evaluation run on a personal digital assistant showed that 8 out of 12 participants preferred the filter widget to the classic interface. We further suggest an enhanced alphaslider design to speed up user interaction.

Patents are an invaluable source of scientific and technological information. Due to the strongly increasing number of patent applications and the broadening of the objectives of patent analysis, there is a great demand for ubiquitous access to patent information and for flexible visualizations meeting the requirements of different groups of users. In this paper we propose new visualization techniques for patent information and approaches for interactively exploring this information in web based environments. We show how these visualizations can be integrated into existing web portals by using a new paradigm that we call Semantic Lens.

The paper presents a prototype that implements multiple coordinated views to information visualization in augmented reality environments. Augmented reality provides more intuitive and easy interaction. It also reduces the limitations of visualization and enhances the collaborative aspect. A modified version of ARToolKit has been used to create the augmented environment, and the 3D scatter plot technique has been developed to represent the multiple views of data. The coordination between views supported dynamic queries, data selection, and the configuration of views and of the detail on demand feature. This paper also reproduces literature usability tests based on tasks in order to analyze the viability to implement multiple coordinated views in augmented environments for information visualization.

This paper reports on continuing work on visualising email collaboration (O.A. Puade and T.G. Wyeld, 2006). It reports on the re- interviewing of participants of a previous email collaboration visualisation study regarding the identification of key players. Participants were asked to comment on the finding of key player impact on the collaboration as determined by our analysis and methods. We found, while they mostly agreed with our analysis they expressed reservations regarding the methods used. This forms the ground work for yet further work in developing a real-time visualisation tool for email-mediated collaboration. The qualitative analysis case-study method used in this study helped gain a deeper understanding of the nature and characteristic of the collaboration that would otherwise have been hidden in a quantitative analysis.

Visualizing the Decision-Making Process in a Face-to-Face Meeting
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
The decision making process is usually one of the most critical elements of any face-to-face meeting. Participants in a group meeting follow certain procedures and guidelines for facilitating the decision making process. These include such rules as turn taking, not interrupting the consultation, and keeping suggestions or ideas clear and concise. The ultimate objective of such meetings is to arrive at decisions in a timely manner by having a diversity of opinions from as many participants as possible. We postulate that by visualizing the group dynamics during a face-to-face meeting, administrators might be able to get a better handle on the strengths and weaknesses of the group's consultation process. The end result would be to improve the overall quality of meetings. We present a visualization tool that captures and reveals the ongoing social dynamics during the decision-making process within a face-to-face and real-time meeting. Our system captures the required data through a simple and easy-to-use interface and then visualizes the outcome of the meeting.

2007
This paper presents a method for the real-time generation of grids from 3D line scan data for in-line scan previews and the evaluation of large point clouds derived from different 3D-scanners. By exploiting the underlying measuring principles, we generate regular grids for each scan operation even if the sensor movement is non-linear. These grids are finally used for NURBS patch approximations, which enable the determination of higher order features, e.g. curvature and quality evaluations. Experimental results at the example of different point clouds illustrate the effectiveness of our methods in practice.

2007
Time-series forecasting has a large number of applications. Users with a partial time series for auctions, new stock offerings, or industrial processes desire estimates of the future behavior. We present a data driven forecasting method and interface called similarity-based forecasting (SBF). A pattern matching search in an historical time series dataset produces a subset of curves similar to the partial time series. The forecast is displayed graphically as a river plot showing statistical information about the SBF subset. A forecasting preview interface allows users to interactively explore alternative pattern matching parameters and see multiple forecasts simultaneously. User testing with 8 users demonstrated advantages and led to improvements.

Visualisation of Parallel Data Streams with Temporal Mosaics
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Despite its popularity and widespread use, timeline visualisation suffers from shortcomings which limit its use for displaying multiple data streams when the number of streams increases to more than a handful. This paper presents the Temporal Mosaic technique for visualisation of parallel time-based streams which addresses some of these shortcomings. Temporal mosaics provide a compact way of representing parallel streams of events by allocating a fixed drawing area to time intervals and partitioning that area according to the number of concurrent events. A user study is presented which compares this technique to a standard timeline representation technique in which events are depicted as horizontal bars and multiple streams are drawn in parallel along a vertical axis. Results of this user study show that users of the temporal mosaic visualisation perform significantly better at detecting concurrency, interval overlaps and inactivity than users of standard timelines.

Visualizing Collaborative Filtering in Digital Collections
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
The NEAR (navigating exhibitions, annotations and resources) panel is a method of managing digital collections and user preferences through collaborative filtering and graphically revealing implicit data relations such as sharing, reference and similarity. It is implemented on AldrVIldrRE, an online multimedia repository. AldrVIldrRE supports semi-structured collections (exhibitions) which containing various resources and annotations. Its users are encouraged to contribute, share, annotate and interpret resources. Similar to the act of adding items into shopping carts in the e-commence applications, a user's activities of searching, organizing and interpreting data in AldrVIldrRE are considered as evidence of user's preferences. The design process of NEAR was guided by several principles from the visualization literature. It implements new navigation and communication approaches that support discovery of relations. Having tested NEAR with several users, we further analyze the design, report the evaluation and consider its use in other applications.

WET: a prototype of an Exploratory Search System for Web Mining to assess Usability
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Analysing the evolution of a site and the behaviour of its users has become a crucial work in order to let the Webmasters and the owners of web sites to enhance their site in terms of structure and contents. Data mining techniques provide many metrics and statistics useful to understand the structure of a website, and the use its users make of it, but they are still not easy to interpret and to understand. Most of these metrics can also be combined, in order to discover new trends and patterns. We present a preliminary prototype of an exploratory search system for web mining which main goal is to provide a set of tools and visual representations that allow the user to explore and to decide how to represent the available data. This approach defines a system that will help us to evaluate the usability of the implemented interactions and visual metaphors.

Visual Mashup of Text and Media Search Results
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
There is a growing trend of enabling users to view diverse sources of data in an integrated manner, called visual mashups. This paper addresses the problem of how to visualize diverse data sources in a single integrated display when geographical meta-data is not available or advisable to use to combine the data sources. A visual mashup of web, image, video, news, blog and tagging search results is introduced. The presented solution makes it possible to visualize relationships between the different data sources, which would be difficult to show in a series of mini-displays arranged in a grid layout.

Semantic Map Based Web Search Result Visualization
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
The problem of information overload has become more pressing with the emergence of the increasingly more popular Internet services. The main information retrieval mechanisms provided by the prevailing Internet Web software are based on either keyword search (e.g., Google and Yahoo) or hypertext browsing (e.g., Internet Explorer and Netscape). The research presented in this paper is aimed at providing an alternative concept-based categorization and search capability based on a combination of meta-search and self-organizing maps. Kohonen's self-organizing map is very well known as a clustering and dimension reduction tool. Clustering can be used for categorization of search results. Dimension reduction can be used for visualization and for reducing information in order to ease search.

Mapping a Local Web Domain
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
In this study, we crawled a local Web domain, created its graph representation, and analyzed the network structure. The results of network analysis revealed local scale-free patterns consistent with previous research on the Web. To discover topical communities of the local domain, link- based co-citation analysis was performed to measure pair-wise similarities. Based on the co-citation graph, a visualization was produced to map the networked domain semantically. All of this offers a way to investigate a local Web structure and to make it more intuitively understandable.

Visualizing Web Navigation Data with Polygon Graphs
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
As the volume of digitally accessible information grows, there is increasing pressure on the development of data visualization methods to enable humans to interpret that data. We provide a description of our WebViz system, as a tool to visualize both the structure and usage of web sites. We illustrate the use of our visualization paradigm by introducing polygonal graphs layered on top of our adaptation of radial disk trees. In our system, the structure of a web segment is rendered as a radial tree, and usage data can be extracted and layered as polygonal graphs. By interactively creating and adjusting these layers, a user can develop real time insight into the data. We present the system, show the idea of interactive visual operators, and provide some examples that help show the value of the specific visualization techniques, as well as the interactive use of those techniques.

Visualizing Evolving Searches with EvoBerry
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Studies show that roughly one-third of searches that are performed on the Web require the user to initiate subsequent searches. Bates theorized that with every search the user will encounter new information, which in turn leads to new ideas and directions. This process causes a change, not simply in the query terms being used but also to the nature of the information retrieval task itself; Bates called this the evolving search. She also noted that evolving searches utilize many different information sources, generate substantial quantities of data and require easy methods to save and recall data. Although current search tools are exceptionally efficient at locating highly ranked pages, the tools do not encourage or support the user in an evolving search. In this paper we present techniques that aid users to find, view and manage data produced from their evolving searches. In particular, we introduce the EvoBerry environment, which we have developed for use with evolving searches. EvoBerry includes methods to visualize additional search result information (such as length of page or file type), manage the user's session and browsing history, compare result sets, and store and bookmark items for future reference.

Graph Use to Visualize Web Search Results: MyWish 3.0
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This work suggests a search tool, MyWISH 3.0, as a solution for common web search results visualization limits. This tool unifies performance standards of a stable tool with the advanced visualization ability of a Java-based, highly configurable component. The data flow of these two modules ends up in an XML interface. Moreover, because of its accurate caching techniques and its set-limited activities tracking, the tool aims to be used by communities sharing the same research objectives, making them manage various contents in a easier way. The paper starts with an overview about literature concerning visualization tools, trying to highlight present features and to suggest the deployment of some aspects. Then, it presents a test-case verified and validated implementation within a web search limited background, like a scientific community looking for information concerning European funding.

The Hierarchical Visualisation System (HVS)
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Numerous techniques have been developed for visualising hierarchically structured information. This paper presents a new framework for the visualisation of hierarchies called the hierarchical visualisation system (HVS). HVS is a general framework implemented in Java. It provides a synchronised, multiple view environment for visualising, exploring and managing large hierarchies. HVS reads hierarchies either from the file system or from TreeML files. Eleven hierarchy browsers have so far been implemented within HVS, including: traditional tree views, the classic Walker tree layout, information pyramids, treemaps, a hyperbolic browser, sunburst, and cone trees. In addition to being a tool to explore and manage hierarchies, HVS was also designed to provide a platform for the empirical evaluation and comparison of different hierarchy browsers. The hierarchical visualisation testing environment (HVTE) is a semi-automated testing environment built on top of HVS. HVTE is being used for a series of comparative studies of hierarchy browsers.

Geographic Routing on Improved Coordinates
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
We consider routing methods for networks when geographic positions of nodes are available. Instead of using the original geographic coordinates, however, we precompute virtual coordinates using a barycentric layout. Combined with simple geometric routing rules, this greatly reduces the lengths of routes and outperforms algorithms working on the original coordinates. Along with experimental results we proof properties such as guaranteed message delivery and worst-case optimality. Our methods apply to static networks in which short routes are important, but memory for full routing tables is not available and the one-time-precomputation is affordable.

Navani: Navigating Large-Scale Visualisations with Animated Transitions
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
When visualising datasets that are too large to be displayed in their entirity, interactive navigation is a common solution. However, instantaneous updates of the visualisation when navigating can result in disruption to the user's mental map. Animated transitions are one way of addressing this problem. This paper presents the data-model-view-controller (DMVC) architecture for navigation-based interactive systems. Navani, a software framework based on DMVC for supporting animated transitions during navigation, is presented, along with a sample application of it to hierarchical data.

Working with patterns in large multivariate datasets - Karnaugh-Veitch-Maps revisited
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
We present an interactive visualization method for the multivariate analysis of large and complex datasets, based on the layout of Karnaugh-Veitch-diagrams. Working on data categories, we additionally provide an interactive partitioning of value ranges of ordinal types. Multivariate dependencies manifest on the map in characteristic color patterns. These patterns are representations of subsets of the data or attributes which embody significant information. While the task of the user is to identify visual patterns of particular interest to him by clicking on the map, the software identifies a minimal representation of the corresponding subset and gives a visual feedback. Hence, user and machine cooperate on the basis of a strong visual coupling in short iterative cycles. During this process the trade-off between the accuracy and simplicity of a representation, which is crucial for any type of the building of analytical models, can be found in an effective way.

Targeted Projection Pursuit for Interactive Exploration of High- Dimensional Data Sets
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
High-dimensional data is, by its nature, difficult to visualise. Many current techniques involve reducing the dimensionality of the data, which results in a loss of information. Targeted Projection Pursuit is a novel method for visualising high-dimensional datasets which allows the user to interactively explore the space of possible views to find those that meet their requirements. A prototype tool that utilises this method is introduced, and is shown to allow users to explore data through an interface that is transparent and efficient. The tool and underlying technique are general purpose - applicable to any high-dimensional numeric data, and supporting a wide range of exploratory data analysis activities - but are evaluated on three particular tasks using gene expression data: identifying discriminatory genes, visualising diagnostic classes, and detecting misdiagnosed samples. It is found to perform well in comparison with standard techniques.

A Data Forest: Multi-Dimensional Visualization
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
As terabyte datasets become the norm, the focus has shifted away from our ability to produce and store ever larger amounts of data, onto its utilization. It is becoming increasingly difficult to gain meaningful insights into the data produced. Also many forms of the data we are currently producing cannot easily fit into traditional visualization methods. This paper presents a new and novel visualization technique based on the concept of a data forest. Our data forest has been designed to be used with virtual reality (VR) as its presentation method. VR is a natural medium for investigating large datasets. Our approach can easily be adapted to be used in a variety of different ways, from a stand alone single user environment to large multi-user collaborative environments. A test application is presented using multi-dimensional data to demonstrate the concepts involved.

Aesthetic Primitives of Images for Visualization
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Images play an important role in visualization. As users are more willing to adopt a product if it evokes pleasurable feelings the aesthetic appeal of interfaces becomes more important. Thus, there is a growing need to generate also images which appear aesthetically to the user. Starting with the modularities of the human visual system, we derive six dimensions of visual aesthetics. For each dimension we explore, inspired by principles of the visual arts and insights of cognitive neuroscience, which pecularities of the dimensions are particularly adequate for an aesthetic impression. Accompanied by a fair number of image examples, these considerations result in an easy to understand guideline for computer scientists and interface designers how to deal with images in terms of aesthetics.

Viewing the Larger Context of Genomic Data through Horizontal Integration
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Genomics is an important emerging scientific field that relies on meaningful data visualization as a key step in analysis. Specifically, most investigation of gene expression microarray data is performed using visualization techniques. However, as microarrays become more ubiquitous, researchers must analyze their own data within the context of previously published work in order to gain a more complete understanding. No current method for microarray visualization and analysis enables biology researchers to observe the greater context of data that surrounds their own results, which severely limits the ability of researchers draw novel conclusions. Here we present a system, called HIDRA, that visually integrates the simultaneous display of multiple microarray datasets to identify important parallels and dissimilarities. We demonstrate the power of our approach through examples of real-world biological insights that can be observed using HIDRA that are not apparent using other techniques.

An Empirical Classification of Visual Methods for Management: Results of Picture Sorting Experiments with Managers and Students
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper presents an empirically derived taxonomy of managerial visualization methods by reporting on the results of picture sorting experiments with a total of 65 participants (37 students and 15 experienced and 13 young managers). Participants were asked to group 30 thumb nailed images of visualization- based methods based on their spontaneous judgments of similarity. By conducting an average cluster analysis on the resulting similarity matrix (based on a pair-wise analysis of group co-membership), an overall classification system emerged from the participants' groupings that revealed salient classification attributes as well as insights into the grouping rationale of students and (junior and senior) managers. As a main result, we present a dendrogram of thirty visual methods and its limitations due to biases in the perception of the participants, diagram novelty, and due to ambiguous conventions employed in some diagrams. In addition, we present a list of salient grouping attributes used by the participants. These attributes, as well as the derived guidelines, can be used for future classification systems in the area of managerial visualization methods.

This paper is designed to examine whether metaphor, meaning and perception are sufficiently dealt with in knowledge visualization. This culminates in the following hypothesis: because knowledge visualization is a process of construction and reconstruction, the only reasonable approach to evaluate its mechanisms and effectiveness has to be deconstructivist. Such an approach is introduced and examined, leading to primary conclusions and an outlook on a theoretical foundation of an upcoming 'scientific discipline'.

Investigating perceptual responses and shared understanding of architectural design ideas when communicated through different forms of visual representations
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Research to date has demonstrated the apparent differences how architects, as 'experts' and members of the public as 'non-experts' perceive and understand visual representations. However, the studies that compare architect' responses with other professionals in the field are rare. This paper reports the findings from an Economic and Social science Research Council (ESRC) funded study that investigated peoples' perceptual and cognitive responses to traditional and computer generated forms of architectural representations. The study and analysis provide an insight into factors that are relevant to the communication, shared understanding of design ideas and knowledge exchange amongst the participants in the process. Findings indicate strong resemblance between professionals' and 'lay' peoples' responses. Architects' responses vary depending on the age and length of work experience. The analysis of groups' accounts of how and why they prefer and value the forms they do shows the fracturing of communication and shared understanding amongst participants.

Text Visualization - What Colors Tell About a Text
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This article introduces an approach to text visualization by colors. I suggest a color code that displays word classes: noun (black), verb (red), adjective (green), determiner (grey), particle (brown), conjunction (blue), and interjection (yellow). The colored words provide some details about 1. text genre, 2. sentence structure, and 3. writing style. Samples with fictional narratives and scientific articles (both in German) show that fictional texts have a brighter color pattern compared to scientific texts. The color pattern might be related to the hidden sound or melody of a text. Therefore, text visualization could be useful both as a future method to analyze different text genres and as a method helping laypersons getting a better feeling for texts, identifying troublesome phrases, and perhaps improving their writing style.

The domain of astronomy contributes a wealth of knowledge to the corpus of any general encyclopedia. Modern multimedia encyclopedias are capable of displaying complex, three-dimensional visualizations in real-time, enabling the integration of a planetarium, a virtual theater presenting astronomical facts in an educational and entertaining way. The manifold peculiarities of astronomical data sets require careful balancing of visual means to create representations comprehensible for a general audience. In this paper we discuss design and implementation considerations for a planetarium integrated with the prevalent German language multimedia encyclopedia.

Fused Exploration of Temporal Developments and Topical Relationships in Heterogeneous Data Sets
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
In many application areas which deal with heterogeneous data sets temporal developments and topical relationships both play an important role. A number of visual representations have been developed which separately address each of these two aspects of the data. However, a simultaneous analysis of both aspects is also often required. In this paper we introduce an approach which utilizes a combination of visual representations, where some are targeting the temporal behaviour while others are focusing on topical relationships. The views are fused in the sense that they are tightly coupled with respect to the visualised data set, considered time interval, and user actions. The resulting user interface enables the user to simultaneously explore and discover patterns in both temporal and topical aspects of a heterogeneous data set. As a proof of concept a demo application was developed and applied for visualising temporal and topical patterns extracted from meeting recordings.

Visualization of huge data sets for activities in business worlds, entertainment industries and extended visualization in sciences are one of the most exciting chances in architecture. They can result in interweaving physical spaces - physical architectures - with electronic data spaces - virtual architectures. Places and localities with distances in geographical, intercultural and economic matters do not need to exist separated any longer. The networking concepts shout for the use of new architectural languages. Architectural interfaces in physical and digital spaces deliver associated communication, collaboration and learning - breaking up distances in time and geographic spaces. Inside this paper we will discuss how information architecture could be set up in existing buildings with the Value Lab as an example and which methods can be used to develop and to design physical architecture. We present the Value Lab as a recent prototype for Information Architecture.

2007
Research on the interplay of cognition and effect in the interpretation of visuals has made significant theoretical advances. This literature review highlights three themes which have emerged in advertising research. First it looks at the determinants constituting and influencing 'likeability'- the best predictor of advertisement effectiveness. Second it presents evidence how emotional advertising frames and shapes perception and how it could influence persuasion. Finally it discusses the role of 'co-authoring' in the interpretation of visuals and how it does affect persuasion over the emotional route.

Place-Hampi is an embodied theatre of participation in the drama of Hindu mythology focused at the most significant archaeological, historical and sacred locations of the World Heritage site Vijayanagara (Hampi), South India. The research described in this paper examines a history of several scopic regimes observable in Indian aesthetic traditions (principally those associated with chromolithography) and their socio-cultural implications-to articulate the somatic engagement inherent to encounters with the mythological deities in image form. Information derived from the examination of diverse scopic regimes has been used to guide the decisions in symbolic logic and high level cognitive programming of computer graphic characters that help co-evolve the narrative engagement between intangible heritage of 'place' and participants.

Visualizing endangered indigenous languages of French Polynesia with LEXUS
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper reports on the first results of the DOBES project 'Towards a multimedia dictionary of the Marquesan and Tuamotuan languages of French Polynesia'. Within the framework of this project we are building a digital multimedia encyclopedic lexicon of the endangered Marquesan and Tuamotuan languages using a new tool, LEXUS. LEXUS is a Web-based lexicon tool, targeted at linguists involved in language documentation. LEXUS offers the possibility to visualize language. It provides functionalities to include audio, video and still images to the lexical entries of the dictionary, as well as relational linking for the creation of a semantic network knowledge base. Further activities aim at the development of (1) an improved user interface in close cooperation with the speech community and (2) a collaborative workspace functionality which will allow the speech community to actively participate in the creation of lexica.

The Dynamic Organization of Space and Place
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization

2007
The rigid rectilinear forms of contemporary architectural design neither resemble nor relate the space surrounding us as an extension of the self whether physical or mental. By "extending" or "projecting" space and form outward from the body and its movements, a new paradigm can be applied to the structure of place as it relates to the extended space of the human self. The following project proposes a method, using motion capture technology, for the design and organization of environments that are harmonious with the human self. The synergistic flow among individuals, and between the individual and his or her environment, is promoted by the organization of space around the principle of the motion of the human body. This extension of the body's form into space is informed by the natural features of an existent site. The synergistically activated space is thus reinterpreted in relation to factors produced by natural forces.

Research Mining using the Relationships among Authors, Topics and Papers
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
As information technology progress, we are able to obtain much information about the advanced research of others. As a result, researchers and research managers need to track the current research trends amid the information flood. In order to support these efforts to gather knowledge of current research, we propose a research trend mining method. The method utilizes an author-topic model for establishing the relationships between authors, topics, and papers by probabilities, and interactively visualizes the relationships using self-organizing maps. We implemented a research area mapping system and validated it with a case study. In addition, we conducted experiments to show the performance of our system. The experimental results indicate that this system can induce the appropriate relationships for finding research trends.

A Non-Expert Organised Visual Database: a Case Study in Using the Amazon Metric to Search Images
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
In a previous paper the notion of "using the Amazon metric to construct an image database based on what people do, not what they say" was introduced (see [1]). In that paper we described a case study setting where 20 participants were asked to arrange a collection of 60 images from most to least similar. We found they organised them in many different ways for many different reasons. Using Wexelblat's [2] semantic dimensions as axes for visualisation in conjunction with the Amazon metric we were able to identify common clusters of images according to expert and non-expert orderings. This second study describes the construction of a visual database based on the results of the first case study's non-expert participants' organising strategies and rationales. The same participants from the first study were invited to search for 'remembered' images in the visual database. A better understanding was gained of their detailed reasonings behind their choices. This led to the development of a non-expert organised visual database that proved to be useful to the non-expert user. This paper concludes with some recommendations for future research into developing a non-expert, self- organising, visual, image database using multiple thesauri, based on these core studies.

Linguistic Interpretations of Scuba Dive Computer Data
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Exploratory visualizations of dive computer data are available to the scuba diving community to examine the safety of their recorded dives. In a study involving certified scuba divers on the usage of these visualizations we found that these are not used regularly which agrees well with the suspicions expressed by the medical staff who attend to patients with diving related illnesses. We built a prototype knowledge based system that interprets dive computer data to automatically generate their linguistic interpretations to supplement the existing visualizations. We hypothesized that linguistic interpretations by virtue of their structure communicate safety related messages directly to divers. Our evaluation showed that divers like the idea of integrating linguistic interpretations into existing visualizations. However, the study also showed that linguistic interpretations can be useful only if they are emotionally appropriate to individual divers.

Combining DagMaps and Sugiyama Layout for the Navigation of Hierarchical Data
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper presents a novel technique for exploring and navigating large hierarchies, not restricted to trees but to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The technique combines two different visualizations emphasizing different points of view the user can adopt when analyzing the content of the hierarchy. Usual hierarchical (node-link) layout reflect the relative position of nodes in the hierarchy while a variation of a treemap emphasizes node attributes. The classical treemap algorithm has been adapted in order to deal with DAGs. Linking the two views enables the user to visually and interactively explore elements of the hierarchy with respect to selected attributes, while being able to locate the node in the DAG.

This paper reports a bibliometric analysis of evolving co-author networks. Using 5,009 articles covering the years 1993 to 2005 from Transactions D. (Information Systems) of the Institute of Electronics Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE), we attempt to compare the network characteristics for each year, the co-author network characteristics for the entire time span, and the four major components of the entire data set. Finally, we analyze each of these in contrast to extant co-authorship network data and find that the pattern of co-authorship within Information Systems does not change significantly over this time period.

The visualization of a cocitation network is a useful technique for information scientists. The technique will help to illustrate the intellectual structure of a given knowledge domain. We hope our results will improve on current tools with regard to user interface interactivity and scale better for larger data sets. We developed a tool, with the visualizing cocitation network in mind, by using an open-sourced toolkit for interactive information visualization to address some of these inadequacies. This tool exhibits cocitation graphs with latent visual cues and allows direct interaction with the visualized graphs. We demonstrated the visualized effects of this tool and complemented the results with its domain content analysis in a case study.

GeoDDupe: A Novel Interface for Interactive Entity Resolution in Geospatial Data
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Due to the growing interest in geospatial data mining and analysis, data cleaning and integration in geospatial data is becoming an important issue. Geospatial entity resolution is the process of reconciling multiple location references to the same real world location within a single data source (deduplication) or across multiple data sources (integration). In this paper, we introduce an interactive tool called GeoDDupe which effectively combines automatic data mining algorithms for geospatial entity resolution with a novel network visualization supporting users' resolution analysis and decisions. We illustrate the GeoDDupe interface with an example geospatial dataset and show how users can efficiently and accurately resolve location entities. Finally, the case study with two real-world geospatial datasets demonstrates the potential of GeoDDupe.

'Tag clouds' and 'tag maps' are introduced to represent geographically referenced text. In combination, these aspatial and spatial views are used to explore a large structured spatio-temporal data set by providing overviews and filtering by text and geography. Prototypes are implemented using freely available technologies including Google Earth and Yahoo! 's Tag Map applet. The interactive tag map and tag cloud techniques and the rapid prototyping method used are informally evaluated through successes and limitations encountered. Preliminary evaluation suggests that the techniques may be useful for generating insights when visualizing large data sets containing geo-referenced text strings. The rapid prototyping approach enabled the technique to be developed and evaluated, leading to geovisualization through which a number of ideas were generated. Limitations of this approach are reflected upon. Tag placement, generalisation and prominence at different scales are issues which have come to light in this study that warrant further work.

2007
We introduce our generic "GeoAnalytics" visualization (GAV) component toolkit, based on the principles behind visual analytics (VA), for dynamically exploring time-varying, geographically referenced and multivariate attribute data. GAV includes components that supports a mixture of technologies from the three visualization fields; information visualization, geovisualization and scientific visualization. Our research concentrates on improving visual user interfaces (VUI) methods and extends existing visual representation techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate the synergy of integrating a wide range of different methods using multiple-linked views with a rich variety of possible coordination exploration ideas and allowing the user to view the information from different perspectives and try out different scenarios. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is demonstrated in a tailor-made case study assembled from GAV components and explores the supply and use of energy data for controlling the emission of carbon dioxide among 290 Swedish municipality regions during 1990-2004.

Heat Map Visualizations Allow Comparison of Multiple Clustering Results and Evaluation of Dataset Quality: Application to Microarray Data
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Since clustering algorithms are heuristic, multiple clustering algorithms applied to the same dataset will typically not generate the same sets of clusters. This is especially true for complex datasets such as those from microarray time series experiments. Two such microarray datasets describing gene expression activities from regenerating newt forelimbs at various times following limb amputation were used in this study. A cluster stability matrix, which shows the number of times two genes appear in the same cluster, was generated as a heat map. This was used to evaluate the overall variation among the clustering algorithms and to identify similar clusters. A comparison of the cluster stability matrices for two related microarray experiments with different levels of precision was shown to be an effective basis for comparing the quality of the two sets of experiments. A pairwise heat map was generated to show which pairs of clustering algorithms grouped the data into similar clusters.

Visualizing Quantitative Proteomics Datasets using Treemaps

One of the major challenges of large scale mass spectrometry based proteomics experiments is organizing and visualizing the data in such a way so that meaningful biological conclusions can be drawn from the data. Our tool, ZoomQuant, is capable of quantitating relative protein abundance between two samples in stable isotope labeled quantitative proteomics experiments. The resulting protein ratios are then annotated and categorized using the GO ontology terms. Sets of data representing different biological states can then be compared quantitatively and the results formatted for dynamic visualization. Using TreeMap, the user can visualize the quantitative differences between the biological states in a single view. The peptide or scan count and ratio for individual proteins are displayed and organized by the GO ontologies so that the user can easily see the global differences in protein expression between the two samples.

Visualization of Growth Curve Data from Phenotype Microarray Experiments

2007
Phenotype microarrays provide a technology to simultaneously survey the response of an organism to nearly 2,000 substrates, including carbon, nitrogen and potassium sources; varying pH; varying salt concentrations; and antibiotics. In order to more quickly and easily view and compare the large number of growth curves produced by phenotype microarray experiments, we have developed software to produce and display color images, each of which corresponds to a set of 96 growth curves. Using color images to represent growth curves data has proven to be a valuable way to assess experiment quality, compare replicates, facilitate comparison of the responses of different organisms, and identify significant phenotypes. The color images are linked to traditional plots of growth versus time, as well as to information about the experiment, organism, and substrate. In order to share and view information and data project-wide, all information, plots, and data are accessible using only a Web browser.

In this paper we integrate self-organizing map algorithm (SOM) with scatter plot and Radviz, extending these visualizations into the third dimension and reducing overlap. Classic visualizations are used as the two- dimensional base, combined with a self-organizing map that extends them into the third dimension, with an adjusted neighborhood function. This approach solves the problem of overlap where more than one point plots to the same space and uncovers additional information about relationships inherent in high-dimensional data sets, including distribution of points, outliers and associations. Case studies are presented on a microarray and miRNA data sets.

Genomic study is fairly novel. Typical research processes are not established yet. Many new discoveries are happening in this area all the time. Are current methods of visualizations effective? What works well? What could be improved? These are some of the questions we are interested in evaluating for two graphical tools used to compare nucleotide sequences. Scatter plots and parallel coordinate-like visuals have been used in genomics for identifying similarities in genetic code. Our preliminary evaluation focuses on determining the aspects of the two visualizations that are successful and those that need enhancements.

Virtual Vandalism: The Effect of Physical Incivilities on the Affective Appraisal of 3D Urban Models
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
3D models of an urban area were manipulated to create an impression of neglect and dilapidation. In an experimental study the affective appraisals of the original and the manipulated models were compared. Results demonstrate that unfavourable elements in an urban environment, that are usually omitted from 3D models, influence the appraisal of the participants about the area, but only slightly and less than expected. Moreover, the judgment of the environment seems to be influenced by expectations of the representation. When 3D models are used for decision making in urban planning, this effect has to be taken into account. The experiment thus demonstrates that measuring instruments should be designed in such a way that the content (the environment) can be assessed separately from the chosen representation.

2007
Urban design is generally a pre-organizing process of land usage and is traditionally regarded as a highly collaborative activity. Augmented reality (AR) technology, the addition of virtual entities into the real world view, can support design assessment and collaboration within design team. This paper presented an experimental study that investigated the capability of Augmented Reality in the field of urban design and other related design tasks which involve group design and planning processes. Two realistic urban design scenarios were used to compare the performance between two treatments: the traditional wood block (TWB) method and the AR technology (ART). The results obtained from this experiment showed that although some technical difficulties in the AR system introduced negative performance factors on the outcome, all the subjects believed that the system holds significant potentials in urban design.

The increasing commercial availability of highly accurate LiDAR scanning offers remote sensed data accurate enough for generalized and distant views of the environment. From this data, bare earth digital terrain models (DTMs) can be processed semi-automatically, then draped with aerial imagery. The paper describes an approach developed in the VEPs project that switches on the LiDAR data for trees and buildings removed from the DTM in the 3D Scene. This data can then be used to visually judge the appropriate height and form of buildings and trees. A set of web-based interactive tools have been developed to enable users to freely adjust the scale and mass of structures and vegetation to match the selected point cloud area, substantially improving the quality of presence and accuracy of the resulting model. Issues are raised in obtaining equally accurate data of what is proposed from Planners and Developers.

Real-Time Data and Analysis of the Use of Office Space
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization

2007
Ambient Intelligent Systems have been proposed for their potential to track collaborative activities in the workplace, capture them, and in real time respond to them. The longer term goal is to develop embedded technologies that provide intelligent feedback in predictable office environments but also address the unpredictable working environments of nomadic knowledge workers and of remote workers engaged in virtual collaboration with those physically present. Some of these systems are relatively close to market and others are less immediately applicable. This paper suggests that a heterogeneous mix of such systems is likely to be necessary for some time to come. A prototype real time location system for mapping the real-time location of workers in offices has been developed by Johnson Controls. During tests it has been found to positively assist in gathering information for better management of space and support of collaborative activity. This has proved to justify the costs.

Specifying Augmented Virtuality Systems for Creative Architectural Design
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization

2007
Despite active research in Virtual and Augmented Reality, the emerging new technology of Augmented Virtuality (AV) has rarely been explored in the architecture arena. Augmented Virtuality, where a predominantly virtual environment is enhanced by the addition of real entities, provides a means to merge richly layered, multi-modal, 3D real context and experience acquired from the real world into virtual architectural designs. There are no noted investigations on principles of implementing AV concept in the context of architectural design with the purpose of maximizing its full potentials. This paper discusses issues and approaches in establishing scientific principles for applying AV technology in supporting architectural design comprehension. As an initial effort towards those issues, the paper also formulates a comprehensive taxonomy for specifying A V technology for architectural applications.

Multi-visualization of the Cooperative Context in Building Construction Activity A Model-Based Approach to design AEC-specific Visualization Interfaces
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Cooperation between actors in design and construction activities in architecture is an essential stake nowadays. In professional practices the actors involved in construction projects use numerous tools. The project is unique but the "views" that actors manipulate are various and sometimes fundamentally different. Their common characteristic is that they partially represent the cooperation context through a "business specific" point of view. Bat'iViews suggests to the actors a multi-view interface of the context and enables to navigate through the different views. This proposition is based on a model-driven approach. We distinguish between "context modelling" and modelling of concepts represented in each "business-view". A model integrative infrastructure allows us to develop the prototype and to manage user interaction through the definition of models' transformations.

Rethinking Practise

2007
Many architects rely upon a sense of common practise and a routine reworking of the same set of slowly evolving icons married to site, programme and available technology to generate design solutions. The paper discusses an experimental, computer-assisted approach to architectural design and assesses its applicability to mainstream architectural practise. The process illustrated deals with the observation of latent, place-specific phenomena and their effects, and the reconfiguring of these through their transposition to other mediums, into underpinning rationales for architecture. We highlight the experimental use of digital technologies to reveal elaborate matrixes of hidden relationships present in the mundane and unremarkable, and discuss the fostering of unexpected non-linear connections between these, to produce design proposals defined by the subliminal effect relationships observed. The paper conjectures upon the further development of this approach in relation to current software capability and interoperability, and we consider the implications for its wider adoption by the architectural profession as a design tool and its potential impact upon traditional modes of working practise.

Revisiting the Open Plan: Ceilings and Furniture as Display Surfaces for Building Information
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
First developed by the architectural avante-garde in the early 20th century, the idea of the open plan was the result of a desire for greater transparency and flexibility in the design of interior environments. Essential to the functioning of the open plan in these early projects is the subtle articulation of differences between one part of the open interior and another. Later co-opted as an efficient means of achieving maximum density in office environments, the open plan as commonly practiced in the latter half of the 20th century resulted in undifferentiated, homogeneous settings that failed to realize the original intentions of this architectural idea. Embedded information technology offers an opportunity to support the differentiation and legibility of the open plan by sensing and displaying aspects of the building's environmental conditions and patterns of use. We introduce two ongoing projects as examples of building interfaces that enhance the transparency of information in the building, using surfaces embedded in the building to reveal invisible attributes of the interior that can be used by inhabitants to better understand their environment.

A Real-time Dynamic Simulation Scheme for Large-Scale Flood Hazard Using 3D Real World Data
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization

2007
We propose a new dynamic simulation scheme for large-scale flood hazard modelling and prevention. The approach consists of a number of core parts: digital terrain modelling with GIS data, Nona-tree space partitions (NTSP), automatic river object recognition and registration, and a flood spreading model. The digital terrain modelling method allows the creation of a geometric real terrain model for augmented 3D environments with very large GIS data, and it can also use information gathered from aviation and satellite images with a ROAM algorithm. A spatial image segmentation scheme is described for river and flood identification and for a 3D terrain map of flooding region growth and visualisation. The region merging is then implemented by adopting flood region spreading algorithm (FRSA). Compared with the conventional methods, our approach has the advantages of being capable of realistically visualising the flooding in geometrically-real 3D environments, of handling dynamic flood behaviour in real-time and of dealing with very large-scale data modelling and visualisation.

X3D (eXtensible 3 Dimensions), the international standard for Web 3D, offers opportunities for the dynamic display and interoperability of data over the World Wide Web. One potential application relates to the process of urban planning in which applications are required to be made readily available for public comment. Relevant information is typically presented in the form of site plans and a limited number of architectural drawings that can be difficult for the general public to fully comprehend. Web3D models of proposals in the context of the site and viewed from different directions have the potential to provide the general public and the planning authority with a better understanding of the visual impact of the proposals. This paper, through a case study of a proposed residential development, demonstrates the use of standard Web browser as a GUI (graphical user interface) to control the display of a 3D model. The interactive, client side, visualization is achieved using AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML).

Exemplifying the Inter-Disciplinary Nature of Visualization Research
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization

2007
This paper proposes an interdisciplinary design process for the development of novel visualization techniques and discusses requirements for ensuring that such a process results in effective techniques which meet the demands of a the target user base. In essence, we are attempting to make explicit the process by which many researchers implicitly design visualizations and urge for greater explicit collaborations between fields to improve the effectiveness of visualization design. This process is dependent on the application of cognitive psychology, art and architecture, domain experts, and target users. We discuss how such a wide and disparate group must work together in an integrated fashion within the design process. We lay out the process itself as well as typical design goals. Given the importance of perception, we highlight the impact of perception, and thus cognitive psychology, on the visual interpretation process.

Visualization Criticism - The Missing Link Between Information Visualization and Art
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Classifications of visualization are often based on technical criteria, and leave out artistic ways of visualizing information. Understanding the differences between information visualization and other forms of visual communication provides important insights into the way the field works, though, and also shows the path to new approaches. We propose a classification of several types of information visualization based on aesthetic criteria. The notions of artistic and pragmatic visualization are introduced, and their properties discussed. Finally, the idea of visualization criticism is proposed, and its rules are laid out. Visualization criticism bridges the gap between design, art, and technical/pragmatic information visualization. It guides the view away from implementation details and single mouse clicks to the meaning of a visualization.

The Effect of Aesthetic on the Usability of Data Visualization
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Aesthetic seems currently under represented in most current data visualization evaluation methodologies. This paper investigates the results of an online survey of 285 participants, measuring both perceived aesthetic as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of retrieval tasks across a set of 11 different data visualization techniques. The data visualizations represent an identical hierarchical dataset, which has been normalized in terms of color, typography and layout balance. This study measured parameters such as speed of completion, accuracy rate, task abandonment and latency of erroneous response. Our findings demonstrate a correlation between latency in task abandonment and erroneous response time in relation to visualization's perceived aesthetic. These results support the need for an increased recognition for aesthetic in the typical evaluation process of data visualization techniques.

2007
Discovering web navigational trends and understanding data mining results is undeniably advantageous to web designers and web-based application builders. It is also desirable to interactively investigate web access data and patterns, to allows ad-hoc discovery and examination of patterns that are not apriori known. Visualizing the usage data in the context of the web site structure is of major importance, as it puts web access requests and their connectivity in perspective. Various visualization tools have been developed for this task, but often fail to provide visual data mining functionalities to generate new patterns. Here we present our visual data mining system, WebViz, which allows interactive investigation of web usage data within their structure context, as well as ad-hoc knowledge pattern discovery on web navigational behaviour.

A scalable association rule visualization towards displaying large amounts of knowledge
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Providing efficient and easy-to-use graphical tools to users is a promising challenge of data mining (DM). These tools must be able to generate explicit knowledge and to restitute it. Visualization techniques have shown to be an efficient solution to achieve such goal. Even though considered as a key step in the mining process, the visualization step of association rules received much less attention than that paid to the extraction one. Nevertheless, some graphical tools have been developed to extract and visualize association rules. In those tools, various approaches are proposed to filter the huge number of association rules before the visualization step. However both DM steps (association rule extraction and visualization) are treated separately in a one way process. Our approach differs, and uses meta-knowledge to guide the user during the mining process. Standing at the crossroads of DM and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), we present an integrated framework covering both steps of the DM process. Furthermore, our approach can easily integrate previous techniques of association rule visualization.

It is not easy to gain information on terrorist networks. It is a fact that terrorist organizations do not provide information on their members and the government rarely allows researchers to use their intelligence data [1]. Very few researchers [2] [3] [4] collected data from open sources, and to the best of our knowledge, no knowledge base is available in academia for the analysis of the terrorist events. To counter the information scarcity, we at Software Intelligence Security Research Center, Aalborg University Esbjerg Denmark, designed and developed a terrorism knowledge base by harvesting information from authenticated websites. In this paper we discuss data collection and analysis results of our ongoing research of investigative data mining (IDM). In addition, we present a system architecture of our analyzing, visualizing and destabilizing terrorist networks prototype, i.e., iMiner, and also describe how we collected terrorist information using an information harvesting system.

Visual Mining of Multi-Modal Social Networks at Different Abstraction Levels
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Social networks continue to become more and more feature rich. Using local and global structural properties and descriptive attributes are necessary for more sophisticated social network analysis and support for visual mining tasks. While a number of visualization tools for social network applications have been developed, most of them are limited to uni-modal graph representations. Some of the tools support a wide range of visualization options, including interactive views. Others have better support for calculating structural graph properties such as the density of the graph or deploying traditional statistical social network analysis. We present Invenio, a new tool for visual mining of socials. Invenio integrates a wide range of interactive visualization options from Prefuse, with graph mining algorithm support from JUNG. While the integration expands the breadth of functionality within the core engine of the tool, our goal is to interactively explore multi-modal, multi-relational social networks. Invenio also supports construction of views using both database operations and basic graph mining operations.

Navigating Large Clustered Graphs with Triple-Layer Display
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper presents a technique for navigating large clustered graphs with triple-layer display. Although our navigation and interaction technique can be applied independently to any graph layout algorithms, in our implementation, our navigation algorithm is cooperated with a clustered graph layout algorithm. In short, we provide users with the display of three levels of contextual information for navigation. They are the display of full-context, the display of the current-context view and the display of the focused view. Our technique not only allows users to navigate hierarchically up and down through the entire clustered graph, but also provides a way to navigate multiple clusters concurrently. We also use animation to preserve the users' mental maps during the interaction.

2007
The evaluation of Information Visualization (InfoVis) techniques can help to identify specific strengths and weaknesses of these methods. The following article describes the results of an empirical study assessing the contribution of an interactive InfoVis method based on a spring metaphor (GRAVI), exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) to ease understanding. The application domain is the psychotherapeutic treatment of anorectic young women. The three methods are supposed to support the therapists in finding the variables which influence success or failure of the therapy. To conduct the evaluation we developed a report system which helped subjects to formulate and document in a self-directed manner the insights they gained when using the three methods. The results indicate that the three methods are complementary and should be used in conjunction.

A Characterisation Model for Visual Interaction Interfaces
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper focuses on enhancing the effectiveness of information visualisation approaches through the use of visual interaction interfaces (VIIs). We define VIIs as being graphical components which help users understand and interact with visual representations of a target environment (or data space). These types of components have been effectively used in computer-based games to enhance user experience. However, few such techniques are used in visualisation approaches designed to support decision-makers in real-world domains. A characterisation model, based on the capture and analysis of some 200 VIIs, has been developed to help describe and understand these types of visualisation components and hence support the transitioning of these techniques into future visualisation systems.

Building for Users not for Experts: Designing a Visualization of the Literature Domain
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
As researchers we are constantly working with academic literature. Literature data is growing exponentially. Interacting with this huge amount of information has been a challenge for the field of HCI for years. The goal is to assist users in making sense of this information by producing usable designs. Information Visualization (InfoVis) augments users' cognition when interacting with complex data structures. Although the use of InfoVis as a tool for representing literature data is not new, we have found that most of the existing Literature Knowledge Domain Visualizations (LKDViz) target specialists known as domain analysts who study publication patterns. Our goal is to design a LKDViz tool for academic users. Due to the diversity of academic literature users we captured their experiences and used it as the main source for our design. Interestingly, this method generated design criteria that have not been applied in most of the academic literature visualizations.

Haptic Gaze-Tracking Based Perception of Graphical User Interfaces
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
This paper presents a novel human-computer interface that enables the computer display to be perceived without any use of the eyes. Our system works by tracking the user's head position and orientation to obtain their 'gaze' point on a virtual screen, and by indicating to the user what object is present at the gaze location via haptic feedback to the fingers and synthetic speech or Braille text. This is achieved by using the haptic vibration frequency delivered to the fingers to indicate the type of screen object at the gaze position, and the vibration amplitude to indicate the screen object's window-layer, when the object is contained in overlapping windows. Also, objects that are gazed at momentarily have their name output to the user via a Braille display or synthetic speech. Our experiments have shown that by browsing over the screen and receiving haptic and voice (or Braille) feedback in this manner, the user is able to acquire a mental two-dimensional representation of the virtual screen and its content without any use of the eyes. This form of blind screen perception can then be used to locate screen objects and controls and manipulate them with the mouse or via gaze control. Our experimental results are provided in which we demonstrate how this form of blind screen perception can effectively be used to exercise point-and-click and drag-and-drop control of desktop objects and open windows by using the mouse, or the user's head pose, without any use of the eyes.

In this paper we describe an adaptable multi-purpose 3D user interface for complex heterogeneous information. The framework allows to create visualization instruments by hierarchically combining small visualization widgets. We integrate well known 3D visualization tools in our system and also present new metaphors like the RotaryDiagram. Due to the modular architecture and the underlying ontology we are able to build intuitive visualizations that allow direct manipulation, that directly and vividly respond to user actions and adopt to changing needs. The visualizations provide the user with multiple perspectives on the data and semantic relations between items of various perspectives. The effectiveness of our proposed concepts for 3D information visualization systems is being proven by applying them to an user interface for monitoring, controlling, and optimization of a complex wastewater treatment plant.

The task of exploring and analysing large quantities of communication network security data is difficult. Visualisation of the data should help the analyses and make data exploration faster and easier. This paper describes prototype software that visualises the alerts effectively and provides a simple presentation. The needs analysis of this prototype is based on the suggested needs of network security analyst's tasks as seen in the literature. The prototype software incorporates various projections of the alert data in 3-dimensional displays. Filtering, drill-down and playback of alerts at variable speed are incorporated to strengthen the analysis. We integrate a false alert classifier using classification tree algorithm to classify alerts into false and true alerts. Real-time visual observation is also included. We describe some example analyses to prove the usefulness of our prototype.

CrystalDome is an inexpensive alternative to a volumetric display based on video projector technology that supports omni-directional viewing (Figure 1). It can show mapped spherical surfaces, such as globes, and scenes composed of three- dimensional objects. In the latter case, an algorithm was developed to perform hidden surface elimination in the hemisphere's reference frame. Participants can sit around the hemisphere, which is built into a low table. Sensors capture hand movements near the hemisphere for adjustment of the position, orientation and size of the objects that are projected from below onto the inside of the display.

A Practical Algorithm for Planar Straight-line Grid Drawings of General Trees with Linear Area and Arbitrary Aspect Ratio
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Trees are usually drawn using planar straight-line drawings. [2] presented an algorithm for constructing a planar straight-line grid drawing of a degree-d (general) tree with area 0(eta) and any pre-specified aspect ratio in the range [eta-alpha,eta alpha], where 0 &lt; alpha &lt; 1 is any constant, in O(etalogeta) time. Unfortunately, the algorithm of [2] is not suitable for practical use. The main problem is that the constant hidden in the "Oh " notation for area is quite large (for binary trees was 3900). In this paper, we have made several improvements to the algorithm, which make it suitable for practical use. We have also conducted an experiment on this newer version of the algorithm for randomly-generated general trees with up to 50,000 nodes. Our experiment shows that it constructs area-efficient drawings in practice, with area at most 19 times the number of nodes.

New Construction of Broardcast Graphs
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization

2007
Broadcast algorithms are are very important in parallel and distributed computing. In this paper we design new sparce graphs and present a minimum time broadcast algorithms from any vertex of these graphs. A broadcast graph on n vertices is a graph which allows any vertex to broadcast in time [log n]. A minimum broadcast graph on n vertices is a broadcast graph with the minimum number of edges over all broadcast graphs on n vertices. This minimum number of edges is denoted by B(n). Many papers have presented methods to construct broadcast graphs. Here we present a method to construct a broadcast graph on n + 1 vertices by adding a vertex to a broadcast graph on n vertices. Our general upper bound on B(n) improves the best known upper bounds for almost all odd values of n. Our broadcast algorithms are simple. Our new broadcast graphs can be combined using some of the known methods to obtain further improvements.

How to Draw ClusteredWeighted Graphs using a Multilevel Force-Directed Graph Drawing Algorithm
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Visualization of clustered graphs has been a research area since many years. In this paper, we describe a new approach that can be used in real application where graph does not contain only topological information but also extrinsic parameters (i.e. user attributes on edges and nodes). In the case of force-directed algorithm, management of attributes corresponds to take into account edge weights. We propose an extension of the GRIP algorithm in order to manage edge weights. Furthermore, by using Voronoi diagram we constrained that algorithm to draw each cluster in a non overlapping convex region. Using these two extensions we obtained an algorithm that draw clustered weighted graphs. Experimentation has been done on data coming from biology where the network is the genes- proteins interaction graph and where the attributes are gene expression values from microarray experiments.

Tree Encoding and Transitive Closure Compression
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
Tree encoding is a very useful mechanism to check ancestor-descendant relationships of the nodes in a tree structure, by which each node is associated with a pair of integers that can be used to characterize the reachability. Recently, this method is extended to directed graphs (digraph for short) G by associating each node in G with a pair sequence. However, no approach is reported to minimize such pair sequences. In this paper, we address this issue and propose an efficient algorithm that is always able to generate minimized pair sequences. The algorithm runs in O(bmiddote + bmiddotnmiddotradicb) time and O(bmiddot n), where n and e are the numbers of the nodes and edges of a DAG, respectively; and b is the DAG's width.

Evaluating the Comprehension of Euler Diagrams

2007
We describe an empirical investigation into layout criteria that can help with the comprehension of Euler diagrams. Euler diagrams are used to represent set inclusion in applications such as teaching set theory, database querying, software engineering, filing system organisation and bio-informatics. Research in automatically laying out Euler diagrams for use with these applications is at an early stage, and our work attempts to aid this research by informing layout designers about the importance of various Euler diagram aesthetic criteria. The three criteria under investigation were: contour jaggedness, zone area inequality and edge closeness. Subjects were asked to interpret diagrams with different combinations of levels for each of the criteria. Results for this investigation indicate that, within the parameters of the study, all three criteria are important for understanding Euler diagrams and we have a preliminary indication of the ordering of their importance.

Virtual Object Manipulation Using Physical Blocks
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization

2007
In this paper, we present a virtual object manipulation tool that can directly control virtual objects using physical objects. Physical objects can be recognized by vision based sensing. Basic manipulations using physical objects are translating, rotating, scaling and replacing with a virtual object. Those manipulations are performed by handling an object, a block. In addition to this, complicated manipulations can be realized by handling two objects with both hands. We have implemented a prototype system and assessed the effectiveness of the system by experimentally comparing it with general modeling tool. The results suggest that our object manipulation system can provide a more effective means of handling than operations in general modeling tool.

Occlusion culling for stereoscopic display of complex mechanical sets
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization

2007
This paper explores the benefits that can be achieved for stereoscopic visualization when using occlusion culling strategies. The virtual environments analysed in this paper are complex mechanical sets that are not densely occluded. Those which are built up by dense geometric sets like aerospace engines composed of thousands of components and millions of polygons. The algorithm uses occlusion queries and succeeds in improving the frame rate of the stereoscopic visualization with an effective scheduling of the queries. Different coherences, including stereo coherence, are used to achieve this effective scheduling. An aggressive approach has been also validated for inclusion in the proposal. The occlusion culling algorithm can be easily implemented and provides a significant boost in performances.

Virtual manufacturing (VM) applies virtual reality (VR) technology to provide a digital manufacturing solution in both 3D visual and interactive ways. It makes VR no longer a state-of the art but rather an innovation technology to support modern industry. With the rapid growth of network technology and Web 3D graphics techniques, we propose a cost-effective distributed VM system for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited equipment, funds and technical capabilities. The system enables SMEs to perform collaborative tasks including product design, manufacturing and resources sharing through the World Wide Web (WWW) in lower cost. This paper describes the design and critical integration issues of the system and the use of the Web 3D technology - X3D. It also evaluates the distributed VM system by comparing it to the conventional standalone CAD/CAM system.

2007
Network virtual reality is an advanced, distributed interactive and collaborative computer graphics technology for presenting information and exploring data in the 3D virtual environment. In this paper, a real-time network virtual military simulation system is developed. The digital terrain model and SPOT images of the Geographic Information System are integrated with the weather simulation of the particle system to construct a 3D virtual environment.

A Non-Photorealistic Rendering Images By A Handheld Device
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
From phantom haptic devices, 3D mouse to multimodal interfaces, while the academics contend about the similarities and differences in theoretical approaches and understanding of the next generation of interfaces in the pursuit of formulating research directions; researchers are actively pursuing the emergence of the next generation of human-computer interaction predictions, discussing emerging new interaction styles and interface designs; few or almost none has discussed the exquisite offerings, the use and merits of using simply the age old two-button mechanical mouse in the artistic interactive taxonomy. This paper presents an exclusive range of results created by the autonomous, ubiquitous and pervasive handheld interaction of the mechanical mouse. It discusses the tangible interfaces -- lightweight, tacit, passive, perceptual and non-command line interaction interface. The core of this framework is founded of an event-based dab-and-scribe, press-and-release dexterity in a discrete or continuous process as an user interface widget. It eliminates the necessity of extra input layers, offers instant visualization and demonstrates the embodied interfaces of this handheld device technology. This approach and practice establishes that such handheld device is an indispensable tool that offers end- to-end solution from instant conceptualization to visualization thus bridging the gap between desire, creative thinking and realization that reigns. The author, creator of an extensive repertoire of NPR images, compares the sensitivity of this wired two-button mechanical roller ball mouse versus a high precision laser mouse while she profiles the futility of the wireless self-powered optical mouse as well as the pen tablet.

Analyzing a Digital Image in a Way that is Useful to a Student of Art
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization
None
2007
When traditional artists are painting they will often look at their work in a dark room (or sometimes by candle light). This filters out most of detail information (which our eyes don't perceive well in the dark) and also removes the color from an image. The artist is then free to asses the paintings all-important tonal structure as well as it's large masses. There are many such tricks in the artist's lexicon and they all serve to provide valuable feedback to the many complex structures that underpin a manufactured image. This feedback is especially useful to the student who is needful of an impartial reflection upon their progress. What are the equivalents to such tricks in digital practice? What unique visual feedback do they offer and how can it be used?

In this paper, a 3D graphics environment for virtual garment design and simulation is presented. The proposed system enables the three dimensional construction of a garment from its cloth panels, for which the underlying structure is a mass-spring model. The garment construction process is performed through automatic pattern generation, posterior correction, and seaming. Afterwards, it is possible to do fitting on virtual mannequins as if in a real life tailor's workshop. The system provides the users with the flexibility to design their own garment patterns and make changes on the garment even after the dressing of the model.

Video Stabilization Using Scale-Invariant Features
2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization

2007
Video Stabilization is one of those important video processing techniques to remove the unwanted camera vibration in a video sequence. In this paper, we present a practical method to remove the annoying shaky motion and reconstruct a stabilized video sequence with good visual quality. Here, the scale invariant (SIFT) features, proved to be invariant to image scale and rotation, is applied to estimate the camera motion. The unwanted vibrations are separated from the intentional camera motion with the combination of Gaussian kernel filtering and parabolic fitting. It is demonstrated that our method effectively removes the high frequency 'noise' motion, but also minimize the missing area as much as possible. To reconstruct the undefined areas, resulting from motion compensation, we adopt the mosaicing method with Dynamic Programming. The proposed method has been confirmed to be effective over a widely variety of videos.

Three dimensional (3D) and computer graphics (CG) industries nowadays require 'instant' realism and extreme special effects while imposing the balance in cost, time and solution acceptance standard. It has been known that realistic rendering is time consuming, difficult to use, complex, expensive and often produces insufficient digital output to predict particularly in the early visualization process. This paper focuses on one of the emerging technologies, High dynamic range image (HDRI) and how it can be developed in achieving effective solution, while maintaining 'realism' or required result based on a specific application. We firstly introduce the overall HDRI processes before continue to present a framework of captured low density range image (LDRI) source sequence effectively in HDRI environment. This paper concludes with discussions and lists the application of HDRI.

Consider mobility and flexibility to be part of musical instrument design architecture and playing the instrument as a choreography with 3D installation. I-Musika: MIME (mobile interface musical expression) is a multidimensional interface that seeks to integrate at least three "disjoint neighborhoods" or entities: "keys, instruments and players". Based on the frequency resonating structures modeling paradigm, I-Musika: MIME transfigures the properties and geometry of musical instrument and unifies the excitation methods for different instruments, thus offering multiple (distinct) designs for a single instrument or a single design for multiple (distinct) instruments via an interface that provides contact free playing. As such, not only it transforms the keys-instruments-players relationship and creates new performing style that is insensitive to posture, hand and finger positioning, it creates a new audience-player-instrument profile. Harnessing the properties of this interface, I-Musika: MIME, the new instrument is portable with an artistic physical appearance or visual representation as desired. It can be modified and achieved as you pleased to add another dimension to musical pleasure. This paper presents the framework of the conceptual communication paradigm between key to instrument, instrument to instrument and instrument to player, as described. It provides an overview of instrument design and the playing methods.

This paper presents Sidh-a game based firefighter training simulator developed in cooperation between the University ofSkvde and the Swedish Rescue Services Agency. Sidh is based on computer game hardware and software solutions but adds a novel interaction model and gameplay specifically developed for the purpose of training firefighters. The simulator environment is a cave where the player is interacting with the game through a set of sensors. Players move in the virtual world by movements in the physical world and a substantial physical effort is required to accomplish game tasks. Sidh has been used in a feasibility study where 31 firefighter students have been playing the game and the performance of these students as well as their reflections from using the game have been analyzed. Results from this study show that Sidh is a useful complement to traditional training methods and that the subjects give very high grades on the entertainment value of the game which indicate that this form of training may be self-motivating which is an important issue for voluntary, after-hours training.

In this paper we report results from an experimental study of games and traffic safety performed in an advanced gaming environment. During car simulator-sessions we collected data over different traffic safety variables, such as speed, headway distance and lane change behavior, from 70 subjects. The data was analyzed in order to investigate possible individual learning effects and differences between groupings of subjects. The experiment shows clear positive individual learning effects for all traffic safety variables analyzed. Hence we conclude that game based simulations can be used to enhance learning in driving education.

Do software engineering students need interdisciplinary skills? Do students learn different things from an interdisciplinary project work than from software development projects? How can a specific interdisciplinary project course be organized? This paper provides reflections about these questions, based on the experience gained through running a project-based interdisciplinary course thrice. This course is part of the master degree education at the NTNU, Trondheim, Norway. Students taking the course work in teams of five, often coming from study programs of quite different disciplines. There is no predefined project assignment, instead the teacher has only described an open-ended theme, within which different student teams then define their own project assignment. The paper provides some reflections and lessons learned that can be exploited for designing similar interdisciplinary team project courses in other universities.

This paper responds to renewed interest in the centuries old question of what is a diagram. Existing status of our understanding of diagrams is seen as unsatisfactory and confusing. This paper responds to this by proposing a framework for understanding diagrams based on symbolic and spatial mapping. The framework deals with some complex problems any useful definition of diagrams has to deal with. These problems are the variety of diagrams, meaningful dynamics of diagramming, handling change in diagrams in a well formed way, and all of this in the context of semantically mixed diagrams. A brief description of the framework is given discussing how it addresses the problems.

Interactive Quantification of Categorical Variables in Mixed Data Sets
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Data sets containing a combination of categorical and continuous variables (mixed data sets) are difficult to analyse since no generalized similarity measure exists for categorical variables. Quantification of categorical variables makes it possible to represent this type of data using techniques designed for numerical data. This paper presents a quantification process of categorical variables in mixed data sets that incorporates information on relationships among the continuous variables into the process, as well as utilizing the domain knowledge of a user. An interactive visualization environment using parallel coordinates as a visual interface is provided, where the user is able to control the quantification process and analyse the result. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated using two mixed data sets.

Visualization and Level-of-Detail Control for Multi-Dimensional Bioactive Chemical Data
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
We previously applied our own hierarchical data visualization technique for structure-activity relationship (SAR)analyses of biochemical data. The study applied a recursive partitioning to store the drugs as hierarchical data,based on their chemical structures, and visualized the hierarchy of drugs. Though the activity data of drugs is usually multi-dimensional, our previous work did not represent the multi-dimensional values onto one display space. This paper presents a technique for visualizing hierarchical multidimensional data, and its level-of-detail (LOD) control,for visualization of multi-dimensional bioactive chemical data. The technique is an extension of our hierarchical data visualization technique, where the extended technique places leaf-nodes as well as the original hierarchical data visualization technique, and represents multi-dimensional values by dividing the icons of the leaf nodes.

On the Beauty and Usability of Tag Clouds
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Tag clouds are text-based visual representations of a set of tags usually depicting tag importance by font size. Recent trends in social and collaborative software have greatly increased the popularity of this type of visualization. This paper proposes a family of novel algorithms for tag cloud layout and presents evaluation results obtained from an extensive user study and a technical evaluation. The algorithms address issues found in many common approaches, for example large whitespaces, overlapping tags and restriction to specific boundaries. The layouts computed by these algorithms are compact and clear, have small whitespaces and may feature arbitrary convex polygons as boundaries. The results of the user study and the technical evaluation enable designers to devise a combination of algorithm and parameters which produces satisfying tag cloud layouts for many application scenarios.

2008
There are already several tools available that are capable of visualizing RDF data. The problem with RDF data is that they tend to be very large. To handle the data, the visualizers cannot display the whole data but rather need to use some kind of navigation. We have designed and implemented such visualizer. This paper describes our approach to the navigation, which was designed specifically with the preservation of the user's mental map in mind. We also compare our approach to the other visualizers.

Visualization of Clustered Directed Acyclic Graphs without Node Overlapping
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Conventional force directed graph drawing methods aim to produce aesthetically pleasing visualization of graphs. The edges of the graph have more or less equal length, and there are as few crossing edges as possible. This paper proposes a new e-spring algorithm for visualizing clustered directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) without node overlapping, extended from the popular spring embedder model. In our framework, nodes are modeled as nonuniform charged particles with weights, and a final drawing is derived by adjusting the positions of the nodes according to a combination of spring forces and repulsive forces derived from electrostatic forces between the nodes. Experimental results and visualization/analysis of this method are reported.

Directions for Methodological Research in Information Visualization
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
People within and outside the information visualization community are motivated to create new tools to address their own unique problems of understanding data. However, the techniques which visualizations use to enhance cognition of data are not widely known outside the field. Also, there are currently few resources which comprehensively describe methods for designing novel visualizations. Consequently, people who seek to build new information visualization tools are left to consult design examples, guidelines, and reference models, which do not adequately describe the visualization design process or suggest ways to undertake the process. We identify some of these shortcomings, provide an overview of methodological knowledge in information visualization design to date, and suggest that methods from other design-oriented disciplines can bridge these shortcomings.

Candidate Mapping: Finding Your Place Amongst the Candidates
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
The process of voting for a candidate involves selecting an individual who best matches a personal system of values and beliefs. Typically, voters must select a candidate whom they believe fits their issue stances best by determining their approximate similarity to the candidates on the issues, and cognitively positioning themselves amongst the candidates. We show in the context of our candidate position data that the intrinsic dimensionality of candidate similarity in our data can be sufficiently expressed algorithmically in two dimensions using Gower similarity and Sammon mapping. A participant study analyzes how voters choose to position themselves on this low dimensional representation, and how this positioning is related to the position dictated by their actual responses to issues, as well as to their general political stance.

Comparing Information Visualization Tools Focusing on the Temporal Dimensions
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Empirical comparisons and categorizations of information visualization tools lack important considerations: the former undervalue the need for a theoretical background, and the latter tend to have too much distance from the user because they do not consider definite user tasks. Therefore, our work combines these approaches and presents the results of both a qualitative evaluation and a recently published categorization. We focus on the visualization of temporal data and reveal that current tools realize only a small part of the visualization possibilities in this field.

As a preprocessing, this new system applies tree-structured clustering to images based on their keywords and pixel values, and selects representative images for each cluster. When a user specifies one or multiple keywords, CAT extracts a branch of the tree structure that contains clusters described by the user-specified keywords. A hierarchical data visualization technique is developed to display the tree structured organization of images using nested rectangular regions. Interlocked to the zooming operation, CAT selectively shows representative images while zooming out, or individual images while zooming in.

Layout Methods for Intuitive Partitioning of Visualization Space
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
In this paper we address two relevant tasks in image visualisation research: layout methods for presenting content and relations within image databases; and optimal solutions for efficient use of the entire display space. We introduce a novel approach to enable users searching on large image archives to distinguish heterogeneous sets of images. Thus, helping them to navigate or browse image databases according to relevant query directions. Two methods for mapping similarity relations between images and cognitive partitioning of the display space are presented.

GPGPU-based Gaussian Filtering for Surface Metrological Data Processing
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Engineering surfaces are characterized by the form, waviness and roughness features that are comprised of a range of spatial wavelengths. Filtering techniques are commonly adopted to separate these different wavelength components into well-defined bandwidths for further processing. The Gaussian filtered surface in which a 2D Gaussian filter is employed for surface assessments has been recommended by the ISO 11562-1996 and ASME B46-1995 standards to establish a reference surface. For Gaussian filtering, computational efficiency is a key problem when it is issued on a large set of surface metrology data. In the past this problem was tackled through reducing computation amount by the design and adoption of some fast algorithms. In this paper, a general purpose computing on GPU (GPGPU) framework is discussed to accelerate 2D Gaussian filtering for surface characterization. This framework takes advantage of the GPUpsilas parallel computing ability and has achieved better data efficiency without reducing the computational amount while maintaining the filtering quality. Filtering results and their accuracy from this model have been compared with the results obtained from the MATLAB simulation kits and the satisfied outcomes were observed.

2008
In this paper we suggest the ceiling as a new physical surface for information visualization. To provide a design framework for application designers, we present the notion of 'information sky'. This concept is based on (1) the metaphor of the natural sky, (2) historical examples of ceiling art and (3) recent computing paradigms, including mediatecture, ubiquitous computing and ambient display. We further introduce three distinct categories that denote potential application domains for ceiling-based data visualizations. Finally, we present four different application scenarios we have developed using prototyping and user-centered design techniques, and discuss how they relate to the categories.

An Interview-Based User Study on the use of Visualizations for Folder Browsing
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Hierarchically structured data collections often need to be visualized for the purposes of digital information management and presentation. File browsing, in particular, has an inherent hierarchical structure and plays an important role in the context of personal information management (PIM). A multitude of file browsers are nowadays available, offering different functionalities, while users adopt diverse practices and habits for browsing activities. In this paper, we investigate these aspects to obtain insights into their advantages and disadvantages and suggest solutions in the area of PIM, as well as in other domains employing similar visualization paradigms. The presented study focuses on the two most widespread visualizations used by file browsers, the indented list and zoomable interface paradigms, and assesses their effectiveness for various tasks and contexts, both by exploiting results on existing evaluations on hierarchy visualizations and folder hierarchy visualizations in particular, and by conducting an interview-based user study.

The Impact of Multiple Coordinated Views on the Visual Data Exploration and Analysis
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
The use of information visualization tools that support multiple coordinated views for data exploration and analysis has become more frequent. However, few usability studies have focused this group of tools. The goal of this paper is to perform usability experiments with tools supporting multiple coordinated views on the same screen, in separate screens and tools that support each technique individually. To ensure a fair evaluation, a complexity-based task taxonomy was developed. The tools were therefore used to answer questions of the same level of complexity.

Visualization of Gene Combinations
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation

2008
Advances in the field of microarray technology have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. More and more biological experiments are conducted based on microarrays. The challenge researchers face today is to analyze and understand the collected data. We present a visual approach to support understanding microarray data. In contrast to other visualization techniques, which represent expression of genes, we go one step further and make a switch to combinations of genes. Gene combinations bear more information, and hence, can lead to new hypotheses about the data. However, the increased amount of information imposes several challenges to an interactive visualization approach. We propose analytical and visual methods to deal with these challenges.

Flexible Method for Producing Static Visualizations of Log Data
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
The aim in this work was to develop a method to visualize log files produced by a pilot study of an experimental e-learning platform. The e-learning system running on a web server generated detailed descriptions of its usage that were analyzed. The log files were produced to allow the project's researchers to study offline how the system was utilized. We used open-source software tools to create a flexible system that processed a large amount of log data into concise visual representations. The visualizations revealed a set of different interaction patterns during the pilot study and showed that each teacher had a large effect on students' interaction with the system. Thus, the results showed that the suggested visualization method can be used to support the evaluation and training of students' proficiency in a learning environment.

No Going Back: An Interactive Visualization Application for Trailblazing on the Web
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
This paper presents the design of a new web browser, the Tree Trailblazer, which allows users to browse the web while maintaining a visual record of their exploration path, or trail, through the information space. This design enhances the backtracking aspects of web browsing over current designs by providing visual cues regarding the pages related to the page being viewed, providing users with an understanding of their position in the trail. This design also helps users blaze new trails off a page by allowing them to open previews of pages off of the currently viewed page. The scenario based design process that was used to construct the browser is discussed in conjunction with the initial prototype implementation. A formative user evaluation of this prototype showed this browser design to be very easy to learn and highly usable, with particular attention being paid to aspects of the tree visualization.

Visualizing Time-Dependent Data in Multivariate Hierarchic Plots - Design and Evaluation of an Economic Application
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
For successfully competing in a modern economy, large amounts of hierarchic time-dependent data need to be analyzed. As an example, one could consider the geographic composition of inflation in the European Union, or the revenue by product (sub) categories of a firm in the last month. Analysts wish to interpret the structure of the data not only at a single point in time, but examine the changes in the data categories through time. The analysts may need to consider additional dimensions to composition and time, such as the growth rate or profit rate. To reflect such analytic requirements, we have developed an interactive visualization of multi-dimensional, structured data taking the time dimension into account. The data are displayed in a three dimensional hierarchic circular or column plot. The time dimension of the data is represented by animation. Our system provides interactive tools for the visual data analysis and variable set-up of the data display. For better orientation in the data space, we have enhanced the visualization with smooth transitions between different data selections in case of 3D hierarchic plots. The techniques presented can be applied to various data domains. A user study using European inflation data has shown the usefulness for effective economic analysis.

A Dual-View Visualization of In-Car Communication Processes
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
With the increasing complexity of in-car communication architectures, their diagnostics have become essential for automotive development and maintenance. In order to help engineers to detect and analyze the potential sources and consequences of errors, it is crucial to provide both comprehensive and detailed insight into the communication processes and their contexts. Two important aspects of these are the dependencies and correlations between onboard functions. In this paper we present a dual-view visualization for exploring the functional dependency chains of in-car communication processes. One view presents the dependencies of hardware components using a space filling approach similar to a treemap, whereas the other view displays the functional correlations as an interactive sequence chart. The views are coupled via color coding and show the dependencies of an interactively selectable functional unit. In an expert evaluation, we assessed the benefits of using this visualization technique for in-car communication diagnostics with very positive results.

Knoocks: New Visualization Approach for Ontologies
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Ontologies are becoming popular in various communities. They give users the possibilities to understand, exchange, analyze or share knowledge of a specific domain. However ontologies can be very large and complex and therefore visualizations should help the user to understand and manipulate ontologies easily. Most visualizations concentrate on the structure of ontologies. For users, instances are often more interesting, because they represent the real world objects. This paper presents Knoocks (knowledge blocks) as a visualization approach which focuses on instances related to their structure. An evaluation which compared Knoocks with Jambalaya and CropCircles showed its benefits in visualizing instances.

2008
Publishing information on the Semantic Web using common formats enables data to be linked together, integrated and reused. In order to fully leverage the potential for interlinking data by reusing existing schemas, an intuitive way of viewing current usage of RDF vocabularies is required. We present a system which allows a user to view the most frequently occurring name spaces and classes in a large Semantic Web dataset, and the main linkage patterns that exist between them. Users can select a namespace of interest in order to examine usage of a particular ontology, and see how it is being combined with other vocabularies.

Visualization Enhanced Semantic Wikis for Patent Information
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
In this paper we present a new approach for using semantic wikis for collaborative patent search and annotation. We describe an extension that allows integrating interactive visualizations into semantic wikis for getting deeper insights into the classificatory, geographical, and temporal distribution of large patent sets. This approach differs from typical wiki usage scenarios in the sense that it combines automatic content generation based on patent search activities of the users with user driven semantic annotation of patent information, e.g. patent rating, linking with prior art, reviews, translations, discussions, etc. The content generation involves a semantic model that is described in terms of different ontologies for patent information. A modern wiki system is used for semantic annotation, comments, discussions, versioning, notification, and full-text search. Our approach is motivated by using available functionalities of a modern wiki system in combination with visualization techniques to directly implement major user requirements for supporting the knowledge-intensive tasks of patent search and understanding.

2008
There have been many attempts to create software that would allow the users to design SQL queries visually, even though it is not very natural to handle relations and relational algebra (the theoretical background of SQL) this way. But the RDF data format is based on directed labeled graphs, whose visual representation is very natural. We have created an RDF visualizer and tried to extend it to support query construction. It turned out that the nature of current RDF query languages only allows some basic support but prevents creation of a more sophisticated system. This articles describes our query generator and discusses the limiting factors.

Visual Analytics Presentation Tools Applied in HTML Documents
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
In this paper we present novel means to communicate and present gained knowledge using semi-guided interactive visualizations embedded in standard HTML documents. The goal of the work is to let the analyst (author) explore data and simultaneously save important discoveries and thus enable collaboration and sharing of gained insights over the Internet. The readers of the document will benefit from receiving an integrated and interactive document that can "coach" them in the understanding and testing of hypotheses leading to faster understanding and a higher confidence level in the presented visual information. The approach is based on the visual analytics (VA) toolkit (GAV), which also provides a mechanism that supports the storage of interactive events in an analytical reasoning process through "memorized interactive visualization views" or snapshots that can be saved at any time during an explorative data analysis process. In a typical scenario an application, comprised of GAV VA components, is embedded in the HTML document together with target data and the snapshots of discoveries. Any standard HTML event, such as the user clicking a textual link or an image can be used to instantiate a snapshot, creating a link between a descriptive text and an interactive visualization presentation. As the GAV application and corresponding data are integrated with the HTML code, residing on the client machine, hardware accelerated graphics can be used to provide interactive performance of demanding visualizations. We demonstrate the potential of the developed methods in the context of geoanalytics and molecular visualization scenarios.

The efficacy of search engines has expanded the uses for the information available on the Web. An increasing number of applications make use of the WWW as a primary source of information. The usefulness of such applications is, however, impaired by the current styles of display of the Web search results. This paper presents a system that adapts two techniques to map and explore Web results visually in order to find relevant patterns and relationships amongst the resulting documents. The first technique creates a visual map of the search results using a content-based multidimensional projection. The second techniques is capable of identifying, labeling and displaying topics within sub-groups of documents on the map. The system (The Projection explorer for the WWW, or PEx-Web) implements these techniques and various additional tools as means to make better use of Web search results for exploratory applications.

Visualizing Statistical Properties of Smoothly Brushed Data Subsets
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
In many application fields, the statistical properties of data sets are of great interest for data analysts. Since local variations can occur especially in large datasets, it is useful to visualize not only global values, but also the properties of user-defined subsets. Hence, we present in this paper a visualization of the statistical characteristics of subsets, with an emphasis on the temporal development. The visualization is coordinated with other views. They provide details about the data and allow for smooth brushing of subsets, a concept that introduces a continuous transition from data in focus to context data. Our approach accounts for smooth brushing in both the derivation and the visualization of statistical properties in order to visualize variations within subsets. To analyze differences between multiple subsets, our approach further integrates visualization concepts for the comparison of statistical properties. An application example from the simulation of biological systems demonstrates the benefits of our approach.

Quantifying and Comparing Features in High-Dimensional Datasets
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation

2008
Linking and brushing is a proven approach to analyzing multi-dimensional datasets in the context of multiple coordinated views. Nevertheless, most of the respective visualization techniques only offer qualitative visual results. Many user tasks, however, also require precise quantitative results as, for example, offered by statistical analysis. In succession of the useful Rank-by-Feature Framework, this paper describes a joint visual and statistical approach for guiding the user through a high-dimensional dataset by ranking dimensions (1D case) and pairs of dimensions (2D case) according to statistical summaries. While the original Rank-by-Feature Framework is limited to global features, the most important novelty here is the concept to consider local features, i.e., data subsets defined by brushing in linked views. The ability to compare subsets to other subsets and subsets to the whole dataset in the context of a large number of dimensions significantly extends the benefits of the approach especially in later stages of an exploratory data analysis. A case study illustrates the workflow by analyzing counts of keywords for classifying e-mails as spam or no-spam.

Coordinated and Multiple Views for Visualizing Text Collections
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation

2008
Multiple views have been put forward as an alternative to assist exploration of evolving phenomena or associations between distinct data sets or distinct presentations of a single data set. Coordinating between views is a challenge that must be met to improve visualization support for exploratory tasks. This is particularly true for high-dimensional data, such as document collections. We introduce a coordination framework for multiple views of document collections created using projections and point placement visualizations. Coordination can occur between different views of a single data set or between views of multiple data sets. Multiple coordinations are also admitted. Three new types of coordination are presented to illustrate the framework; these have been implemented in a multipurpose multi-dimensional visualization system called PEx (Projection Explorer).

We describe the circumstances that led to the development of the multiple view aspects of the application and how it emerged that different views were indeed suited to different tasks.

Getting to know clients and their behavior is essential in the growing process of any company that searches for improvement and business opportunities. One of the ways to discover more about their clientspsila behavior is to analyze the history of their transactions with the company or partners. The amount of transactions is often huge, what demands tools that help explore and analyze data in search for patterns or outliers. The tool used in this paper is called PRISMA and is based on multiple coordinated visualization techniques. Its major goal is to enhance the userpsilas perception about data and what is related to it, identifying problems that might occur during transactions, in order to improve or find business opportunities in them.

The surveillance of large sea areas often generates huge amounts of multidimensional data. Exploring, analyzing and finding anomalous behavior within this data is a complex task. Confident decisions upon the abnormality of a particular vessel behavior require a certain level of situation awareness that may be difficult to achieve when the operator is overloaded by the available information. Based on a visual analytics process model, we present a novel system that supports the acquisition of situation awareness and the involvement of the user in the anomaly detection process using two layers of interactive visualizations. The system uses an interactive data mining module that supports the insertion of the user's knowledge and experience in the creation, validation and continuous update of the normal model of the environment.

Similarity-Based Visualization of Time Series Collections: An Application to Analysis of Streamflows
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation

2008
Time series analysis poses many challenges to professionals in a wide range of domains. Several visualization solutions have been proposed for exploratory tasks on time series collections. For large data sets, however, current techniques fail to provide a global view that supports a good association between groups of similar time series. We employ fast multidimensional projection techniques to create concise visual representations of a collection of time series. The whole collection can be viewed in a two-dimensional graph-based representation that provides a starting point for further exploration and detailed analysis. The projections employ distance metrics to compare the series and generate a layout that attempts to group those with similar behavior. We illustrate the approach on a real data set containing streamflows describing the behavior of hydroelectric power plants in Brazil.

ARC-UI: Visualization Tool for Associative Classifiers
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
The classification of an unknown item based on a training data set is a key data mining task. An important part of this process that is often overlooked is the user's comprehension of the classifier and the results it produces. Associative classifiers begin to address this issue by using sets of simple rules to classify items. However, the size of these rule sets can be an obstacle to understandability. In this work, we present an interactive visualization system that allows the user to visualize various aspects of the classifier's decision process. This system shows the rules that are relevant to the classification of an item, the ways in which the item's characteristics relate to these rules, and connections between the item and the classifier's training data set. The system also contains a speculation component, which allows the user to modify rules within the classifier, and see the impact of these changes. Thus, this component allows the user to contribute domain expertise to the classification process, consequently improving the accuracy of the classifier.

A Web Usage Mining Approach Based on LCS Algorithm in Online Predicting Recommendation Systems
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
The Internet is one of the fastest growing areas of intelligence gathering. During their navigation Web users leave many records of their activity. This huge amount of data can be a useful source of knowledge. Advanced mining processes are needed for this knowledge to be extracted, understood and used. Web Usage Mining (WUM) systems are specifically designed to carry out this task by analyzing the data representing usage data about a particular Web site. WUM can model user behavior and, therefore, to forecast their future movements. Online prediction is one Web Usage Mining application. However, the accuracy of the prediction and classification in the current architecture of predicting users' future requests systems can not still satisfy users especially in huge Web sites. To provide online prediction efficiently, we advance an architecture for online predicting in Web Usage Mining system and propose a novel approach based on LCS algorithm for classifying user navigation patterns for predicting users' future requests. The Excremental results show that the approach can improve accuracy of classification in the architecture.

Effectiveness of Machine Learning Techniques for Automated Identification of Calling Communities
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
In this paper, we demonstrate how cluster analysis can be used to effectively identify communities using information derived from the Call Detail Record (CDR) data. We use the information extracted from the cluster analysis to identify customer calling patterns. Customers calling patterns are then given to a classification algorithm to generate a classifier model for predicting the calling communities of a customer. We apply two different classification methods: Support vector machine and fuzzy-genetic classifier. The latter method is used for possibly assigning a customer to different classes with different degrees of membership. The reported test results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Stalker, A Multilingual Text Mining Search Engine for Open Source Intelligence
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation

2008
The revolution in information technology is making open sources more accessible, ubiquitous, and valuable. The international Intelligence Communities have seen open sources grow increasingly easier and cheaper to acquire in recent years. But up to 80% of electronic data is textual and most valuable information is often hidden and encoded in pages which are neither structured, nor classified. The process of accessing all these raw data, heterogeneous in terms of source and language, and transforming them into information is therefore strongly linked to automatic textual analysis and synthesis, which are greatly related to the ability to master the problems of multilinguality. This paper describes a content enabling system that provides deep semantic search and information access to large quantities of distributed multimedia data for both experts and general public. STALKER provides with a language independent search and dynamic classification features for a broad range of data collected from several sources in a number of culturally diverse languages.

Web Mining for Open Source Intelligence
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Web mining for open source intelligence is the retrieval, extraction and analysis of information from on-line Internet sites. There are two separate applications areas this paper will review, namely live news-monitoring and targeted topic based data mining. Most newspapers and news agencies have Web sites with live updates on unfolding events, opinions and perspectives on world events. Most governments monitor news reports to feel the pulse of public opinion, and for early warning of emerging crises. The Joint Research Centre has developed significant experience in Internet content monitoring through its work on media monitoring (EMM) for the European Commission. EMM forms the core of the Commission's daily press monitoring service. Intelligence services and law enforcement agencies also require specific site monitoring and topic monitoring, and EMM technology has been applied to the wider Internet for this purpose. The software extracts and downloads all the textual content from monitored sites and applies information extraction techniques. These tools help analysts process large amounts of documents to derive structured data. Lastly the visualisation of the extracted data is important for analysts to identify patterns and trends derived from both news reports and Web mining.

2008
Assessing the potential property and social impacts of an event, such as tornado or wildfire, continues to be a challenging research area. From financial markets to disaster management to epidemiology, the importance of understanding the impacts that events create cannot be understated. Our work describes an approach to fuse information from multiple sources, then to analyze the information cycles to identify prior temporal patterns related to the impact of an event. This approach is then applied to the analysis of news reports from multiple news sources pertaining to several different natural disasters. Results show that our approach can project the severity of the impacts of certain natural disasters, such as heat waves on droughts and wild fires. In addition, results show that specific types of disaster consistently produce similar impacts when each time they occur.

Complexity science affords a number of novel tools for examining terrorism, particularly network analysis and NK-Boolean fitness landscapes. The following paper explores various aspects of terrorist networks which can be illuminated through applications of non-linear dynamical systems modeling to terrorist network structures. Of particular interest are some of the emergent properties of terrorist networks as typified by the 9-11 hijackers network, properties of centrality, hierarchy and distance, as well as ways in which attempts to disrupt the transmission of information through terrorist networks may be expected to produce greater or lesser levels of fitness in those organizations.

2008
Web mining is an intensive task which may yield significant insights that may revolutionise business and marketing by using effective information distribution, entertainment and communication techniques. For instance, corporations can optimise their eCommerce Websites to maximize impact and personalise the online content of their Websites. Corporations can use Web mining techniques for better understanding about their customers and thus will gain competitive edge by delivering the right information and services. This paper concentrates on reconstruction of visited session which was recorded in a Web log server. Existing approaches for reconstruction of users' session deal only with the time when a user accesses every page, whereas, in this paper, each visited page is incorporated with a pair of ordered time points, which we call biTemporal. Re-produced sessions can be used latter in different ways such as personalization, sequential pattern discovery, etc.

2008
A link mining study on a theft network is done in cooperation with Bursa Police Department in Turkey on more than 100,000 crimes and 6,000 persons. Group Detection Model (GDM) is based on co-occurrences of offenders in police arrest records for generating possible theft networks. Out of thousands of groups detected, only 63 ad-hoc theft groups are selected and introduced to the police experts. To evaluate these findings, one theft network is focused, a preliminary judge decision is obtained for phone tapping and group members phone conversations are eavesdropped for ten weeks. After verification of evidences, Operation Cash is launched. The police arrested 17 people, recovered worth $200,000 of stolen goods, and cash worth $180,000. Conviction and evidence showed that ruling members in offender networks can be detected using GDM. GDM uses a graph generative model and Social Network Analysis (SNA) for link mining in crime data.

2008
With the increased usage of the Web and its availability of data, various scholarly information is now available on the Web. Extraction, aggregation, and visualization of such information is crucial for using our collective scholarly knowledge and expertise. Semantic network technology is prominent in structuring such knowledge. Our research project is designed to construct a scholarly semantic network from publicly available data that will be useful for researchers, business people in industry, and public servants in governmental organizations who are expected to make decisions appropriately. In this paper, we propose a practical architecture to construct a scholarly semantic network that integrates different scholarly entities such as researchers, papers, and keywords by taking into consideration ontological and web mining perspectives. We also provide an overview of our social network extraction system, which is used as an underpinning to build the architecture. The system, called POLYPHONET, employs several advanced web mining and semantic technologies to extract relations of researchers, to detect groups of researchers, and to obtain keywords for a researcher. The public installation of the system at several academic conferences provides evidence of the system's usability and potential to facilitate the discovery of scholarly knowledge.

3D Generalization Lenses for Interactive Focus + Context Visualization of Virtual City Models
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Focus + context visualization facilitates the exploration of complex information spaces. This paper proposes 3D generalization lenses, a new visualization technique for virtual 3D city models that combines different levels of structural abstraction. In an automatic preprocessing step, we derive a generalized representation of a given city model. At runtime, this representation is combined with a full-detail representation within a single view based on one or more 3D lenses of arbitrary shape. Focus areas within lens volumes are shown in full detail while excluding less important details of the surrounding area. Our technique supports simultaneous use of multiple lenses associated with different abstraction levels, can handle overlapping and nested lenses, and provides interactive lens modification.

Geovisual analytics focuses on finding location-related patterns and relationship. Many approaches exist but generally do not scale well with large spatial datasets. We propose three enhancements that facilitate scalable geovisual analytics of voluminous geospatial data based on geographic mapping coordinated and linked with parallel coordinates (PC): 1) texture-based geographic mapping that exploits GPU-based rendering performance applied to overview + detail views, 2) statistical methods embedded in PC, 3) aggregated dynamic grid maps that integrate with PC. In this context, we have extended our previous introduced psilaGeoAnalyticspsila Visualization (GAV) framework and class library with a novel implementation of the standard PC using an atomic layered component architecture that allows new ideas to be implemented and assessed without having to rewrite a complete functional PC component. We demonstrate our proposed enhancements applied to a large geospatial dataset containing more than 10,000 Swedish zip (postal) code regions described by more than three million (X, Y) boundary coordinates and includes many associated demographics and statistical attributes.

Color coding is a widely used visualization method for scalar data. To generate expressive and effective visual representations, it is extremely important to carefully design the mapping from data to color. In this paper, we describe a color coding approach that accounts for the different tasks users might pursue when analyzing data. Our task description is based on the task model of Andrienko &amp; Andrienko. We apply different color scales and introduce strategies to adapt the color mapping function to support tasks like comparison, localization, or identification of data values.

This paper demonstrates the synergy of common InfoVis and GeoVis interaction techniques and the logistic application domain demonstrated in the customized visualize performance data (VISPER) application. In VISPER multi-dimensional, multi-source, time-varying and geospatial digital information from voyage analysis is represented to facilitate decision-making. Using common InfoVis components for multivariate data together with logistics visualization in a new synergy aids the users in their work examining ship and route performance. An evaluation of the usability was performed to gather insights for future development. The results from the evaluation show that the overall impression of VISPER was highly positive and participants enjoyed using it. Feedback obtained was highly valuable and directly applicable for improvements and further development.

Seven Types of Visual Ambiguity: On the Merits and Risks of Multiple Interpretations of Collaborative Visualizations
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
The use of visuals as collaboration catalysts has recently gained attention in research on group work, knowledge management, sense making, and collaboration in general. A special feature of such visualizations (i.e., sketches, diagrams, visual metaphors, etc.) is their ambiguity or their quality to be open to multiple interpretations. While such ambiguities may cause misunderstandings and lead to loosing valuable time, they also offer the potential to reveal new insights, facilitate ad-hoc discoveries, reframe issues, increase identification, or stimulate group sense making. In this article we propose that visual ambiguity in group contexts is a relational variable that depends on three elements: the properties of the image, the people interpreting the image, and the interaction. We use these categories to propose a more fine-grained categorization consisting of seven types visual ambiguity: icon, symbol, index, interpreter background, familiarity, reference and scope ambiguity. We discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of visual ambiguity for collaboration, as well as ways of exploiting or reducing it. Our contribution sensitizes researchers and practitioners to the crucial and often overlooked role of ambiguity in visual group communication, particularly in collaborative contexts. We highlight the diverse forms of visual ambiguity and how to use this communicative challenge as a resource rather than simply a risk. A discussion of future research needs concludes the article.

Creating Local Geographies for Map-Based Cyber Navigation
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation

2008
Although Internet and WWW phenomena are often described using spatial metaphors, the commonest means of geographic orientation - the map - is little used in online navigation. Maps of the physical world are however available online, as are maps illustrating physical Internet topography, semantic maps showing content linkages and maps of gaming environments, usually realistic simulations. Lacking an underlying geography, maps of entire virtual spaces such as cooperative knowledge spaces seem impossible or impractical as long as their sites are conceived only as unstructured or at most hierarchical) addresses. The ViCToR project (Virtual Cooperation in Teaching and Research) at the Technische Universitat Berlin uses a room metaphor to implement a shared, user-defined space for carrying out cooperative work in education and research. So far navigation in the hierarchically structured rooms is poorly developed. This paper explores the possibilities for implementing map-based domain navigation using a community-created local geography based on coordinates.

The Potential of Crowd Simulations for Communication Purposes in Architecture

2008
This article discusses an early stage of research on the potential of crowd simulation tools for (marketing) communication purposes in architecture and urban planning. We argue that today, in architecture and urban planning, agent-based simulation tools have been primarily used for analytical purposes, such as the simulation of pedestrians or fire escape scenarios in buildings, and only rarely for the creation of videos for communication purposes, for example for marketing purposes. We found that even with the best available software tools the cost-benefit ratio for architects is not yet optimal and that architects might - from an economic point of view - today be more effective if they outsource such a task to an animation specialist.This paper is relevant for architects, urban designers, communication and PR experts and for researchers in the fields of architecture, knowledge visualization, communication science, agent-based simulations.

Cluster-Based Visualization of Concept Associations

One of the steps in the knowledge domain visualization process is the display of the low-dimensional space in which the items under analysis are positioned. In this paper we investigate the visualization of concept associations by means of concept clustering and edge bundling, two techniques that help alleviate the cluttering caused by concept labels and edges. Hierarchical clustering is used for the identification of the different domain categories (i.e., clusters). The edges between pairs of concepts belonging to two clusters are aggregated in a single edge connecting the clusterspsila centers. The proposed approach enables us to discover the hierarchical structure of our knowledge domain and analyze the strength between the different domain categories.

The Visualization of Relatedness

2008
The relationships between documents are usually derived by accounting on the links between them. These linkages may take the form of citation, cocitation, hyperlink, or co-terms. The relatedness between documents is derived from link analysis, which is widely used in the information science disciplines. We use kernel functions to overcome the limitations of the relatedness measurement based on cocitation count which does not account on the indirect relationships. We then elicit all maximal cliques from the resultant kernel graph and visually explore the graph of connected cliques. The meaning of a clique in the graph is interpreted based on a preliminary content analysis of the literatures underlying the clique. We also study overlapping cliques by examining their sharing nodes. The common nodes of adjacent cliques seem to play a bridging role between distinct fields.

It is possible to recognize the importance of knowledge of configurative geometry for creative thinking, the scientific knowledge and the practice? Do we can attribute to a geometric knowledge a founding and fundamental role for the correct displaying of the knowledge of the cultural heritage? The answers are affirmative certainly understanding that if this knowledge not only allows manual graphics processing (and, consequently, digital), at the same time rigorous and expressive, but is also fundamental for the construction of charming and realistic in motion computer images. Moreover, flexible geometry still ensures achieving a high level of expressive capacity, spendable in any other experience of architects and engineers, aimed at both the documentation and the design of complex and articulate spaces and structures. Being inadequate the only paper for the restitution of the aspects of dynamism and of going trough architectural spaces, we propose the management, in a hypertext, of drawings, surveys, maps and historical iconography, real and digital movies of CAD reconstruction (taking, as a case study, the ecclesiastical architectural heritage of the Padova historic centre); management which, in different ways, provides the highest level of completeness and speed through an analysis of different resources.

Augmented Visualisation: Designing Experience for an Interpretative Cultural Heritage
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
The use of visualisation technologies is well established in digital cultural heritage. The earlier IT challenge of presenting material culture has largely been addressed with the production of high quality digital artefacts. A number of projects have drawn on the potential for augmented visualisation offered by mobile technologies, game engines and responsive environments. Alongside these advances is a recognition that a relevant digital cultural heritage needs to reflect contemporary interpretative practices rather than relying on outmoded systems of material science. While leading research in interpretative heritage has incorporated the hermeneutic aspects of previously lived cultures there have been less recognition of the importance of the userspsila role in the formation of cultural knowledge. The paper proposes that we take a step back to investigate the processes of knowledge formation. It provokes a series of new research questions on visualizing cultural heritage knowledge in light of theoretical readings on perception and knowledge formation. It points to the need to devise alternative methods for the design and production of an interpretative digital cultural heritage. Such methods detail the generative potential of a complex process rather than the replication of a complex structure.

The analysis of the historical evolution of the territories and landscapes has been seldom based upon the study of old cartographic documents; they have been always set in a second place after texts and writings. Trying to bridge this gap, we have designed and implemented a relational database of the ancient maps and charts that are already preserved in the main Spanish collections, archives and libraries, that includes the possibility to access to a a high resolution digital image of each one of them. The personalized queries to the database will allow the scholars and searchers to visualise the document together with its main features.

A Design Supporting System for Kimono Pattern Preservation
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation

2008
Kimono is a key point in Japanese culture. In the kimono market, one type of kimono was called Yukata. Yukata is always produced in mass production in considering price. In order to promote prestigious kimonos, kimono stores usually present new styles or customer-tailored designs in response to different seasons. Of the varied kimonos, it is possible to let customers choose the style they prefer. From this point of view, this study tries to explore the behavior of the customers who get involved in the design process of a kimono where they participate and endeavor to create and even to promote their individual appreciation and value. This study collected many cases consisting of different kimono patterns and tried to analyze and induce the grammar of kimono patterns. Then, based on this grammar, a design system of kimono pattern can be built. Customers use this design system to input their likes such as floriography and various flowers. This system provides information concerning visualized patterns such as pattern elements (color, alignment, and etc.). Finally, the pattern elements generated by the customerpsilas likes are incorporated into the kimono grammar. In other words, the grammar of kimono pattern is constructed and refined on the basis of the results of this design system. The refined grammar can be used to analyze the existing kimono patterns as well. Through the continuing refinement and analysis of the kimono grammar, we could trace back the history of a kimono by its pattern, and by use of the cycling work people are able to preserve one of the cultural assets - the kimono pattern, its design knowledge and Japanese cultural heritage.

This paper consists of a review of contemporary methods that map and materialize abstract data as physical artifacts. With computing technology and the access of information influencing every aspect of our everyday lives, one can question the current habit of information displays to dasiasimulatepsila real world metaphors, and whether information could instead be conveyed by approximating the analogue and tangible characteristics of our daily experiences. This paper introduces five different degrees of dasiadata physicalitypsila, which differ in the level of abstraction of how data is mapped and perceived by human senses: ambient display, pixel sculptures, object augmentation, data sculptures and alternative modality. This categorization demonstrates the potential of information visualization as a communication medium in its own right, which proliferates beyond the ubiquitous pixel-based, light-emitting surfaces of today.

Ambient intelligence is a rapidly developing field producing a new generation of applications and services demanding new, more complex strategies for usability testing and evaluation. In this paper, we identify caveats of traditional methods of application usability testing when applied to an ambient intelligent environment and we introduce a method for unified analysis of user behavior using a virtual environment visualization. For the usability testing in ambient environments, we propose to transform data (both data recorded in real settings and data artificially created by experts) into a virtual environment to cope with the following issues: a) overwhelming amount of data, b) proprietary data formats, and c) ethical codices issues. We describe a tool for creation of expert evaluation data and for transformation of data from video recordings and illustrate its use on two cases.

Optimal Font Size for Head-Mounted-Displays in Outdoor Applications
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Modern mobile IT-systems offer a great potential for various applications and enable a user to work autonomously, to communicate or to retrieve information nearly everywhere. However, displaying information outdoors is still challenging for the system designer. Numerous approaches of augmented reality (AR) tend to integrate additional information into the real context of the user's environment. Using this technology outdoors is strongly affected by special environmental conditions like lighting and background textures. These factors differ substantially from indoor and are likely to reduce the recognizing and reading performance, which is important in combination with different font colours. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the influence of background texture and font colour on text recognition performance. N=20 participants took part in the experiments. The results clearly show significant differences to the standards for desktop systems (10pt). Applying the resulting font sizes for outdoor systems will drastically reduce the amount of information that can be displayed.

Building the Mega-Collaboration Interface: Behavioral, Cultural, and Cognitive Factors in Visualization Support
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Technology has enabled mega-collaboration on an unprecedented scale. A tool is needed to coordinate these activities and link them to government response efforts. However, in defining and responding to problems, teammates need to be able to visualize each other's mental models. The tool must encourage the team to advance promptly through team "forming, norming, storming, and performing." Finally, it must help individual teams visualize efficiently the "big picture," using agents to enhance the process. The usability of a prototype mega-collaboration interface has been tested, the second generation interface is being implemented, and a novel agent-based interface is being planned.

Modified Virtual Reality for Intuitive Semantic Information Visualization
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
In order to make use of domain knowledge and thus to create less abstract visualizations of the available information, we propose to integrate information visualization techniques in 3D visualizations of the application subject. We describe a framework that is build on an ontology, an hierarchical visualization toolkit, and a modular concept of modeling 3D layouts. This allows us to integrate semantically related information directly in the scene. We achieve this integration by modifying the real world geometry in several ways. Our concept helps non-expert users to intuitively interact with the system and to understand what is going on.

Multitarget tracking using mean-shift with particle filter based initialization
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
This paper presents a multitarget tracking algorithm based on mean-shift, in which an automatic initialization process by particle filter is utilized. In the standard mean-shift algorithm, this initialization is necessary to construct the reference target model to track. In our approach, switching between the particle filter based detection and the mean-shift tracking is introduced. Furthermore, we extend mean-shift tracking with particle filter based initialization into multitarget tracking problem. We experimentally show that our method can track multiple targets in outdoor situation and can run in real-time on a PC.

Camera-based Scrolling Interface for Hand-held Devices
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Hand-held devices have become widespread and provided with significant computing capabilities, which results in an increasing pressure for using these devices to perform tasks formerly limited to notebooks, like web browsing. Due to their small screens, however, hand-held devices cannot visualize directly documents that were not designed explicitly for small-screen rendering. Such documents may be rendered either at a scale too small to be useful, or at a scale that requires intensive scrolling operations by the user. Unfortunately, scrolling a small window across a large document with a hand-held device is quite cumbersome. In this paper we propose a scrolling system much simpler and more natural to use, based on the embedded camera-a component available in every modern hand-held device. We detect device motion by analyzing the video stream generated by the camera and then we transform the motion in a scrolling of the content rendered on the screen. This way, the user experiences the device screen like a small movable window on a larger virtual view, without requiring any dedicated motion-detection hardware. We performed an experimental evaluation aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the proposed system in the considered scenario, characterized by low image quality, unpredictable framed scene and soon. We performed an objective benchmark quantifying the accuracy of the detected trajectory and a subjective benchmark examining users' confidence with the proposed system. For the latter evaluation, we involved a panel of 20 subjects that executed a trajectory with our system and, as a comparison, with keyboard, mouse and touchpad. The results demonstrate that our approach is indeed practical.

Visual Presentation Challenges for Mobile Spatial Applications: Three Case Studies
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Using mobile devices for exploring and interacting with the user's physical environment is among the most promising candidates for commercially successful future telecommunication services and applications. This trend is confirmed by the rollout of latest mobile phones equipped with advanced navigation features like built-in GPS receivers, digital compasses and acceleration sensors. The increasing technological potential of mobile spatial interaction (MSI), however, requires a wider comprehension of appropriate visualization possibilities for spatially referenced content in the field of mobile human-computer interaction. In this paper, we argue for an integrated approach comprising innovations in MSI with latest advances in visualization. In order to demonstrate the potential of this joint approach, we present a series of three related projects and highlight in each case research challenges and results in the field of mobile HCI and mobile appli-cation development as well as corresponding advances of the underlying server-side rendering algorithms.

The Potential for Synergy between Information Visualization and Software Engineering Visualization
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
To be provocative, it could be argued that information visualization is a tool in search of an application. This viewpoint becomes most apparent when one seeks to adopt and adapt practices from the information visualization field and attempt to apply them elsewhere. Software engineering is an appealing area in which a number of researchers have been seeking to leverage some of the benefits that information visualization can bring. Through an examination of the two fields, and their underlying motivations and foci, we highlight an as yet untapped area in which future research efforts should be directed to gain the most impact in software engineering. We also highlight recent concerns from the information visualization field to emphasize the role of establishing criteria through which new contributions can be assessed.

A Practical Way for Projects to Visualize Design Rationale
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Design rationale remains poorly explained and rarely modelled on projects in industry. However, the reasons for design decisions are important when a specification has to be re-examined, eg for reuse, for safety, for validation, or to satisfy stakeholders that a project is justified. A practical notation must be extremely simple but expressive, given industry's reluctance. This paper illustrates how a minimal box-and-arrow notation is sufficient for modelling Toulmin argumentation, and helpful on transportation projects. These critically depend on properly documented rationale as they are subject to public inquiry. The use of Dewar signposts to connect such rationale models to changing events in the world is illustrated.

Visually Summarising Software Change

2008
Many authors have noted the problem of excessive information when attempting to create useful visualisations of software. The problem of visualising change over multiple versions of software is more complex still. We present a means of visualising changes in software, founded on information-theoretic arguments, that easily and automatically summarises difference between software versions with respect to their code, their structure or their behaviour. Further, we show, by creating visualisations in experiments on real-world data, that the method is of utility to practitioners and has implications beyond the field of software visualisation.

2008
In this paper we present three software design patterns for rapid prototyping of information visualization applications. The first pattern describes a mapping of object oriented models to relational data tables used in many visualization frameworks. The second pattern describes a script based approach for the configuration of visualization applications. The third pattern addresses the problem of performing online changes on the visual mapping by enhancing fine-grained mapping operators with scripting capabilities. We present an implementation of the patterns, which is based on the Prefuse toolkit. Finally we discuss some experimental results according to performance issues.

A 3-dimensional variant of the 'polymetric views' approach for visualising metrics within an object oriented software system is presented. This variant provides simultaneous display of several metrics including coupling, the contribution made by coupling to interface rather than to concrete class, and an indication of behavioural polymorphism. A tool, JCTIViz, is described that implements this visualisation for Java systems and preliminary results from applying the tool are presented. Future enhancements to the approach and the tool are outlined.

Embedding Wellformed Euler Diagrams
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Euler diagrams are collections of labelled closed curves. They are often used to represent information about the relationship between sets and, as such, they have numerous applications including: visualizing biological data, diagrammatic logics, and visual database querying. Various methods to automatically generate Euler diagrams have been proposed. Typically, the generation process starts with an abstract description of an Euler diagram, which is then converted to a planar dual graph. Finally, the process attempts to embed the Euler diagram from the dual graph. This paper describes a method for embedding wellformed Euler diagrams from dual graphs. There are several mechanisms to generate dual graphs but, prior to the novel work described here, no general method for embedding a wellformed Euler diagram from a dual graph had been demonstrated. The method in this paper achieves an embedding of any wellformed Euler diagram. The method first triangulates the dual graph. Then, using the faces of the triangulated graph, an edge labelling technique identifies the vertices of polygons which form the closed curves of the Euler diagram. The method is demonstrated by a Java implementation. In addition, this paper discusses a number of layout improvements that can be explored for this embedding method.

Visualise Undrawable Euler Diagrams
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Given a group of overlapping sets, it is not always possible to represent it with Euler diagrams. Euler diagram characteristics might collide with the sets relationships to depict, making it impossible to outline a correct draw. In order to be able to show a greater class of instances, Euler diagrams have been extended allowing more general patterns, but so far all the most common definitions cannot represent all the possible connection between sets.We aim to introduce methods and constructions to produce a clear representation, as close as possible to Euler diagrams, even for sets that are not formally drawable in that way. We investigate on the reasons that make a diagram undrawable, in order to evaluate how and when to apply the mentioned structures, and to give the foundations necessary to design algorithms for this purpose.

A Planar Straight-line Grid Drawing Algorithm for High Degree General Trees with User-Specified Angular Coefficient
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
General trees are usually displayed as planar straight-line grid drawings which provide an easily understandable structure to the viewer. Current general tree drawing algorithms have one common problem: their drawings on high degree trees produce many small angles, which makes it difficult to distinguish edges. The algorithm we propose in this paper allows the user to provide an angular coefficient and then employs the 'best-effort-delivery' to draw edges such that the angles are above the angular coefficient. It allows the non-root nodes to place their children within a maximum of three quads of the Cartesian plane. When a node has too many children, resulting in an impossibility of achieving angles above the specified angular coefficient, our algorithm distributes all remaining children evenly among the three quads.

Edge Metrics for Visual Graph Analytics: A Comparative Study
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Visual graph analytics definitely relies on the use of node and edge metrics to identify salient properties in graphs. Most often, these metrics are turned into useful visual cues, or are used to interactively filter out parts of a graph while querying it, for instance. Along the years, analysts coming from different application domains have designed metrics to serve specific needs. Graph analytics, sometimes also called network science, recently developed as a cross-discipline field developing models shared by numerous application domains such as bio-informatics, social network analysis, web graphs, etc.[4] [10]. As a consequence, we end up finding various metrics in the literature aiming at similar goals; different names and analytics description often hide similarity between two metrics that originated from different fields. We survey a list of edge metrics for graphs and compare their relative value and behaviour, in an effort to organize them into a taxonomy and underline the genuine ingredients in each of them disregarding their origin.

A Simplification Algorithm for Visualizing the Structure of Complex Graphs
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
Complex graphs, ones containing thousands of nodes of high degree, are difficult to visualize. Displaying all of the nodes and edges of these graphs can create an incomprehensible cluttered output. This paper presents a simplification algorithm that may be applied to a complex graph in order to produce a controlled thinning of the graph. Using importance metrics, the simplification process removes nodes from the graph, leaving the central structure for visualization and evaluation. The simplification algorithm consists of two steps, calculation of the importance metrics and pruning. Several metrics based on various topological graph properties are described. The metrics are then used in a pruning process to simplify the graph. Nodes, along with their corresponding edges, are removed from the graph, while maintaining the graph's overall connectivity. This simplified graph provides a cleaner, more meaningful visual representation of the graph's structure; thus aiding the analysis of the graph's underlying data.

Edge Routing with Fixed Node Positions
2008 12th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2008
The two basic problems of graph drawing - drawing of nodes and drawing of edges - are often handled by one algorithm that finds suitable positions for both nodes and edges. However, there are situations where positions of nodes are fixed, for instance if they were defined by the user or the exact position of the nodes is somehow significant. In these cases we need an algorithm that draws only the edges no matter what the positions of the nodes are. This paper presents one such algorithm. We present the very basic version of the algorithm followed by two ways of improving it to produce better looking and clearer results.

EulerView incorporates a non-hierarchical classification structure to enable enhanced resource management. We apply the EulerView concept to the use of urls, constructing eli.icio.us which is a tool that realizes the EulerView concept and integrates it with del.icio.us. Currently, in del.icio.us, users can tag urls and browse for similar urls and the results can be displayed via an alphabetically sorted tag cloud. As well as facilitating easy tag management, using an EulerView display has the advantage that the user can use this representation for both tagging urls and for searching or browsing tasks, thus reducing any cognitive difficulties of users due to interacting with multiple representations.

Revealing Subnetwork Roles using Contextual Visualization: Comparison of Metabolic Networks

This article is addressing a recurrent problem in biology: mining newly built large scale networks. Our approach consists in comparing these new networks to well known ones. The visual backbone of this comparative analysis is provided by a network classification hierarchy. This method makes sense when dealing with metabolic networks since comparison could be done using pathways (clusters). Moreover each network models an organism and it exists organism classification such as taxonomies. Video demonstration: http://www.labri.fr/perso/bourqui/video.wmv.

A Graph Manipulation Visual Interface for Construction of e-Learning Systems

None
2008
In this paper, we propose a visual interface which assist managing educational courses in e-Learning systems. Educational courses in e-Learning systems can be represented as graphs. We design a simple interface which specializes in manipulation of educational courses only by movements of mouse. The feature of the interface is that we can manipulate graphs without pull down menus and buttons. We specify operations by drawing lines in the canvas window. For example, we can add an edge to a graph by drawing an arrow, and delete nodes and edges by drawing crossing lines on them. Since this is an application-dependent small system, we carefully select the operations and design the simple interface. We show which operations can be used in the interface and how we detect them from mouse movements.

Visual Perception of Parallel Coordinate Visualizations
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Parallel coordinates is a visualization technique that provides an unbiased representation of high-dimensional data. The parallel configuration of axes treats data dimensions uniformly and is well suited for exploratory visualization. However, first-time users of parallel coordinate visualizations can find the representation confusing and difficult to understand.We used eye tracking to study how parallel coordinate visualizations are perceived, and compared the results to the optimal visual scan path required to complete the tasks. The results indicate that even first-time users quickly learn how to use parallel coordinate visualizations, pay attention to the correct task-specific areas in the visualization, and become rapidly proficient with it.

VioNeS - Visual Support for the Analysis of the Next Sub-volume Method

2009
Computational simulation is an established method to gain insight into cellular processes. As the resulting data sets are usually large and complex, visualization can play a significant role in data analysis. In this paper, we focus on the visualization of simulation output from the next sub-volume method, a spatial simulation algorithm. In addition to the spatial context of the simulation output, its heterogeneous data types, multiple variables, and the temporal context make high demands on the visualization. To cope with these challenging characteristics, we systematically explore possible visualization concepts with respect to these characteristics. From these findings, we derive our specific solution to visualize the data from the next sub-volume method, using a framework of multiple coordinated views that emphasize the spatial context of the data. Combining these views with a highly interactive user interface, the user is able to adapt the visualization to his current analysis goals and explore the data in its complexity.

A Framework to Analyze Information Visualization Based on the Functional Data Model
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
We propose a framework for analyzing information visualization (infovis) based on the concept of functional dependency (FD). Although functional dependencies express important semantic information of data, they are rarely taken into account by general purpose infovis tools-- a fact that may cause problems in the visualization process. The main idea of our approach is to use the concept of FD for modeling the invariant structures of all three components of information visualization that is data, visual representations, and visual mappings.

Many-to-Many Relational Parallel Coordinates Displays
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
An interesting property of the commonly used parallel coordinates display is the distinct overall pattern formed by the totality of lines between adjacent axes. These patterns have a direct correspondence to the type of relationship existing between the variables mapped onto the axes in question as well as a salient visual appearance. Parallel coordinates displays can therefore be used to visually investigate relationships between variables as well as investigating individual objects/lines. The problem with this approach is that, whereas each object is mapped in its entirety in a standard parallel coordinates display, only a small subset of the interrelations between variables is shown as the number of variables increase. To show all possible relations between variables multiple parallel coordinates displays are needed. In turn this means that each variable is duplicated several times, once per extra parallel coordinates display. To a viewer this increases the visual complexity and most probably the mental load. To aid users we have devised a new configuration of the axes in multiple parallel coordinates displays. Through an experiment we have also started to investigate the usability of this new configuration and the results are promising.

HexBoard: Conveying Pairwise Similarity in an Incremental Visualization Space
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation

2009
We introduce the HexBoard space and visualization tool, that provides an incremental visualization space that conveys pairwise similarity among all neighboring elements from a dynamic data set. It is a significant evolution on our previous work, incBoard, a chess board analogy for displaying (projecting) objects from a dynamic set on a 2D space, considering their similarity in a higher dimensional space. HexBoard relays on hexagons to represent data items: the only regular polygons that provide a regular tessellation of the Euclidean plane and where neighboring elements always share an edge. These edges are then easily manipulated to convey pairwise similarity information, thus overcoming a serious limitation of the previous solution, while preserving all advantages of incBoard (no occlusion, coherent disposition of elements, inherently incremental solution and low computational cost). This paper introduces HexBoard, discusses its potential and illustrates its application with examples.

Occlusion is an important problem to be solved for readability improvement of 3D visualization techniques. This paper presents an occlusion reduction technique for cityscape-style 3D visualization techniques. The paper first presents an algorithm for occlusion reduction. It generates bounding boxes of 3D objects on the 2D display space, moves them to reduce their overlap, and finally reversely projects their movements onto the 3D space. The paper then presents an application of the algorithm to our own hierarchical data visualization technique, and a music browser based on the technique. The paper also shows several numerical evaluations that denote the effectiveness of the presented technique.

Hierarchical Temporal Patterns and Interactive Aggregated Views for Pixel-Based Visualizations

2009
Many real-world problems involve time-oriented data. Time data is different from other kinds of data--explicitly harnessing the structures of time in visualizations can guide and support userspsila visual analysis processes. State-of-the-art visualizations hardly take advantage of the structures of time to aid users in understanding and exploring the data. To bring more flexibility to the analysis process, we have developed interactive visual methods incorporating the structures of time within a pixel-based visualization called GROOVE (granular overview overlay). GROOVE uses different techniques to visualize time-oriented data by overlaying several time granularities in one visualization and provides interactive operators, which utilize the structures of time in different ways to capture and explore time-oriented data.

Numerous data mining methods have been designed to help extract relevant and significant information from large datasets. Computing concept lattices allows clustering data according to their common features and making all relationships between them explicit. However, the size of such lattices increases exponentially with the volume of data and its number of dimensions. This paper proposes to use spatial pixel-oriented and tree-based visualisations of these conceptual structures in order to optimally exploit their expressivity.

Visual Graph Comparison

Researchers and analysts in many fields are sometimes confronted with the task of comparing and contrasting two similar but different graphs or networks. This paper presents a technique and prototype tool to support the visual comparison of graphs and the interactive reconciliation of candidate graphs into a single reference graph. Given two input graphs and a set of similarities between nodes, the Semantic Graph Visualiser (SGV) computes a merged graph and allows the analyst to visually compare and contrast the two input graphs. In a specific example, given two differing models of essentially the same business process derived from different sources, a process engineer can visually compare them and reconcile them into a single reference model.

Suitable reference marks are an important part of creating an understandable visualization. The reference marks create the frame in which the data is understood, thereby preserving the context of the data and allowing the transition from data to information to be made. However, reference marks (including legends, axial and point labels) are given insufficient attention in many visualization frameworks. When explicitly present, they often require completely separate specification from the visualization for which they are a reference. This paper presents a framework independent method for deriving reference marks from the data analysis pathway. We also describe how this approach has been implemented in the Stencil library, and how it may be implemented in other libraries.

Probabilistic NeuroScale for Uncertainty Visualisation
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
This paper is a study of low dimensional visualisation methods for data visualisation under uncertainty of the input data. It focuses on NeuroScale, the feed-forward neural networks algorithm by trying to make the algorithm able to accommodate the uncertainty. The standard model is shown not to work well under high levels of noise within the data and need to be modified. The modifications of the model are verified by using synthetic data to show their ability to accommodate the noise.

A Visualization and Level-of-Detail Control Technique for Large Scale Time Series Data
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation

2009
We have various interesting time series data in our daily life, such as weather data (e.g., temperature and air pressure)and stock prices. Polyline chart is one of the most common ways to represent such time series data. We often draw multiple polylines in one space to compare the time variation of multiple values. However, it is often difficult to read the values if the number of polylines gets larger. This paper presents a technique for visualization and level-of-detail control of large number of time series data. The technique generates clusters of time series values,and selects representative values for each cluster, as a preprocessing. The technique then draws the representative values as polylines. It also provides a user interface so that users can interactively select interesting representatives,and explore the time series values which belong to the clusters of the representatives.

In this paper, we propose an information visualisation solution for multimedia retrieval based on semantic concepts defined in an image database. The proposed visualisation approach utilises concept map, Venn diagram and Fisheye distortion to enable effective and efficient visualisation of image database. In addition, the proposed approach enables displaying the local and global views of the collection subset, selected as relevant by the user. The proposed solution is evaluated on Corel 700 dataset with 10 semantic concepts for the following user actions: exploratory browsing, querying and detecting patterns.

TreemapBar: Visualizing Additional Dimensions of Data in Bar Chart
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation

2009
Bar chart is a very common and simple graph that is mainly used to visualize simple x, y plots of data for numerical comparisons by partitioning the categorical data values into bars and typically limited to operate on highly aggregated dataset. In todaypsilas growing complexity of business data with multi dimensional attributes using bar chart itself is not sufficient to deal with the representation of such business dataset and it also not utilizes the screen space efficiently.Nevertheless, bar chart is still useful because of its shape create strong visual attention to users at first glance than other visualization techniques. In this article, we present a treemap bar chart + tablelens interaction technique that combines the treemap and bar chart visualizations with a tablelens based zooming technique that allows users to view the detail of a particular bar when the density of bars increases. In our approach, the capability of the original bar chart and treemaps for representing complex business data is enhanced and the utilization of display space is also optimized.

RadViz and Identification of Clusters in Multidimensional Data

2009
RadViz visualization makes it possible to map data from n-dimensional space into a plane. The paper reviews those specific properties of this method that are important for identification of clusters in the original multidimensional data. First, there is described an artificial data set which clearly points to a certain drawback of the original RadViz mapping. To resolve the identified problem there are suggested 2 minor modifications of the RadViz algorithm. Finally, it is proved that application of both suggested modifications guarantees that the upper mentioned problem does not re-appear. This claim is experimentally confirmed by a new visualization of the two original data sets using the modified mapping algorithm.

Boundary Labeling in Text Annotation
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
The text annotation system of a word processor software provides the user the function of memorandums in editing a document. In the visualization interface of the annotation system, each marked word is connected to a text comment label on the right side of the document by a polygonal line. Such a visualization interface can be viewed as a one-side boundary labeling, in which each point site is uniquely connected to a label placed on the right side of an enclosing rectangle by a leader, which may be a rectilinear or straight line segment. In the literature, there have existed some applications and some theoretical results for the boundary labeling. In this paper, we investigate the boundary labeling from the application on the annotation system. For this kind of labeling, if the number of labels on the right side is large, the leaders may be drawn too densely to be recognized easily. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a polynomial time algorithm for the so-called 1.5-side boundary labeling for the annotation system, in which, in addition to being connected to the right side directly, leaders can be routed to the left side temporarily and then finally to the right side. In addition, we investigate a problem for two-side boundary labeling (for the annotation system) that was not discussed previously. We show the problem to be NP-complete, and then proposed a heuristic based on the genetic algorithm to solve it. The experimental results reveal that our approach performs well.

2009
Although laboratory user studies are the most common method for validating the utility of information visualization systems, it may be difficult to determine if such studies accurately reflect the tasks of real users. In this paper, we describe a longitudinal real-world user evaluation of a visual and interactive Web search interface designed to support exploratory searching: the HotMap.com. Although we experienced some attrition during the course of the four-week study, the results indicate that many of the features of the system are beneficial and useful in real-world use. Although exploratory search comprised a small portion of the total search activities undertaken, the features of the HotMap.com which support query refinement and search results exploration did not interfere with the more common targeted searching tasks. As a result, most participants indicated that they found the system useful and easy to use.

Changing the View: Towards the Theory of Visualisation Comprehension
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
The core problem of the evaluation of information visualisation is that the end product of visualisation - the comprehension of the information from the data - is difficult to measure objectively. This paper outlines a description of visualisation comprehension based on two existing theories of perception: principles of perceptual organisation and the reverse hierarchy theory. The resulting account of the processes involved in visualisation comprehension enables evaluation that is not only objective, but also non-comparative, providing an absolute efficiency classification. Finally, as a sample application of this approach, an experiment studying the benefits of interactivity in 3D scatterplots is presented.

In recent years, numerous visual Web search interfaces have been developed in the research community. However, the user evaluations of these interfaces have been performed using a wide range of methods, making it difficult to compare and verify the relative value of the proposed advancements. In this paper, we survey these evaluation methods, and propose a stepped evaluation and refinement model for the systematic study and enhancement of visual Web search interfaces. We suggest that this stepped model can be generalized to support the evaluation of other information visualization systems that target exploratory or knowledge-centric domains.

Document interpretation is a crucial task in many visual analytics applications, made harder by the widespread availability of freely available textual files. In this paper we propose an approach based on topic detection coupled with multiple coordinated views to assist analysis of time varying document collections. Given multiple document maps built from a set of text files, we define a strategy to support users locating the evolution of topics addressed by the documents, along various time steps. The approach is supported by a new algorithm for topic extraction from texts, also introduced. Finally, we show several examples illustrating how the proposed strategy may be applied in the analysis of document collections.

Re-finding previously viewed Web pages in browsing histories is often a difficult task, due to the incomplete and vague knowledge people have about the information they are seeking. In this paper, we present a visual interface for the task of re-finding Web pages within browsing histories. BrowseLine employs a novel two-dimensional timeline metaphor, allowing users to visually identify temporal patterns within their browsing histories. These visual patterns can be matched to the users' recollection of their browsing activities, allowing them to jump to a time interval in their browsing history for further investigation. Preliminary evaluations of BrowseLine have found that users can readily grasp the two-dimensional timeline representation, and can use the system effectively to re-find previously viewed pages.

2009
The aim of our research is to provide an application framework for end-users, who do not have enough programming skills, to dynamically generate applications using interactive, coordinated, multiple 3D visualization techniques. In our framework, each 3D application for visualization is constructed by users themselves or already exists, and consists of sets of interactive 3D components. Users can embed such 3D applications into cells on Excel, and define the coordination between them. To define coordination, we provide interactive 2D/3D components and coordination rules that enable users to use operations for coordination such as brushing and linking, retrieving related or detailed information one after another, synchronizing viewpoints between 3D visualizations, and sharing table values between 3D components for visualizations and cells on Excel.

The MOST bus is a current bus technology for connecting multimedia components in cars, such as radios, navigation systems, or media players. The bus functionality is described in a large hierarchically structured catalog of some 4psila000 entries. Browsing this catalog has become infeasible on paper as well as with currently used textual database interfaces. An observation of current work practices has revealed many problems and inefficiencies. We describe the (iteratively developed) design of MostVis, a visual tool for exploring MOST function catalogs, as well as an evaluation of our implemented prototype. Our design carefully adapts existing visualization techniques and combines them in a multiple coordinated view (MCV) approach to satisfy the specific needs of our target group. With this paper, we hope to provide a living example of how existing general-purpose techniques can be successfully trimmed and tailored for a very specific audience.

Enhanced Star Glyphs for Multiple-Source Data Analysis
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
The analysis of large sums of data can be extremely difficult to perform if the data is not presented graphically. As a result, many graphing techniques have been developed, such as scatter plots, histograms. Generally, the main purpose of graphically displaying data is to do one of two things: First, to find the general average of where most of the data lies. Second, to find the outliers, the data points that are most distant from the others. Our visualization will attempt to find both by using a multitude of common graphing techniques to expand upon the traditional star glyph and create a new way of graphing data. These techniques include clustering, using color as identifiers, and 3D graphing capabilities to present more data that would not be possible of being shown in a two dimensional environment. We apply our techniques to compare several air traffic trajectory predictors currently being analyzed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.

Apart from being useful for readers and participants of these forums, the interactive capabilities of our system makes it appealing for social researchers interested in understanding the phenomena and intrinsic structure of online conversations. We also show a use case where we applied the tool to visualize discussions from Slashdot.org, showing its capabilities to represent new, in this case Slashdot specific, metrics. The visual representation of discussion threads has arisen as a complement for supporting investigation,as it helps to understand such large amount of information and contributes to the generation of new research ideas.

A Visualization Approach for Frauds Detection in Financial Market
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation

2009
The traditional solutions to the stock market security are not sufficient in identifying attackers and further attack plans from the analysis of existing events.Therefore, it is difficult for analysts to prevent future unexpected events or frauds by only monitoring the realtime trading information. The event-driven fraud detection in financial market could not help analysts to find attack plans and the further intention of attackers. This paper proposed a new framework of visual analytics for stock market security. The proposed solution consists of two stages: 1) visual surveillance of market performance, and 2) behavior-driven visual analysis of trading networks.In the first stage, we use a 3D treemaps to monitor the real-time stock market performance and to identify a particular stock that produced an unusual trading pattern. We then move to the next stage: social network visualization to conduct behavior-driven visual analysis of suspected pattern. Through the visual analysis of social (or trading)network, analysts may finally identify the attackers (the sources of the fraud), and further attack plans.

The complex nature of multivariate data sets calls for high interactive performance and intuitive metaphors. A specific type of multivariate data is where the variables sum up to a constant, here defined as multicomponent data. This application paper presents an interactive application for analysis of modeled multicomponent data. The aim is to find high performance variable combinations that fulfill some requested properties. The application is based on coordinated views that include parallel coordinates, a ternary diagram, a 2D scatter plot and a line plot. It supports numerous interaction techniques enabling fast analysis of complex patterns in multicomponent data sets. The application is developed in collaboration with researchers within the fields of statistics and chemistry. An informal usability evaluation indicates that the interactive nature of the application clearly facilitates the analysis process.

Recent advances in mobile device technology have opened up new possibilities in enhancing the experience of spectators at stadium-based sporting events. In creating novel applications for use in such settings, designers must be aware of the current practices of spectators and of features of the environment at such events that novel applications may seek to exploit. This work forms an early part of the Designing the Augmented Stadium project. Data sets have been collected from spectators, logging the results of Bluetooth scans alongside GPS location. This paper presents an information visualization tool that can be used in the analysis and exploration of this data, to provide insight into the activities of spectators, the relationship between an individual spectator and the crowd as a whole and the suitability of stadium environments for applications based on infrastructure such as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and wireless mesh networking. Various visualization tools are described and example cases are illustrated, using several real-world data sets recorded at football matches.

Smart environments consist of several interconnected devices. The device ensemble can change dynamically as mobile devices enter or leave the environment. To utilize such environments efficiently for information visualization, we propose a service-oriented architecture.Various services run on different machines and visualizations are generated dynamically depending on the environment's current situation. The necessary adaptation to available output devices is driven by instantiation of different service implementations, by parameterizing service invocations, and by adapting the visualization pipeline at run-time. We implemented a prototype that provides parallel coordinates, scatter plot matrices, and a map display.

Chronos: A Tool for Interactive Scheduling and Visualisation of Task Hierarchies
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Visualisation and structuring of tasks in a schedule, from relatively simple activities such as meeting scheduling to more complex ones such as project planning, has been traditionally supported by timeline representations similar to Gantt charts. Despite their popularity, Gantt charts suffer from a number of shortcomings, including poor representation of detail and inefficient use of screen real-estate, particularly when a large number of parallel tasks, each of which requiring its own representation space, need to be displayed. We have devised an alternative visualisation, called temporal mosaic, which addresses some of these shortcomings while utilising space more efficiently. We have shown that as a static visualisation temporal mosaics outperform Gantt charts in terms of their ability to convey time-based scheduling information to users engaged in various temporal inference tasks. This paper extends that research by presenting interactive techniques which support creation, and dynamic visualisation of task hierarchies and relationships. These techniques are illustrated through a system for direct manipulation of schedules in both Gantt chart and temporal mosaic formats.

New GAIA Visualization Methods

In this paper, we consider multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) problems. GAIA is a descriptive extension of the PROMETHEE methods. It provides the decision maker with a two dimensional graphical representation of the multicriteria problem. A limit of the GAIA method is the loss of information resulting from the underlying principal components analysis that can result in inconsistencies with the PROMETHEE rankings. The aim of this paper is to address this limit by introducing new complementary GAIA-type visual representations. At first we introduce the context and briefly recall the principles of the PROMETHEE methods. We then introduce the GAIA method and propose two new extensions: GAIA-Stick gives a better view of the PROMETHEE ranking, while GAIA-Criterion enables the decision maker to focus on one specific criterion. Finally, a numerical example is used to illustrate the completed GAIA approach and to show how it can improve the decision process.

Visual Analysis of Mutual Fund Performance

Mutual funds are probably the most important investment instruments for investors. Their performance is mainly affected by their characteristics, such as asset size, turnover and fee structure. It is thus of the investors' highest priorities to understand the relation between fund performance and these properties. Typically, financial researchers use the linear regression technique to statistically assess the relation from massive fund performance data. Unfortunately, the prevailing methods may be confounded by the existence of on-linearity and outliers, and give conflicting conclusions. In this paper, we propose a visualization-based method to improve the mutual fund analysis, where a new visual analytical tool, the density-based distribution map, is applied. The new visual representations greatly help to understand the critical relations, reveal the deficiency of current analytical algorithms, and support mutual funds selection. The tool is used to perform an expert financial analysis, and establish a fund selection strategy from a real-world database of the US stock funds. Our method gains the admiration and support from professionals in the finance field, they embrace it as a potential investment analysis tool for mutual fund managers, financial planners, and investors.

Although there have been effective visualizations for simplex continuous or categorical variables, mixed data sets are still difficult to visualize, since no direct approaches are available for them. This paper presents a memory-saving and efficient data transformation technique for mixed data sets visualization,particularly details on describing the application of Correspondence Analysis to quantify categorical variables, and proposes a set of cardinality reduction strategies to reduce the numbers of variables and their values involved in computations. A series of empirical studies are carried out in a Star Coordinates-based environment to evaluate the visualization of mixed datasets. Finally it is concluded that the visualization gives a good graphical view of mixed data sets, with the data transformation technique being efficient in both time and memory.

Currently, many visualization methods are used in computer assisted medicine. It is commonly considered that a unique visualization scheme makes difficult the interaction and limits the quality and quantity of the information shown. In this paper we study the specific requirements of a maxillofacial surgery simulation tool for facial appearance prediction. The different stages of the application lead to present medical information in different ways. We propose to adapt visualization techniques to give a more suitable answer to these needs: a hybrid volumetric and polygonal visualization for the planning stage, as well as a scheme for surgery definition in 2D. Finally, we propose the use of mesh visualization for the simulated model, which previously requires the 3D reconstruction of the surface in order to be visualized.

It starts with an overview of existing ontology visualization methods; afterwards it describes the Semantic DB system and the OWLeasyViz ontology editor. Semantic DB is a web application framework to create simple complete semantic web applications, integrating an ontology editor, a resource editor, an inference rule editor, a reasoner, and a search engine. OWLeasyViz is an ontology editor that combines a textual and a graphical representation of OWL ontologies. It meets different user needs by providing a simple and intuitive interface to end-users who are not ontologists, and offering more advanced tools to ontology experts. The OWLeasyViz editor is intended to be a module of a semantic web integrated working environment, developed within the context of a Swiss Government funded CTI applied research project in the domain of waste water management.

Visual Representation of Reifications in RDF Visualizer
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
One family of visualization tools for the semantic Web are those that directly display the underlying RDF data. Most of them use the inherent graph structure of RDF data and present the user with some drawing of the graph. While it is usually sufficient to give the user with decent understanding of data, there are some features of RDF that could be used to improve the visualization, for instance the presence of reifications. While they can easily be displayed just like any other part of the RDF graph, their specific properties allow for more advanced processing.

Document Visualization Based on Semantic Graphs
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
In this paper, we present a document visualization technique for data analysis based on the semantic representation of text in the form of a directed graph, referred to as semantic graph. It is derived using natural language processing as follows. Firstly subject- verb-object triplets are automatically extracted from the Penn Treebank parse tree obtained for each sentence in the document. Secondly, the triplets are further enhanced by linking them to their corresponding co-referenced named entity, by resolving pronominal anaphors as well as attaching the associated WordNet synset. Starting from the document's semantic graph and the list of extracted triplets we automatically generate the document summary, for which we also derive the semantic representation.

2009
Biological pathways are key to the existence of all life forms. They illustrate how organisms can take one or more molecules and utilize them in such a way that yields products which can be crucial to it sustaining life. It is rare that these are one or two step procedures or very linear mechanisms. Typically, pathways are multi-stepped occurrences with many key intermediates. This complexity can make them difficult to read and properly understand. We present a system in which we store and utilize pathway data to programmatically create user-friendly and informative visualizations.

Visualizing Fuzzy Clusters Using RadViz
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Clustering techniques are heuristic processes that typically do not yield one optimal solution. Therefore it is common practice to generate multiple cluster sets and investigate the consistency of the record groupings. Fuzzy clustering essentially achieves the same objective by providing a measure of the extent to which each record belongs to each cluster i.e. the strength of association of each record to each cluster. This paper develops a visualization of fuzzy clustering using RadViz, compares it to a Vectorized RadViz visualization of the results of multiple cluster ensembles and then applies it to a microarray dataset.

Visualizing Temporal Dynamics at the Genomic and Metabolic Level
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
We present an application for integrated visualization of gene expression data from time series experiments in gene regulation networks and metabolic networks. Such integration is necessary, since it provides the link between the measurements at the transcriptional level and the observable characteristics of an organism at the functional level. Our application can (i) visualize the data from time series experiments in the context of a regulatory network and a metabolic network; (ii) identify and visualize active regulatory subnetworks from the gene expression data; (iii) perform a statistical test to identify and subsequently visualize affected metabolic subnetworks. Initial results show that our integrated approach speeds up data analysis, and that it can reproduce results of a traditional approach that involves many manual and time-consuming steps.

This paper presents a visual data mining approach using the combination of clinical data, pathways and gene-expression data. The visual exploration of medical data using pathways to navigate and filter the data allows a more systematic and efficient investigation of problems in modern life science. A multiplicity of hypothesis can be evaluated in the same period of time, enabling a much better exploitation of the data. We present a system for data preprocessing and automatic classification, a set of visualization views and finally the integration in the Caleydo visualization framework, which enables the ldquocouplingrdquo of genetic and a broad spectrum of clinical data. With the help of the Caleydo framework the medical expert can identify connections between genetic parameters, patient subgroups, and drug responses.

None
2009
Information synthesis is a key portion of the analysis process with visual analytics tools. This stage of work requires users to collect, organize, and add meaning to individual analytical results. This paper reports the results of a needs assessment study with technical and bio/chemical security analysts intended to characterize the ways in which users currently synthesize information,and to elicit ideas for future tools to support information synthesis. Our work used structured interviews to obtain knowledge from analysts. Responses indicate that synthesis is currently supported through the use of office productivity software, and current tools do not provide adequate support for the task of information synthesis.

Knowledge discovery involves data driven processes where data is transformed and processed by various algorithms to identify new knowledge. KnowMiner is a service oriented framework providing a rich set of knowledge discovery functionalities with focus on text data sets. Complementing results of automatic machine analysis with the immense processing power of human visual apparatus has the potential of significantly improving the process of acquiring new knowledge. VisTools is a lightweight visual analytics framework based on multiple coordinated views (MCV) paradigm designed for deployment atop the KnowMinerpsilas service architecture. In this paper we briefly present both frameworks and, driven by real-world customer requirements, describe how visual techniques can be synergistically combined with machine processing for effective analysis of dynamically changing, metadata-rich text documents sets.

This paper focus on the development of a tool for Ship and Weather Information Monitoring (SWIM) visualizing weather data combined with data from ship voyages. The project was done in close collaboration with the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) who also evaluated the result. The goal was to implement a tool which will help shipping companies to monitor their fleet and the weather development along planned routes and provide support for decisions regarding route choice and to evade hazard. A qualitative usability study was performed to gather insight about usability issues and to aid future development. Overall the result of the study was positive and the users felt that the tool would aid them in the daily work.

Dynamic Mapping of Raster-Data for 3D Geovirtual Environments
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Interactive 3D geovirtual environments (GeoVE), such as 3D virtual city and landscape models, are important tools to communicate geo-spatial information. Usually, this includes static polygonal data (e.g., digital terrain model) and raster data (e.g., aerial images) which are composed from multiple data sources during a complex, only partial automatic pre-processing step. When dealing with highly dynamic geo-referenced raster data, such as the propagation of fires or floods, this pre-processing step hinders the direct application of 3D GeoVE for decision support systems. To compensate for this limitation, this paper presents a concept for dynamically mapping multiple layers of raster for interactive GeoVE. The implementation of our rendering technique is based on the concept of projective texture mapping and can be implemented efficiently using consumer graphics hardware. Further, this paper demonstrates the flexibility of our technique using a number of typical application examples.

GAIA Map: A Tool for Visual Ranking Analysis in Spatial Multicriteria Problems
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Spatial multicriteria decision problems are decision problems where one needs to take multiple conflicting criteria as well as geographical knowledge into account. In such a context, exploratory spatial analysis is known to provide tools to visualize as much data as possible on maps but does not integrate multicriteria aspects. Also, none of the tools provided by multicriteria analysis were initially destined to be used in a geographical context.In this paper, we propose an application of the PROMETHEE and GAIA ranking methods to Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The aim is to help decision makers obtain rankings of geographical entities and understand why such rankings have been obtained. To do that, we make use of the visual approach of the GAIA method and adapt it to display the results on geographical maps. This approach is then extended to cover several weaknesses of the adaptation. Finally, it is applied to a study of the region of Brussels as well as an evaluation of the Human Development Index (HDI) in Europe.

An emerging and challenging Geovisual Analytics application domain is visualization of hierarchical regional (sub-national) statistics. The OECD regional database is a potential treasure chest for policy-makers, researchers and citizens to gain a better understanding of a regionpsilas structure and performance and to carry out analysis of territorial trends and disparities based on sound information comparable across countries. New methods are needed to visually make comparisons between groups on different hierarchical levels, such as cities with countries or parts of countries. In this context, we demonstrate and reflect upon the potential synergy between information and geovisualization through the use of a squarified treemap dynamically linked to a choropleth map to facilitate visualization of complex hierarchical social science data. We exemplify and evaluate our approach with three usage scenarios that explore population change in the OECD countries using 1) squarified treemap, 2) regional choropleth map and 3) combined treemap and choropleth map.

None
2009
This paper presents a social network modeling technique that models the data to be analyzed to create a social network as frequent closed patterns. Frequent closed patterns have the advantage that they successfully grab the inherent information content of the dataset and is applicable to a broader application domain. Entropies of the frequent closed patterns are used to keep the dimensionality of the feature vectors to a reasonable size. Experimental results presented in the paper shows that social network produced from these set of features successfully carries the community structure information.

The semantic Web has been evolved as a key technology, bringing new insights and solutions to well documented problems in e-learning. The research field of semantic e-learning covers a wide range of research problems. In this paper, we present an approach to visualize an ontology driven information retrieval system in the context of E-learning. This approach has been implemented on the HyperManyMedia platform, and is already being used by online students at WKU. The design of this work is based on the following steps: (1) presenting the HyperManyMedia domain as a tree consisting of concepts and subconcepts where the leaves are the documents (lectures), (2) embedding Nutch search engine into the platform, (3) reconfiguring Nutch search engine to accommodate the semantic search, (4) using Prefuse as a visual tool to present the ontology as a graph, and (5) embedding the graph into the platform as an applet so that learners can navigate visually through the ontology of the domain by clicking on nodes.

2009
The revolution in information technology is making open sources more accessible, ubiquitous, and valuable. The International Intelligence Communities have seen open sources grow increasingly easier and cheaper to acquire in recent years. Up to 80% of electronic data is textual and most valuable information is often encoded in pages which are neither structured, nor classified. The process of accessing all these raw data, heterogeneous for language used, and transforming them into information is therefore inextricably linked to the concepts of textual analysis and synthesis, hinging greatly on the ability to master the problems of multilinguality. This paper describes SYNTHEMA SPYWatch, a content enabling system for OSINT,which has been adopted by some Intelligence operative structures in Italy to support the collection,processing, exploitation, production, dissemination and evaluation cycle. By this system, operative officers can get an overview of great volumes of textual data,which helps them discover meaningful similarities among documents and find all related information.

nCompass is a flexible, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) designed to support the research and deployment of advanced tacit collaboration technology services for analysts. nCompass allows a significantly larger number of individual analytic capabilities, applications and services to be integrated together quickly and effectively. Service integration results are described from several computational tacit collaboration experiments conducted with open source intelligence analysts working with open source data. Key to nCompass is the technical framework and unique analytic event logging schema that supports context sharing across diverse applications and services. It is by combining the analyst with shared context across multiple advanced computational capabilities in a system of systems that a breakthrough in collaborative open source analysis can be achieved. This paper introduces the nCompass framework and integration platform, describes key nCompass core services, and provides results on functional synergies achieved through technology service integration with nCompass.

Law enforcement officers deal with various challenges regarding the management of information during an investigation. New information comes in frequently, some of it is uncertain, incorrect, or incomplete. Officers should be supported in developing interpretations of the provided information. Furthermore, it is beneficial (and demanded by some investigation methodologies) to record the progression of the analysis. In order to fulfill these requirements, we propose a spatial hypertext-based application, as part of an open framework. This enhances collaborative work on uncertain, incomplete, and frequently changing information structures and provides access to other applications used in investigations.

2009
Research in the area of privacy preserving techniques in databases and subsequently in data mining concepts have witnessed an explosive growth-spurt in recent years. This work investigates the problem of privacy-preserving mining of frequent sequential patterns over progressive databases. We propose a procedure to protect the privacy of data by adding noisy items to each transaction. The experimental results indicate that this method can achieve a rather high level of accuracy. The method is applied on an existing algorithm PISA for frequent pattern mining. This algorithm works on both static and dynamically increasing databases, and thereby takes full advantage of their applicability of the module.

Distributed Web-based applications have been progressively increasing in number and scale over the past decades. There is an intensification of the need for security frameworks in the era of Web-based applications when we refer to distributed telemedicine interoperability architectures. In contrast, service oriented architecture (SOA) is gaining popularity day by day when we specially consider the Web applications. SOA is playing a major role to maintain the security standards of distributed applications. This paper proposes a secure Web-based architectural design by using the standards of SOA for distributed Web application that maintains the interoperability and data integration through certain secure channels. We have created CRUD (Create,Read, Update, Delete) operations that has an implication on our own created web services and we propose a secure architecture that is implemented on CRUD operations.

This article discusses three tools that allow making collaboration and decision-making more effective. It presents insights from working in the ldquoETH Baugarten Value Labrdquo, a new research space with five touch displays. First, the article introduces this lab. Then, it introduces two software tools to support communication and group decision-making. The first tool is targeted at urban planners, the second at managers. We found that (1) the lab fascinates and engages the users, (2) that not many software tools are available for such a setting and that those tools are not very user friendly, (3) that people underestimate the time to design suitable workshops. We have found in various workshops that our two tools seem to go in the right direction, which states that ldquoless functionality is morerdquo.

Beyond Knowledge Visualization Usability: Toward a Better Understanding of Business Diagram Adoption
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Information visualization research typically focuses on the formal aspects of specific graphic solutions in terms of their thinking and/or communication support. This type of analysis often focuses on quantitative diagrams and emphasizes their attributes for specific tasks. Our contribution, by contrast, focuses on qualitative visual solutions and the factors that contribute to their wider diffusion. As many knowledge visualization solutions have not achieved wider use, the question of which factors foster diagram adoption seems to be a particularly relevant but under- researched topic. In this paper we develop and discuss three dimensions that foster knowledge visualization adoption: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived authority. We base our analysis on the Technology Adoption Model by Davis and the Perceived Characteristics of Innovations by Rogers. We illustrate these dimensions and their items through examples of business diagrams that have received wide recognition and we contrast them with negative examples.

This paper is the third in a series of papers designed to explore how "metaphorical meaning" can be used to support knowledge visualization. Within the present discussion the following is assumed: To understand the process of mind and organizational performance a view on meaningful expression is needed. In order to approach this collaborative task, knowledge visualization is seen as "business analysis" and the concepts of metaphor and media are seen as a carrier of meaning. This is meant to provide a better understanding of the visualization of knowledge for necessary alignment in business analysis.

2009
This paper presents 'The Sensitive Tapestry', an interactive installation using body-input as a nontraditional user interface. The technical basis for this kind of media-enabled environment is a thermal imager that captures the activities in public areas at a large scale. The installation has been developed as a prototypical example in architectural education at the ETH Zurich, Science City. The aim of the project is to generate a novel experience, which shows the potential of merging physical architecture and digital information. The article newly develops architecture as an interface that reveals information about the building itself, its occupants, and/or its environment. It describes the research that employs design experimentation and information visualization with the use of computer supported,interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition. This questions the way in which one perceives the own body spatiality and motility in physical and augmented environments and how the particular experience created by this juxtaposition evokes onepsilas awareness of the motility in the public. The paper suggests that introducing this kind of display in asocial scenario can enrich the casual interaction of people nearby and this might enhance social awareness and engagement.

A Novel Visualization Approach for Data-Mining-Related Classification
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Classification and categorization are common tasks in data mining and knowledge discovery. Visualizations of classification models can create understanding and trust in data mining models. However, existing visualizations are often complex or restricted to specific classifiers and attributes. In this work, we propose an intuitive visualization system to observe and understand classification processes and results. Our system can handle multiple classes, nominal and numeric attributes, and supports all classifiers whose predictions can be interpreted as probabilities. We state that the possibility to observe the training process of a classifier boosts the understanding of classification results also for non-expert users. In combination with an intuitive visualization, we provide a system to generate in-depth understanding of classification processes and results. Our simulations revealed that the system could support the user to better understand a classifier's decision, and to gain insights into classification processes.

Most of us can recognize common 3D objects depicted in drawings, photographs and computer graphics. But, few of us are able to manually reproduce them in a convincing manner. This paper discusses a psychology experiment that investigates the variability in individual drawing ability and the ability to read 3D images. Currently, Shepard and Metzlerpsilas Mental Rotation Test is the most popular test for spatial ability. This paper discusses the need to further investigate the correlation of 3D drawing ability and recognition and its potential effect on the legibility of the 3D information visualization application. This paper reports ongoing research in this field.

Visualizing Contextual Information of Cocitation Networks
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Visualizing a cocitation network is an important technique employed by information scientists to illustrate the intellectual structure of a knowledge domain. A cocitation network is usually visualized by drawing an undirected arc between two articles that are cocited by other papers. The contextual information, i.e., information regarding papers citing these cocited articles, is suppressed and therefore invisible. We demonstrate a novel approach that uses the citation network itself to reveal cocitation relationships. The preserved contextual information of the cocitation network reveals the indirect relationships between clusters of cocited nodes that may facilitate the exploration of interdisciplinary studies.

How can the prestige of research centres forming part of scientific co-authorship networks focused on physiology and pharmacology be measured? This paper attempts to answer that question on the basis of a bibliometric analysis of Spanish scientific production in these areas of research between 1995 and 2005 as listed in Thomson Reuterspsila science citation index expanded. An affinity index is used to measure the asymmetric co-authorship relationships between any two institutions on the collaboration network to obtain the hub and authority values for the leading institutions. The spatial distribution of network nodes is mapped with the Kamada Kwai algorithm. The findings identify the centres of greatest prestige from the standpoint of co-authorship of scientific papers.

Scouting Requirements Quality Using Visual Representations
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Examining the quality of a set of requirements is a sensible project health check given their role in the engineering of quality software systems. However, not all project stakeholders may recognize the value of requirements audits or inspections, and scrutinizing the details of a requirements document can be perceived to be too time-consuming, distracting and costly an activity to undertake early on in a project. We suggest that a major benefit of any such review activity is the discussion that is triggered amongst stakeholders about the artifact under consideration, in this case the requirements document, and that more cursory approaches may yield some of this value and be more appealing so as to encourage this actual practice. In particular, we propose that a visualization of an emerging requirements document could be generated as a vehicle for preliminary review, in advance of more concerted efforts directed towards finding defects in the predominantly text-based artifact itself. We call this initial review activity dasiascoutingpsila, provide heuristics to support it and evaluate the potential of Wordles as a candidate visual representation. This work hence proposes applying a pre-existing visualization technique to an important problem area in software engineering.

Geolocating and Georeferencing: GIS Tools for Ancient Maps Visualisation
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
The e-library on ancient Spanish cartography has been created inside the frame set by the European Union about the Europepsilas digital cultural heritage to give a response to the real demand among citizens and within the research community. With this aim we have applied the most advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs) to make ancient Spanish maps and views accessible through Internet. On a first stage we have built a relational multiformat and multilingual database that included high resolution images of the cartographic documents and that supported the online accessibility structured by levels. This platform has been recently improved by implementing an open GIS based on the data sets of the e-library. GIS tools have enlarged the usability of the system as the traditional geolocation searches are now completed with the queries based on mapspsila georeferencing. The GIS on ancient Spanish maps suggests a new concept in digital map libraries.

"Seeing Mardayin': Instability and Ambiguity in the Art of John Mawurndjul, Kuninjku, Arnhem Land, Northern Australia
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
According to the 'Yolngu' and 'Kuninjku' peoples of Arnhem Land, northern Australia their art connects knowledge to the land. Land comes into being as a part of an ancestral dreaming enacted through performative storytelling. In this region a particular technique for revealing elements of nature is used called 'rarrk'. The technique employs a crosshatched layering of coloured lines. The surface of these images present a powerful but ambiguous visual and emotional effect on the viewer. It creates a dialogue not ordinarily possible with more traditional flattened or chiaroscuro techniques. Similar yet distinct from the more familiar moire effects of the early twentieth century European Impressionists, the technique is a peculiarly potent method for communicating a local cultural heritage knowledge to those initiated in its conventions. The work of a local Aboriginal artist who specializes in rarrk, Mawurndjul, is explored as a case study in the stability and ambiguity of the images generated using this technique. The paper explores the technique, its use and effectiveness and suggests it as a cultural heritage knowledge communication schema, highlighting the plethora of schemas yet to be explored in cultural heritage knowledge visualisation in general.

Regeneration of the Traditional Folding Screen as Media Art

2009
In recent decades, rapid progress in technology and changes in media environment have made it possible to convey works of art to the masses, even if it is hard to preserve the meaning of an original work of artpsilas conception. Such problems have occurred particularly with respect to several Asian nations whose works of art have a long history,since they cause concern among lovers of such artworks as to whether or not they are willing to give up the meaning of their entire culture. Japan is among the forefront of such nations, and is going through a period of trouble on whether it should give up its unique styles of art as a result of changes in life-style. Consequently, Japan is taking pains to determine how to preserve its cultural traditions while at the same time taking steps in the right direction to take its place as one of the member nations of modern society. In our research work we have attempted to graft traditional art and culture onto the new concept of media technology to enlarge the field of media art and to expresses works of art in the form of products that can be used in day-to-day life, not simply as simple pieces of work in which mass media has no interest. We also attempted to find ways to adopt art works to media and to this day and age, escaping out-of-date techniques or artisanpsilas skills that remain useable today. We not only show the techniques involved in creating works of art but also analyze how the media's re-analysis of traditional art and culture affects the public and makes it reassess the meanings of works of art.

The Need for a Reconciliation Pedagogy: Educating for a More Holistic, Shared Australian Cultural Heritage
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Reconciliation is the process of reconciling differences, whether they be historical misrepresentations of cultural identity or any other site of dissonance. In the Australian context, the role of media in portraying indigenous persons and non-indigenous alike has been to marginalise indigenous history in favour of a predominantly white history. A dasiareconciliation pedagogypsila aims to educate for a more holistic, shared Australian cultural heritage. The key issues are: nationalism, racialisation and reconciliation. This paper addresses the need for a reconciliation pedagogy, providing an overview of the issues raised and an outline for a tool for use as a teaching aid. This is a position paper exploring the potential of role plays to teach reconciliation in Australia. It proposes that a transformative education emerges through role play triggering empathy and raising questions about indigenous cultural heritage. The relationship between games and learning is well known (Hubbard, 1980). It is through supervised role play games that we feel a more holistic shared, reconciliatory cultural heritage knowledge can be shaped. This paper concludes with some recommendations for the implementation of a more inclusive reconciliation pedagogy.

Murals are the important components of culture and arts of Tibet. Tibet's murals are mainly painted on the walls of temples, palaces and homes. Unhappily, these murals have been ruined or are being ruined by some diseases such as cracking, hollowing, falling off, fluid erosion, dirt, and so on. It is necessary to use new technologies to protect murals. June 2007, we, from Capital Normal University and National Institute of Cultural Property collected a lot of laser range images and digital images of Tibetpsilas murals. We proposed that integrating range data and image data to investigate mural diseases and give the location, length and area of mural diseases. Moreover, we also presented a parallel computing method to process the huge range data, and discussed to align the images into a big image based on SIFT.

This paper proposes methods of visualizing the personal promotion records of Japanese government officials in medieval times. Our research is aimed at developing multiple visualization tools that facilitate discovery of exceptional promotions as a way of highlighting interesting or important factors behind historical events, or that enable comparison of various promotion patterns to aid in understanding the political background the period. We have developed the following tools for visualizing personal promotion records:(i) the personal promotion graph (PPG-I) enables visualization of the promotional transition of court nobles in medieval Japan, and (ii) the promotion pattern graph (PPG-II) shows various promotion patterns that help reveal typical patterns of promotion for court nobles in relation to a particular period or family. There are many techniques for visualizing data in different ways. These tools provide variations in viewpoints for analyzing the political background of the era and help trigger consideration of different scenarios.

2009
Aesthetics is an unsolved problem of information visualization, because there is no satisfactory understanding of what constitutes aesthetic effect. This survey paper gives an overview of approaches to model aesthetics, starting with Birkhoffpsilas aesthetic measure and continuing to recent ones based on mathematical and information theoretical concepts. Common concepts in the different models are highlighted, such as the effects of order and complexity. Further, practical techniques for generating aesthetic visualizations are shown together with examples of recent work in this field. Finally, the paper discusses some of the key issues regarding aesthetics and the human factor in the visualization process. Empirical studies have shown a correlation between perceived aesthetics and usability, meaning that a better understanding of aesthetics could improve the usability of visualizations.

Towards an Aesthetic Dimensions Framework for Dynamic Graph Visualisations
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
Most research on the readability of graph visualization focuses on node-link diagrams of static graphs. But in many applications graphs are not static, but change over time, or graphs are too dense to be drawn as node-link diagrams. In this paper we look at dynamic graph visualizations: We translate the general goal of graph visualization-to convey the underlying information of a graph-into aesthetic dimensions that are applicable in practice. These aesthetic dimensions help to design, compare, and evaluate dynamic graph visualizations.

Dynamics, movement, kinetics, animation: so many names for an area so frequently ignored in graphics. Ephemeral by nature, such transient devices are frequently ignored over the concrete and contextual. Yet the screen has become the primary source for accessing information and is ubiquitous in urban advertising, stimulating graphics increasingly to include dynamics and visual momentum in their design. This paper seeks to reappraise the application of dynamics for representation and appeal, drawing on implied dynamics in static images, dynamics within the frame and dynamic editing. Using illustrative examples this paper discusses whether a commonality of kinetic perception in dynamics can be relied upon for engagement and appeal, and offers a new conceptual model for event perception, drawing on cognitive psychology, montage theory and eye tracking technology. The paper posits that motion is a primary perceptual form and that its application in visualization boosts gestalt comprehension.

We present several innovative interaction techniques for 3D target acquisition and indication. These techniques make use of the shape of our cylindrical multi-touch interface, which we are developing as an interface for a volumetric display. Our interaction techniques are used to control a spherical cursor in 3D space. Notably, our techniques use a two-handed operation in which the position and size of the area touched is mapped directly to the position and size of the spherical cursor. This mapping can instantly determine the 4DOF of the spherical cursor, i.e., its 3D coordinates and its radius, and thus allows rapid 3D target acquisition and indication.

Being motivated by the need for usable Web security systems, we present in this paper new image-based CAPTCHA systems that overcome the weaknesses of commercial CAPTCHAs. We describe Tree and Shape CAPTCHAs in addition to handwritten CAPTCHAs that feature visual objects transformed according to specific principles of cognitive psychology. These transformations, in addition to other security measures we describe, ensure that our CAPTCHAs are easily interpretable by humans but not by machines. We seek not only to provide useful CAPTCHAs, but to offer important insights into such fields as Information Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, etc. Early testing results indicate that users find our CAPTCHAs an attractive alternative to text-based CAPTCHAs and are readily able to solve them based on cognitive abilities. Conversely, machine recognition is low due to the current inability to make use of these cognitive aids, thus making our CAPTCHAs a viable solution for cyber security.

Understanding Web navigational data is a crucial task for Web analysts as it may influence the Web site improvement process. However, major Web analytics tools do not provide enough insight, taking into account the vast amount of data available in Web serverspsila log files. Moreover, some analysts argue that those tools have a lack of rich visualisations that enable the exploration of such data. In this paper we introduce new techniques applied to a highly interactive and exploratory tool, to allow drilling down through Web usage data. The system uses a set of coordinated visual abstractions from Web site structure and userspsila navigation to provide different perspectives and hence, to assist the conversion of data into knowledge.

2009
Mobile Web search engines represent retrieved results using primarily text based result surrogates. Users could benefit from information visualization techniques that provide more information about the results as basis of relevance judgments. We present a query-biased visualization approach that incorporates query occurrence visualization into the conventional mobile Web search interface. Textual and graphical versions of the design were evaluated in a study with 18 users. Eleven of the participants preferred either one of the visualizations to the traditional search interface. The results suggest that the key benefit of the proposed visualization is its unobtrusiveness. It does not distract from normal use yet when necessary it can be used to help with relevance assessment, for example when the search engine fails to provide good result descriptors.However, the utility of the proposed query occurrence visualization is dependent on how well it matches the user's mental model and existing search strategies.

Concepts maps are a useful method for visualizing how concepts are associated within a domain. Automated tools can extract the key concepts from a corpus and display their relationships in a two-dimensional representation. However, it may be difficult to quickly perceive the overall structure of a concept map. The aim of this research is to provide a framework on a concept map to identify primary concepts and nearby, related concepts providing context for them using network graph techniques. Automated concept maps are usually very highly connected, and full connectivity shows none of the detail or fine structure. Minimum spanning trees based on the strength of the co-occurrence frequency between concepts and their relative distances on the two-dimensional concept map show hierarchical structure, with key concepts acting as hubs within the network structure. The links within the minimum spanning tree can be used to associate concepts that are not directly connected.

Some Results for Drawing Area Proportional Venn3 With Convex Curves
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation

2009
Many data sets are visualized effectively with area proportional Venn diagrams, where the area of the regions is in proportion to a defined specification. In particular, Venn diagrams with three intersecting curves are considered useful for visualizing data in many applications, including bioscience, ecology and medicine. To ease the understanding of such diagrams,using restricted dasianicepsila shapes for the curves is considered beneficial. Many research questions on the use of such diagrams are still open. For instance, a general solution to the question of when given area specifications can be represented by Venn3 using convex curves is still unknown.In this paper we study symmetric Venn3 drawn with convex curves and show that there is a symmetric area specification that cannot be represented with such a diagram. In addition, by using symmetric diagrams drawn with polygons, we show that, if area specifications are restricted so that the double intersection areas are no greater than the triple intersection area then the specification can be drawn with convex curves. We also propose a construction that allows the representation of some area specifications when the double intersection areas are greater than the triple intersection area.Finally, we present some open questions on the topic.

An Heuristic for the Construction of Intersection Graphs

Most methods for generating Euler diagrams describe the detection of the general structure of the final drawing as the first step. This information is generally encoded using a graph, where nodes are the regions to be represented and edges represent adjacency. A planar drawing of this graph will then indicate how to draw the sets in order to depict all the set intersections. In this paper we present an heuristic to construct this structure, the intersection graph. The final Euler diagram can be constructed by drawing the sets boundaries around the nodes of the intersection graph, either manually or automatically.

Focused Animation of Dynamic Compound Graphs

2009
Many applications feature large hierarchic dynamic graphs that change over time. Often, these changes are more important than the graphs themselves.In our approach, areas of interests in dynamic graphs are detected based on user preferences. The user is guided from one area of interest to another in such a way that reduced contextual information is shown. To this end, dynamic graph layout mechanisms are extended by a reprocessing that decides what to show and a post processing that stages the animation based on spatial information.

Multiscale Visual Analysis of Lexical Networks
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
A lexical network is a very useful resource for natural language processing systems. However, building high quality lexical networks is a complex task. "Jeux de mots" is a Web game which aims at building a lexical network for the French language. At the time of this paper's writing, "jeux de mots" contains 164 480 lexical terms and 397 362 associations. Both lexical terms and associations are weighted with a metric that determines the importance of a given term or association. Associations between lexical terms are typed. The network grows as new games are played. The analysis of such a lexical network is challenging. The aim of our work is to propose a multi-scale interactive visualization of the network to facilitate its analysis. Our work builds on previous work in multi-scale visualization of graphs. Our main contribution in this domain includes (1) the automatic computation of compound graphs, (2) the proximity measure used to compute compound nodes, and (3) the computation of the containment relation used to exhibit the dense relation between one important node and a set of related nodes.

A Coloring Solution to the Edge Crossing Problem
2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2009
We introduce the concept of coloring close and crossing edges in graph drawings with perceptually opposing colors making them individually more distinguishable and reducing edge-crossing effects. We define a "closeness" metric on edges as a combination of distance, angle and crossing. We use the inverse of this metric to compute a color embedding in the L*a*b* color space and assign "close" edges colors that are perceptually far apart. We present the following results: a distance metric on graph edges, a method of coloring graph edges, and anecdotal evidence that this technique can improve the reading of graph edges.

Automatic Application of the Data-State Model in Data-Flow Contexts
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
The data-state and data-flow models of information visualization are known to be expressively equivalent. Each model is most effective for different combinations of analysis processes and data characteristics. Visualization frameworks tend to either (1) work within a single model or (2) permit either model in separate sub-frameworks. In either case, converting between the two models falls entirely to the programmer. The theoretical basis for automatic translation between the two models was established by Chi. However, that process is insufficiently specified to be directly implemented. This paper characterizes the practical advantages of the data-state model. This is used to identify when such a transformation is beneficial. It then expands on Chi's theoretical framework to provide the tools for translating visualization program fragments from the data-flow to the data-state model. A partial implementation of the expanded theory is described for the Stencil visualization environment.

A Visualization Technique for Access Patterns and Link Structures of Web Sites
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
There have been two types of Web visualization techniques: visualization of Web sites themselves based on such as link structures or lexical contents, and visualization of browsers' behaviors. We think that integration of such two visualization techniques is very useful for Web site management, and therefore we are currently studying on visualization of access pattern and link structure on a single screen. This paper presents a Web visualization technique using our own multiple-category-embedded graph visualization technique. The presented technique constructs link structures using crawler software, and access patterns from access log files. It then integrates them and visualizes by our graph visualization technique. We expect that users can visually understand the relationship between access patterns and link structures, and utilize the knowledge for design and management of Web sites. This paper shows our case study and discusses typical access patterns we observed by the technique.

A 3D Visualization Technique for Large Scale Time-Varying Data
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
We represent time-varying data as polyline charts very often. At the same time, we often need to observe hundreds or even thousands of time-varying values in one chart. However, it is often difficult to understand such large-scale time-varying if all the values are drawn in a single polyline chart. This paper presents a polyline-based 3D time-varying data visualization technique. The technique places a set of polylines in the 3D space, where the X-axis denotes time, the Y-axis denotes values, and the polylines are arranged along the Z-axis. It provides two views: the first viewpoint has a view direction along Y-axis, and the second viewpoint has a view direction along Z-axis. The technique displays the overview of the data from the first viewpoint, and the detail of the specific parts of the data from the second viewpoint. It also detects frequent or outlier patterns by applying SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation), and indicates them so that users can discover such characteristic patterns. This paper shows several interesting visualization examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented technique.

Drawing Clustered Bipartite Graphs in Multi-circular Style
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Bipartite graphs are often used to illustrate relationships between two sets of data, such as web pages and visitors. At the same time, information is often organized hierarchically, for example, web pages are divided into directories by their contents. The hierarchical structures are useful for analyzing information. Graphs with both a bipartite structure and a hierarchical structure are called &#x201C;clustered bipartite graphs.&#x201D; A new clustered bipartite graphs visualization technique was developed for representing both bipartite and hierarchical structures simultaneously. In this technique, nodes in one set of the bipartite graph, which are leaves of a tree, are arranged in hierarchical multi-circular style. Then, nodes in the other set of the bipartite graph are arranged by the force-directed method. The technique enables step-by-step exploration for large-scale bipartite graphs.

The Network Lens: Interactive Exploration of Multivariate Networks Using Visual Filtering
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Networks are widely used in modeling relational data often comprised of thousands of nodes and edges. This kind of data alone implies a challenge for its visualization as it is hard to avoid clutter of network elements if using traditional node-link diagrams. Moreover, real-life network data sets usually represent objects with a large number of additional attributes that need to be visualized, such as in software engineering, social network analysis, or biochemistry. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called Network Lens, to visualize such attributes in context of the underlying network. Our implementation of the Network Lens is an interactive tool that extends the idea of so-called magic lenses in such a way that users can interactively build and combine various lenses by specifying different attributes and selecting suitable visual representations.

Preserving Coherent Illumination in Style Transfer Functions for Volume Rendering
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Volume rendering has been widely used in different fields where several rendering algorithms have been developed, such as shear-warp, ray casting or splatting. But independently of the rendering method, transfer functions are usually used for mapping values and other properties of the volume into colors. As an improvement of transfer functions, style transfer functions are being used, where sphere maps extracted from artwork are used instead of plain colors. In this paper, we propose an interactive designer that would allow the user to create styles in an easy way, and shade them with just a color or a texture. In addition, it guarantees a coherent illumination, making it possible to easily use style transfer functions to achieve realistic rendering.

Extracting Events from Spatial Time Series
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
An important task in exploration of data about phenomena and processes that develop over time is detection of significant changes that happened to the studied phenomenon. Our research is focused on supporting detection of significant changes, called events, in multiple time series of numeric values. We developed a suite of visual analytics techniques that combines interactive visualizations on time-aware displays and maps with statistical event detection methods implemented in R. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using two large data sets.

An Interactive Visualization Framework for Time-Series of Web Graphs in a 3D Environment
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
We propose an interactive framework for the 3D visualization of the time-series of Web graphs. The purpose of our framework is to enable users to examine the evolution of Web graphs by comparing multiple graphs that have different timings and topics. To achieve this, we provide TimeSlices that are 2D planes to visualize Web graphs in a 3D environment. Users can interactively add new TimeSlices along the timeline, and they can manipulate them to animate Web graphs. Visualized Web graphs on TimeSlices are snapshots of different timings. Moreover, we provide mechanisms to generate and manipulate overlay views and parallel views in the 3D environment to enable Web graphs to be compared. Users can seamlessly change these viewing modes. Our system can also visualize two Web graphs created from different keywords to display the evolutional correlation between them. This system enables us to observe structural and temporal changes in multiple Web graphs such as shifts in influential blogs or power shifts in the diffusion of blogs between topics.

Combining Visual Analytics and Content Based Data Retrieval Technology for Efficient Data Analysis
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
One of the most useful techniques to help visual data analysis systems is interactive filtering (brushing). However, visualization techniques often suffer from overlap of graphical items and multiple attributes complexity, making visual selection inefficient. In these situations, the benefits of data visualization are not fully observable because the graphical items do not pop up as comprehensive patterns. In this work we propose the use of content-based data retrieval technology combined with visual analytics. The idea is to use the similarity query functionalities provided by metric space systems in order to select regions of the data domain according to user-guidance and interests. After that, the data found in such regions feed multiple visualization workspaces so that the user can inspect the correspondent datasets. Our experiments showed that the methodology can break the visual analysis process into smaller problems (views) and that the views hold the expectations of the analyst according to his/her similarity query selection, improving data perception and analytical possibilities. Our contribution introduces a principle that can be used in all sorts of visualization techniques and systems, this principle can be extended with different kinds of integration visualization-metric-space, and with different metrics, expanding the possibilities of visual data analysis in aspects such as semantics and scalability.

GVIS: An Integrating Infrastructure for Adaptively Mashing up User Data from Different Sources
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
In this article we present an infrastructure for creating mash up visual representations of the user profile that combines data from different sources. We explored this approach in the context of Life Long Learning, where different platforms or services are often used to support the learning process. The system is highly configurable and adaptive: data sources, data aggregations, and visualizations can be configured on the fly by the administrative user without changing any part of the software, and have an adaptive behavior based on linear combination of conditions about user or system characteristics. The visual profiles produced can assume different graphical formats and can be bound to different data, automatically adapting to personal preferences, knowledge, and contexts. We applied our infrastructure to a set of federated Learning Management Systems, retrieving information from different sources and creating some indicators of the learning activity. The software we developed provides learners with adaptive indicators of the learning state, and allows instructors to monitor the progress of their learners.

Kinetic Inter-acting: A System for Visual Analysis of Interaction Dynamics
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Interactions are central to our endeavours. Whether in a face-to-face session with a doctor or via one of Web 2.0 applications, the way interactions unfold has an impact on the final outcome of the session. This paper addresses the problem of the development of a visual language and analysis system, enabling visual reasoning about the quality of interactions. The paper presents a system of encoding the way interactions unfold. It presents the foundations of KIA (Kinetic Inter-Acting) visual language and the visual analysis system with this language. The language is then evaluated through comparison with expert judgments when applied to cases in health care. KIA (the language and the analysis system) enables both humans and machines to utilise information about how interactions unfold in order to improve interactions and the processes that depend on them.

Highlighting in Information Visualization: A Survey
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Highlighting was the basic viewing control mechanism in computer graphics and visualization to guide users' attention in reading diagrams, images, graphs and digital texts. As the rapid growth of theory and practice in information visualization, highlighting has extended its role that acts as not only a viewing control, but also an interaction control and a graphic recommendation mechanism in knowledge visualization and visual analytics. In this work, we attempt to give a formal summarization and classification of the existing highlighting methods and techniques that can be applied in Information Visualization, Visual Analytics and Knowledge Visualization. We propose a new three-layer model of highlighting. We discuss the responsibilities of each layer in the different stage of the visual information processing.

Polytree Numbering for Citation Networks Visualisation
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Citation networks form directed acyclic graphs. Visualisation of the reference relationships within the network requires fast determination of ancestor-descendant relationships among the nodes within the digraph. Polytrees (singly connected digraphs) constitute an important class of acyclic digraphs and can be viewed as generalised directed trees where multiple parent nodes are permitted. In this paper, we propose a new ancestral numbering scheme for polytrees that allows fast determination of ancestor-descendant relationships among the nodes without traversal. The scheme is used to index and visualise reference relationships within citation networks.

OWL Ontology Visualization: Graphical Representations of Properties on the Instance Level
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
For several ontology applications, a combination of classes with their instances, their properties on the class level and on the instance level are from interest. However, the focus of most visualization approaches is on the hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships on the class level. This paper presents an approach to visualizing datatype properties and object properties on the instance level. For this purpose, three different layouts were developed for the ontology visualization tool Knoocks. Furthermore, the paper discusses results of an evaluation that was motivated to identify which one of these layout versions was preferred by the users. The evaluation should also reveal if the concept of the representation of the properties was understandable for them.

Double Tree: An Advanced KWIC Visualization for Expert Users
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
In this paper we present Double Tree, a new visualization of Key Word In Context (KWIC) displays targeted to support linguistic analysis. Inspired by Wattenberg's and Vie&#x0301;gas' [1] Word Tree visualization, Double Tree extends the idea of representing KWIC results as trees. We address several issues with Word Trees with respect to the specific demands of linguists and discuss the design decisions and implementation details that we chose for Double Tree. In particular we present our approach for displaying a two-sided tree. We describe details of the layout, including how frequency and linguistic information is incorporated, and what user interaction is supported. We conclude with some consideration on possible next steps for Double Tree.

Liquid Diagrams: Information Visualisation Gadgets
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Information visualisation techniques have sometimes been slow to diffuse into more widespread public use. Recent advances in cloud computing have opened up opportunities to bring information visualisation to the masses in ways previously not possible. Liquid diagrams are a suite of information visualisation gadgets written in Flex, which visualise live data contained in Google Docs spreadsheets through the Google Visualization API. Users can interactively configure the visualisation and any changes in the online spreadsheet data are reflected immediately in the display. In contrast to other solutions, liquid diagrams gadgets specifically support the printing and export of both vector (SVG) and raster (PNG) graphics versions of the visualisations, allowing users to construct and export high-quality diagrams for inclusion into other works. The suite of visualisation gadgets currently available includes: area charts, bar charts, heat maps (choropleths), line charts, pie charts, treemaps, and parallel coordinates plots. Star plots and voronoi treemaps are coming soon.

Information Visualization in Facility Location and Vehicle Routing Decisions
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Facility location and vehicle routing are amongst the most important logistic decisions in today's organizations. These aspects are intertwined and, in some cases, should be addressed in an integrated way (giving rise to the location-routing approach). A decision support tool that can make easier the visualization (and editing) of information regarding these problems is becoming increasingly important as: it enables to further understand the problem at hand; and, at the same time, it fosters better communication of the decisions in a way easier to understand by the general public. This paper presents some concepts for information visualization on the problems arisen by the aforementioned decisions, which have been incorporated in a decision support tool and tested using usability evaluation methods.

Metric Data Analysis Enhanced through Temporal Visualization
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
The human vision can naturally interpret data in spaces of 2 or 3 dimensions. When data is in higher dimensional spaces, in most cases the visualization is not intuitive. Regarding metric spaces, the interpretation is even harder, since they often do not have a direct spatial representation. However, the need to analyze how metric-represented data evolve over time is pretty common when one needs to understand several phenomena and in decision making processes, as it occurs in medical and agrometeorological applications. This paper presents three interactive techniques to visualize metric data that vary over time. Each one focus on a different way to interpret the temporal information. The first technique shows data evolving in a timeline axis. The second overlaps evolving snapshots of the space showing how the space varies regarding time. The last one does not treat temporal data as a dimension, it is used instead to define the similarity among complex data, employing the new concept of metric-temporal spaces, which seamlessly integrate time and metric data into a single similarity space. Visualization examples with real datasets are presented to show the usefulness of the proposed techniques.

Interaction with Computers Using Mobile Devices
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
We propose a new interaction way that uses mobile devices to input and output devices of computers. The idea is simple but powerful, because 1) mobile devices are popular, 2) people can use them easily, 3) people carry them at all times, 4) two displays one of which is a big display for a computer and another is a small display of a mobile device may make new interaction and visualization and 5) a user can store parts of public data in physically independent device, that is his/her mobile device. We expect that our idea may make psychological barrier lower than now so that users can access and modify all data around the world more easily. In this paper, we show an example application based the idea we propose and discuss its possibilities.

From Databases to Graph Visualization
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation

2010
The first step of any information visualization system is to enable end user to import their dataset into the system. However, non expert user are faced to the difficult task of choosing how their data should/could be transform to be used in these Infovis systems. In that paper we address the case where end users want to use dataset in tabular format. We propose a novel method for automatic graph generation from these datasets. That method consists in first building taxonomy of dimensions. Then, that taxonomy is used to provide to user a system that enables to interactively navigate into the set of possible data transformation.

A Theme Landscape for Tagged Data
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
The wide variety of visualization methods for numerical values have, up until now, outweighed the relatively modest selection available for nominal dimensions. Theme Landscape is a visualization application designed for tagged data that typically contains a large number of nominal dimensions. It provides an overview of large data volumes, doing so by positioning objects in a landscape according to how similar their tags are. HexBoard technology has been used for dimension reduction. A further distinctive feature of Theme Landscape concerns the icons. The tags that belong to an object can be identified according to the shape of its icon. Each keyword is assigned to its own unique glyph and these glyphs form, in any combination, a hexagonal icon. For the prototype a data archive of interactive media artworks has been used, which had been tagged using a taxonomy.

Peek Brush: A High-Speed Lightweight Ad-Hoc Selection for Multiple Coordinated Views
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Linking+Brushing is a proven concept to reveal relationships across multiple views. Defining complex selections, however, may involve a significant interaction overhead. This paper proposes Peek Brush, a point-brush that is designed to temporarily select and highlight items hovered by the user's mouse cursor. This enables quickly skimming through the data to identify relationships between different data projections within seconds. The Peek Brush serves the purpose of defining a starting point to a more focused inspection using brushes with higher complexity. In order to achieve rapid visual updates, we discuss acceleration techniques like preprocessing, threading, and layering. As a result, the Peek Brush is able to scale to datasets with millions of entries. A case study demonstrates how the Peek Brush minimizes the interaction effort required from the user. It delivers a quick overview and reduces the time needed for the initial visual analysis step from minutes to seconds.

Visualising Virtual Learning Environments: Case Studies of the Website Exploration Tool
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
In this paper we describe the long term evaluation of the Website Exploration Tool (WET), an exploratory system for visualising web data, through the assessment of two Virtual Learning Environments (VLE). VLEs provide log files that can be studied with web mining techniques to understand the behaviour of the students and consequently improve the pedagogy. However, statistical metrics are not always easy to interpret for the educators, which suggests the need to develop novel approaches for the easy discovery of usage patterns. The integration of WET in the assessment process of two VLEs gave us the opportunity to conduct long-term case studies that supported the evaluation of the visual approaches used in our tool. Our main contributions are the description of the benefits of such approaches for the analysis of VLEs as well as recommended features for supporting this task, and a summary of the main findings from our case studies.

To meet the growing demand of communicating climate science and policy research, the interdisciplinary field of climate visualization has increasingly extended its traditional use of 2D representations and techniques from the field of scientific visualization to include information visualization for the creation of highly interactive tools for both spatial and abstract data. This paper provides an initial discussion on the need and design of evaluations for climate visualization. We report on previous experiences and identify how evaluation methods commonly used in information visualization can be used in climate visualization to increase our understanding of visualization techniques and tools.

None
2010
This paper addresses some fundamental and practical issues that should be considered when pursuing evaluation studies in Information Visualization. The main focus is on quantitative experimental research but the general information applies to all kinds of studies. The purpose is to increase awareness of what constitutes a sound scientific approach to evaluation and to point out common pitfalls and mistakes during the phases of such study. These phases cover how to plan, design, conduct and analyse the outcome of an evaluation and finally how to report in a way that enhances readability, provides details relevant to the outcome and that allows replication. The paper could be used as a guide when conducting evaluation and it could also be helpful when reviewing publications since the same rules apply.

2010
Despite the growing number of systems providing visual analytic support for investigative analysis, few empirical studies include investigations on the analytical reasoning process that needs to be supported. In this paper, we present an approach to evaluate the ability of certain visual representations from an integrated visual-computational environment to support the completion of representative tasks. The problem area studied is the detection and identification of anomalous vessels and situations while monitoring maritime traffic data. This paper presents: (1) a brief review of current evaluation methodologies within information visualization and visual analytics, (2) an analysis of operator's analytical reasoning process (derived from field work in maritime control centers and a literature review on analytical reasoning theories), (3) a list of representative tasks for usability evaluation and (4) an approach to evaluate the use of normal behavioral models representations during the detection process.

The work presented in this paper aims at exploring new ways of integrating, visualizing and interacting with geotechnical and geophysical data that may be more rich and interactive than those offered by most current Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Some visualization techniques enabling simultaneous visualization of the several data types available in our case study are proposed. Moreover, methods were developed to guide experts while defining layers and other relevant geological structures. The work is still in an early stage and is main goal has been assessing the validity and adequacy of the proposed techniques to the specific geotechnical and geophysical data under consideration.

None
2010
Accessing personal and online music libraries with thousands of songs has become an everyday activity. Instead of textual lists, the libraries can also be accessed using graphical visualizations such as adaptive avatars. To develop the idea further, we designed 17 stereotypical avatars representing different musical genres. To study how well the avatars were recognized, an online questionnaire with 71 participants was arranged. This paper discusses the design of the avatars in more detail, explains which musical genres were selected for the study and why, and presents the results of the questionnaire.

Visualization of Multi-sensory Meeting Information to Support Awareness
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Awareness of shared work activities is important for fostering professional relationships. This paper introduces visualization techniques for a meeting support system based on automatic speech recognition and multisensory meeting information capture, including voice levels and participant comments. The system has been deployed in live meetings over the past 5 months and we report meeting participants' expectations and findings from a field study. Initial findings suggest that the proposed approach can facilitate awareness without the need for detailed meeting transcriptions and associated audio recordings, however the quality of speech recognition results and their effective visualization remain critical factors for increased adoption.

Wearing Emotions: Physical Representation and Visualization of Human Emotions Using Wearable Technologies
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
This paper presents the iterative design process used in generating several prototypes and proofs of concept for wearable, technological devices which are capable of implementing emotional skins. Reactive layers have the potential to act as visualization surfaces to represent individuals' or groups' emotional configurations depending on the specific strategies which can be applied to a wide range of human activities. These emotionally-aroused, interactive skins can be used in generating cognitive processes which are relevant for social communication, knowledge dissemination and education. The research project aimed at exploring the potential use of these devices in emotion classification and methodologies for representing and enacting dynamics that are significant from cognitive, ethnographic and psychologic perspectives.

2010
The analysis of large sums of soccer statistics can be extremely difficult if the data is not presented graphically. As a result, we developed an application, titled Soccer Scoop, which provides two separate visualizations that can aid a soccer team manager. With our application, a team manager can compare two players on different teams, analyze a particular player before signing them to a contract, measure the performance of a particular player at different positions, generate practice exercises, and determine if a particular player plays better on the road or at home. The visualizations used in our application apply information visualization techniques, such as glyphs, modified star plots, details on demand, color, and gestalt principles.

Oncology Lifeline - A Timeline Tool for the Interdisciplinary Management of Breast Cancer Patients in a Surgical Clinic
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
The multidisciplinary approach to breast cancer treatment in a comprehensive breast center model can deliver a high standard of care for the patient, but it also generates a wide range of patient data that are typically left as disparate silos, and not organized or analyzed for any clinician to help with patient care. We have developed a method for the synthesis of radiology, surgery, pathology, medical oncology, and genetics information from a patient medical history in a timeline paradigm with elements of clinical decision support and quality indicators to help with decision making. A model for structuring data from the many disparate sources was developed to support enriched probing interactions. Summary views of the current knowledge from each discipline were also tightly integrated. To support the surgical management workflow, the prototype lifelines were integrated into existing clinical software, incorporating all the relevant events, decisions, and data elements.

Real-Time Ray Tracing of Complex Molecular Scenes
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Molecular visualization is one of the cornerstones in structural bioinformatics and related fields. Today, rasterization is typically used for the interactive display of molecular scenes, while ray tracing aims at generating high-quality images, taking typically minutes to hours to generate and requiring the usage of an external off-line program. Recently, real-time ray tracing evolved to combine the interactivity of rasterization-based approaches with the superb image quality of ray tracing techniques. We demonstrate how real-time ray tracing integrated into a molecular modelling and visualization tool allows for better understanding of the structural arrangement of biomolecules and natural creation of publication-quality images in real-time. However, unlike most approaches, our technique naturally integrates into the full-featured molecular modelling and visualization tool BALL View, seamlessly extending a standard workflow with interactive high-quality rendering.

2010
Intravital microscopy permits observation of live events in intact tissues to study a variety of issues, including quantifying cell-vessel wall interactions. The analysis of the parameters is labor-intensive, subjective and limited to broad categories of blood cell-vessel wall interactions. We are developing an algorithmic approach that aids in analysis, automatically and objectively detects and tracks platelets, and expands information derived from such videos. We integrate computer vision and break the identification, tracking and visualization into steps. We enable simple and computationally efficient means of eliminating movement within a video based on positively shifting of an identified feature and visualize platelet paths.

Interactive Patient Records
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Researches in humanities and social sciences indicate that people using more visual information would be more creative and benefit from the power of the human mind to a higher degree. Therefore information should not only be recorded as static text. It is rather conceivable to construct new visual languages that are not based on letters but on icons. We developed a set of medical symbols that can be used in visual representations of medical records and that may also be used to build complex medical statements. Each of the basic symbols is available in 4 abstraction levels, which can be combined in a `visual sentence'. Complex visual representations are recognized more easily than simplified versions, while on the other hand the simple version can be perceived and memorized in a faster way than complex signs. To prove this hypothesis and to evaluate the perception of the symbols in a medical context we created a web-based evaluation tool covering two perception tests. With the help of the symbol library we developed a visual language for patient records and an interactive browser.

The ACGT Oncosimulator is an integrated Grid-based system, under development within a 25-partner European-Japanese project, for patient-specific simulation of the response of a tumour and surrounding tissue to various forms of therapy. The validation of the simulation code is an activity requiring extensive human-driven visual investigation of the influence of each of the dozens of parameters to the code, and comparison of the simulation results against the known outcomes of past patient treatments. This activity therefore calls for a visualisation environment that supports users in working with an extremely large potential result space, and in rapidly setting up visualisations that highlight the differences between chosen subsets of available results. We describe the innovative features of the OncoRecipeSheet, an environment designed to meet these requirements.

INSPIRE: A New Method of Mapping Information Spaces
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Information spaces such the WWW are the most challenging type of space that many people navigate during everyday life. Unlike the real world, there are no effective maps of information spaces, so people are forced to rely on search engines which are only suited to some types of retrieval task. This paper describes a new method for creating maps of information spaces, called INSPIRE. The INSPIRE engine is a tree drawing algorithm that uses a city metaphor, comprised of streets and buildings, and generates maps entirely automatically from webcrawl data. A technical evaluation was carried out using data from 112 universities, which had up to 485, 775 pages on their websites. Although they take longer to compute than radial layouts (e.g., the Bubble Tree), INSPIRE maps are much more compact. INSPIRE maps also have desirable aesthetic properties of being orthogonal, preserving symmetry between identical subtrees and being planar.

Visualization of Web Page Content Using Semantic Technologies
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
This paper presents a system for visualizing the information contained in the text of a web page. The goal of the visualization is to help the users better and faster understand the text on a web page and/or find related content on the internet. These visualizations are possible due to the use of text mining, natural language processing and semantic web technologies. Our system tries to make these technologies instantly accessible to a wide variety of users reading a wide variety of web pages. This high coverage of both users and content can be achieved because the system is implemented as an extension to Firefox, one of the most popular browsers, and because the visualizations are computed on the fly for any page the user happens to be reading at a given moment.

2010
Photo-sharing websites such as Flickr and Panoramio contain millions of geotagged images contributed by people from all over the world. Characteristics of these data pose new challenges in the domain of spatio-temporal analysis. In this paper, we define several different tasks related to analysis of attractive places, points of interest and comparison of behavioral patterns of different user communities on geotagged photo data. We perform analysis and comparison of temporal events, rankings of sightseeing places in a city, and study mobility of people using geotagged photos. We take a systematic approach to accomplish these tasks by applying scalable computational techniques, using statistical and data mining algorithms, combined with interactive geo-visualization. We provide exploratory visual analysis environment, which allows the analyst to detect spatial and temporal patterns and extract additional knowledge from large geotagged photo collections. We demonstrate our approach by applying the methods to several regions in the world.

From Data Realism to Dada Aggregations: Visualizations in Digital Art, Humanities and Popular Culture
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation

2010
The orientation towards data in arts, humanities and pop culture in recent years brings a renewed interest in realism and iconoclasm. The various APIs (Application programming interfaces) and mashups that are employed in these traditionally &#x201C;qualitative&#x201D; disciplines offer tools for creative and often critical interpretations. Data are becoming means of a critical distance to the visual and media saturated world that bring whole new perspective on our everyday life and reality. These emerging critical and visual practices define a realism based on data rather than on human perception, reason or some strong ontological theses. This data oriented realism does not simply represent reality but performs the modern processes of its construction with an almost iconoclastic fervor. It offers a distance from the power and seduction of the (digital) image and asks questions about their conditions of possibility, methods of gathering and the various possibilities of their representation. Visualization of various data in the form of popular user generated mashups, serious art visualizations and new digital methods in humanities create a tension between the new forms of iconoclastic realism and the more playful dada collage techniques that are satirical and rather than realist and emancipatory rather than iconoclastic. The use of visualizations in art, humanities and online popular culture (cyberculture) is defined by this tension between data realism to dada &#x201C;aggregations&#x201D;.

In this paper we present a more effective method to discover the periodicity in web log sequence data which handle missing sequences which may occur during the aggregation process, such as sequences that swing between two periods. On other hands, a sequence may start near the end time of a period where the rest of those sequences appear in next period however, these kinds of issues certainly it will leave its effect of periodicity discovery. Moreover, we incorporated OLAP data cube techniques in the aggregation process in order to handle large generated sequences and visualised the discovered periodic patterns, in order to study its impact on periodicity discovery.

The large and ever-increasing amounts of time-varying and geospatial digital weather information related to emergency scenarios that must be accessible to the public represent a major research challenge. A need to analyze and make decisions, often in time-critical situations, demand interactive web-enabled visualization tools that can aid the user to explore, communicate and publish visually large geo-information spaces. Geovisual analytics is an emerging research task facilitating dynamic time-linked visual representations that enable the users to simultaneously analyse relations among several different attributes with the aim to augment an analyst and decision-maker capabilities to assimilate complex situations and reach important knowledge. In this context, we introduce a web-enabled application for road weather visualization, a tool for analyzing and communicating information about road weather conditions particularly during the Swedish winter months. RoadVis is customized in close collaboration with domain experts from Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) and the Swedish road administration facilitating a collection of dynamic map, weather and information visualization methods integrated with the Adobe&#x00A9; Flash&#x00A9; and Flex&#x00A9; development platform.

2010
Searching and exploring on digital maps are normally performed through simple text boxes and zoom-and-pan interfaces. In this paper, however, we present a novel technique, namely Taggram, which combines texts onto maps to support geo-tagged data exploration. It is designed to show geo-tagged data in form of size-varied and colorized tags, benefiting by the concepts of Tag Clouds, and to support exploring those data interactively through a fisheye menu adaptation. The technique was demonstrated for geo-tagged data exploration; however, as other thematic geo-data can be partially represented in abstract form of texts, Taggram can be a method for the presentation and exploration of such geo-data in other application scenarios.

3D Edge Bundling for Geographical Data Visualization
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation

2010
Visualization of graphs containing many nodes and edges efficiently is quite challenging since representations generally suffer from visual clutter induced by the large amount of edge crossings and node-edge overlaps. That problem becomes even more important when nodes positions are fixed, such as in geography were nodes positions are set according to geographical coordinates. Edge bundling techniques can help to solve this issue by visually merging edges along common routes but it can also help to reveal high-level edge patterns in the network and therefore to understand its overall organization. In this paper, we present a generalization of [18] to reduce the clutter in a 3D representation by routing edges into bundles as well as a GPU-based rendering method to emphasize bundles densities while preserving edge color. To visualize geographical networks in the context of the globe, we also provide a new technique allowing to bundle edges around and not across it.

A 3D Visualization of Multiple Time Series on Maps

2010
In the analysis of spatially-referenced time-dependent data, gaining an understanding of the spatio-temporal distributions and relationships among the attributes in the data can be quite difficult. We present a visualization technique that addresses some of the challenges involved in visually exploring and analyzing the distributions of geo-spatial time-varying data. We have developed a pictorial representation that is based on the standard space-time cube metaphor and provides in a single display the overview and details of a large number of time-varying quantities. Our approach involves three-dimensional graphical widgets that intuitively represent profiles of the time-varying quantities and can be plotted on a geographic map to expose interesting spatio-temporal distributions of the data. We show how combining our visualization technique with standard data exploration features can assist in the exploration of salient patterns in a data set. The visualization approach described here supports expeditious exploration of multiple data sets; this in turn assists the process of building initial hypotheses about the attributes in a data set and enhances the user's ability to pose and explore interesting questions about the data.

2010
An experiment was conducted to add empirical evidence whether the use of visualization is better than text in the communication of business strategies. Seventy-four managers who took part in an Executive MBA program saw a presentation of the simplified strategy of BMW Financial Services. The visual support of the presentation was manipulated by the author and the according effects were measured. Three different types of visual support were chosen: text in the form of PowerPoint (1), visualization in the form of a visual metaphor (2), and a roadmap (3). Each subject saw only one of the three types of visual support. The effects measured were attention, comprehension, agreement and retention. In addition the perception of the visual and the perception of the presenter were measured for each of the three conditions. Subjects who were exposed to visualization in the form of visual metaphor and roadmap paid significantly more attention to the strategy, agreed more with the strategy and recalled the strategy better than did subjects who saw text in the form of PowerPoint. No significant superiority was found for visualization compared to text in understanding the strategy. Subjects who were exposed to visualization in the form of visual metaphor and roadmap perceived the visual and the presenter significantly better than did those subjects who where exposed to text in the form of PowerPoint. In addition the perception of the visual accounted for 69% of the variation of the perception of the presenter.

2010
Growing evidence in the scientific literature and in organizations shows the positive impact of employing conceptual visual representation for individual reasoning, communicating and facilitating meetings in organizations. 116 managers responded a questionnaire on the usefulness of 12 common business visualizations for typical knowledge tasks in organizations. The resulting ranking provides an overview of the comparative suitability of visualizations for generating ideas, sharing knowledge, evaluating options and planning. The findings can be used by organizations for evaluating visual templates as a support for specific knowledge tasks. Theoretical implications include the relationship between the structure level of knowledge visualization forms and convergent/divergent task type. Further implications for theory and practice are discussed.

How Users Perceive and Use Interactive Information Graphics: An Exploratory Study
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
This paper presents an exploratory empirical study about users' reception and usage behavior with interactive information graphics. 14 participants took part in the study. We assume users to act interest-driven. Therefore no explicit tasks were assigned to participants. In order not to distract the user, retrospective thinking aloud was employed. Results show that (1) usage durations were heterogeneous between users and between different types of interactive information graphics; (2) users tended to watch introductory animations; (3) initial orientation without interaction on the first content screen (after intro) was rather long with 23 seconds on average; (4) story-based approaches seem to motivate users but might lead to less intensive reception of information; (5) several reception and usage problems have been identified regarding information presentation and interaction. Interactive information graphics tend to overwhelm users with too much information and disregard well-known principles and rules of the old media and web design.

2010
Although the application of sketch-based chart annotation is not pervasive in management, the use of sketchmarks can provide numerous benefits to managerial discussions. The collaborative use of chart annotations can support management teams in their decision making based on quantitative charts by visually eliciting and capturing interpretation processes, clarifying basic assumptions, stimulating different perspectives, and extrapolating trends into the future. Sketch-based annotations combine the simplicity and immediacy of drawing with the clarity and richness of charting. In this paper, we provide the rationale for this under-researched visual management and communication practice, illustrate it through examples, and - as our main contribution - provide a first overview classification of the different sketchmarks that management groups can use in their discussion of quantitative charts (for such contexts as strategy or project reviews). In the end of the paper we briefly describe our future research in this area and highlight implications for management.

2010
The advent of consumer-generated and social media has led to a continuous expansion and diversification of the media landscape. Media consumers frequently find themselves assuming the role of media analysts in order to satisfy personal information needs. We propose to employ Knowledge Visualization methods in support of complex media analysis tasks. In this paper, we describe an approach which depicts semantic relationships between key political actors using node-link diagrams. Our contribution comprises a force-directed edge bundling algorithm which accounts for semantic properties of edges, a technical evaluation of the algorithm and a report on a real-world application of the approach. The resulting visualization fosters the identification of high-level edge patterns which indicate strong semantic relationships. It has been published by the Austrian Press Agency APA in 2009.

Visual Intention in Moving Image Editing and Eye-Tracking Methodology. An Exploratory Study
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Moving images production teams' skills in directing the visual perception of viewers have been confirmed lately through eye-tracking methodology. One interest lies in explaining the use of different techniques by the production team for its realization of visual intentions. These intentions are however many in most moving images. This paper undertakes the development of a method for grasping the film or video editors' intentions with the editing of moving images, and has been carried out as an exploratory study. The method suggested considers conventions of the trade, observational study with running screen-dump and proximate interviews with editors on specific edits, as well as the testing of moving image sequences where the intention of each edit point is known. The test is conducted on viewers, with the use of eye-tracking techniques. The findings are that the method should be useful in distinguishing between when the editors' grip on the audience is firm, and when it is rather vague. But the method also suggests new aspects of understanding the viewers' gazes when watching moving images.

Ancestral Forces in Contemporary Indigenous Australian Women's Art: 3 Case Studies of Multi-dimensional Cultural Heritage Knowledge
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
The transition from ephemeral, ceremonial art to more permanent acrylic-on-board paintings has made Australian Aboriginal art more accessible to the public than ever before. However, early examples contained secret/sacred motifs and stories - knowledge recorded in the paintings that was normally only made available to initiates. In turn, this prompted contemporary Australian Aboriginal artists to hide, camouflage or remove the sensitive material from their work. It is only recently, through inter-gender and inter-cultural collaborations between contemporary Indigenous Australian artists and non-indigenous ethnographers and anthropologists, that the full ramifications of this transition is becoming apparent. This paper discusses 3 case studies where the traditional expression of Kuruwarri, or Ancestral power, has been transformed through contemporary Australian Aboriginal women's art.

Re-writing Recent History: Developing a National Reconciliation Pedagogy Using a Video Game for School Age Children
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Australian Aboriginal people have suffered ignominy through British policies and practices since the legal conquest of their land in 1788. They have been historically and socially misrepresented on the premise of their race alone. Recent attempts at reconciliation have come some way towards a shared culture. However, the national curriculum has not been effective in promoting reconciliation as an important part of a student's education. As a pedagogical tool for advancing notions of reconciliation a game was developed. The pedagogical goal of the game is for students to experience notions of trust, empathy and collaboration - core to notions of reconciliation. Initial evaluation of the game suggests these goals are being met.

Conceptualisations of Self in Contemporary Interactive Artwork: A Case Study of Lynette Wallworth's Duality of Light
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
This paper, which is contextualised in terms of the broader history of the moving image, examines new media artist Lynette Wallworth's installation Duality of Light with respect to recent advances in neuroscientific research. These have led to greater understanding of how the brain processes visual imagery. Of greatest relevance to Wallworth's work is the discovery that the binding of the largely anatomically segregated attributes of colour, motion and faces occurs asynchronously and is subject to a temporal hierarchy. Moreover, such binding is post-conscious. Further to this, following Gansing, while simultaneously factoring in these recent neuroscientific advances, the idea of `interactivity' is challenged. The inadequacy of `interactive' as an undifferentiated descriptor, often uniformly applied to diverse new media works, is also highlighted. Works such as those created by Wallworth - whose work is informed intuitively by these recent neuroscientific findings - reveal the shortcomings of such homogenising terminology. Finally, this exploratory paper, which will form the basis of further work, demonstrates the interwoven nature of the aforementioned subject matter and thematic concerns.

2010
This paper describes a series of transdisciplinary research projects in five large-scale, interactive visualization architectures. These immersive architectures and their associated visual, sonic and algorithmic techniques offer compelling means for mapping and remediating the tangible, intangible and abstract aspects of culture and heritage landscapes. This paper brings these unique systems and the installations developed for them together for the first time. The task here is to highlight the strategies for embodied, kinaesthetic, multisensory and collaborative engagement as powerful ways to reformulate narrative made possible through these stereographic, panoramic, situated interfaces.

Embodying Affect: The Stolen Generations, the History Wars and PolesApart by Indigenous New Media Artist r e a
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
In her 2009 new media artwork PolesApart, Australian Aboriginal artist r e a, of the Gamilaraay people in northern New South Wales, explores issues relating to the Stolen Generations of Aboriginal children. Based on the personal experiences of her grandmother and great aunt as `stolen children', r e a amplifies the work's familial dimension by enacting the role of the protagonist fleeing from forced servitude. This paper looks at PolesApart in the broader context of the interrelated phenomena of the stolen generations and the so-called `history wars'. It is posited that the power, immediacy and affective dimensions of (moving) visual imagery have been instrumental in shifting Australians' knowledge about the stolen generations from the margins into the mainstream. The capacity of the moving image to `embody affect', it is argued, has enabled many more Australians than previously to appreciate the historical implications and continuing ramifications of this prolonged episode in Australian history. This has in turn led to the development of a more sympathetic public understanding of the phenomenon of the stolen generations as `lived experience'. In turn this broader social knowledge, and its integration into our shared cultural heritage, has contributed to Australians' general receptiveness to the official Apology issued to members of the stolen generations by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in Federal Parliament (13th February 2008). It is also the case that the popular reception of mainstream stolen generation-themed movies has influenced Australians' openness to the themes and issues explored in contemporary non-mainstream new media work such as r e a's PolesApart. In the latter work, through the use of the vehicle of her own body, r e a demonstrates that the personal is inescapably political, and vice versa.

Database Narratives: Conceptualising Digital Heritage Databases in Remote Aboriginal Communities
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
Interactive web-based resources are significant to the mediation of culture in that they act as an interface (Newton: 2003) between communities and information structures. The focus of this paper is on the use of digital media arts and user-centered technologies to develop a digital heritage resource to revitalize a community's cultural capital. The paper addresses the creation and use of an interactive database that forms the portal to a digital repository of archival media. The database supports and extends an Australian classic memoir, Journey to Horseshoe Bend by TGH Strehlow. Journey to Horseshoe Bend is a vivid ethno-historiographic account of the Aboriginal (Arrernte/Arrarnta), settler and Lutheran communities of Central Australia in the 1920's. The Journey to Horseshoe Bend database draws on a broad range of visual representations (including images, maps, concept diagrams, text and other media resources), and through hyperlinks connects these media to specific annotated points in an electronic version of the book. The paper focuses on the book's use as a digital heritage resource and explores the link between information architectures and knowledge practices in particular contexts to address the following question: How can a digital heritage resource be conceived as a sustainable emerging &#x201C;thing-in-the-making&#x201D; to reflect community, cultural and knowledge interests?

2010
Nowadays professional journalists create and edit broadcasting materials inside newsrooms that are characterized by an intense and multivariate flux of information. Within these settings, the journalists have difficulties keeping up with the evolving geopolitical picture of events developing in the world and how it relates to the topics of their interest. In this paper we present AmbientNEWS, an ambient display that visualizes dynamic news content and informs professional journalists on the global picture of events. We argue that the conceptualization and design of its information aesthetics criteria can be grounded in user requirements, and subsequently engaged to augment the awareness of professionals in an environment that is highly crowded with information. We also discuss the evaluation process of ambient information visualization with a focus on aesthetic design aspects. We conclude by summarizing our findings and discuss future work.

From Data to Knowledge - Visualizations as Transformation Processes within the Data-Information-Knowledge Continuum
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
In this paper we suggest a different approach that considers visualizations in the wider domain of communication and defines a model capable of taking into account the context in which visualizations act as communication tools. In this perspective we consider visualizations as transformation processes within the Data-Information-Knowledge (DIK) continuum. In the paper we discuss the continuum, and apply the transformation process model to the main disciplines of visualization. Visualizations represent powerful cognitive tools that surround our everyday life. By doing this we are able to think about visualization from a multidisciplinary perspective, exploring the role of visualizations in design practice, as artifacts that are used in facing problems of various degrees of complexity and nature. The contribution of the model is mainly addressed to orientate and nurture the reflective practice and to formalize the strategic more than the technical role of visualizations in the design discipline.

The Aesthetic and the Poietic Elements of Information Design
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
In this paper I address two types of perspectives on the aesthetic that are of relevance for a discussion of contemporary information design. Firstly, the 'aesthetic' understood as aesthetic perception of beautiful form. Secondly, the 'aesthetic' recognized as the poietic activity, i.e. the production of an object, in which the recipient also takes part. These perspectives are discussed, in brief, in relation to questions of form and content, and I argue that aesthetic elements in some contemporary information designs cannot be understood as aesthetic perception of beautiful form. The aesthetic is still present, but as poietic, creative, elements. Finally, I discuss the poietic activity in the light of McLaughlin's Heideggerian view, that the passing on of information is never neutral.

In information systems the data representation covers a great importance. In fact the visualization of information is the last point of contact between the user and the information system. This is the space where the communication takes place. In real-time monitoring systems, this passage covers a great importance, especially for reasons related to the time and the transparency of relevant information. These factors are fundamental to vessel monitoring systems. This is the beginning where we start to define a guidelines manual, act to help specialists of information visualization in the vessel monitoring field, and in the GIS field more in general.

Conventionally, a grid generator requires either an explicit or implicit description about the boundary vertices, boundary lines and boundary faces to define the geometry. In 2006, the author has developed the Interactive Web based Grid Geometry Construction process to create and generate 2D ubiquitous platform independent, highly scalable, paintbrush, pixel and vector free geometry art. In 2008, she has established a new paradigm -- basically, a fundamental medium for visualization, development, creation and delivery tool for generating grid geometry art and beyond. With exceptions, the result is instantly Web-enabled. She demonstrates the results of the deployment of this image editor free tool by presenting an array of instant conceptualization and artistic realization of an &#x201C;image&#x201D; as an arrangement of an uniform m x n grid of colored cells formed within a set of finite orthogonal grids. Beyond which, this paper presents a wide-ranging display of non-orthogonal and soft-edged image free images.

EMG Biofeedback Based VR System for Hand Rotation and Grasping Rehabilitation
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation

2010
Individuals who have upper limb movement problems include people with cerebral palsy (CP) and stroke victims. Both these conditions lead to difficulties in daily activities such as reaching, grasping etc. Virtual reality (VR), which could provide a repetitive multimodal task-oriented rehabilitation environment for patients to undertake self-training in safety, is considered to be a suitable tool for medical health rehabilitation. Using electromyography (EMG) biofeedback in rehabilitation could provide patients with opportunities to improve the ability by assessing their muscle activity response and learning self-control of movement during specific training tasks. This paper presents a study on developing EMG as an important interactive tool in a VR based system for hand rotation and grasping motion rehabilitation. The input interface includes an EMG system and a real-time magnetic motion tracking system, and the output interface is a PC monitor. The developed EMG biofeedback based VR system enables the user to interact with virtual objects in real-time with multiform feedback. Ten healthy subjects participated in the preliminary task evaluation test, and the results suggest that the specified skills have improved during training. The beneficial effects of the developed system indicate the potential values for further clinical application.

This paper describes the application of Medieval and Renaissance color theory to the computer graphic rendering of molecular models. In particular, Alberti's and Cennini's color theories were employed to render shaded geometric primitives such as cylinders and spheres that are the components of traditional ball-and-stick and space filling molecular models. These results were compared with standard rendering based on the OpenGL API or through ray tracing. It is found that by implementing Alberti's and Cennini's color theories as color maps within a simple chemical illustration program it is possible to create molecular imagery comparable to contemporary computer graphics schemes.

Dynamic recompilation tries to produce more efficient code by exploiting runtime information. Virtual machines like the Jikes RVM use recompilation heuristics to decide how to recompile the program, i.e. what parts are recompiled at what level of optimization. In this paper we present our post-mortem amortization analysis based on improved call stack sampling. Our tool presents the results of the analysis as an interactive visualizations to help both virtual machine implementors improve their recompilation strategies, as well as programmers assess whether these recompilation strategies pay off not only for their application as a whole, but also for individual methods.

Living Flows: Enhanced Exploration of Edge-Bundled Graphs Based on GPU-Intensive Edge Rendering
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
This paper describes an approach exploiting the full capabilities of GPU's to enhance the usability of edge bundling in real applications. Edge bundling, as well as other edge clustering approaches relying on the use of high quality edge rerouting. Typical approach for drawing edge-bundled graph is to render edges as curves. But curves generation can have a relatively high computational costs and do not easily comply with real-time interaction. Furthermore, while edge bundling provides a much better overall readability of a graph, the bundles make it more difficult to recover local information. Our goal was thus to provide fluid interaction allowing the recovery of local information through specific interaction techniques. The system we built offers folklore or classical interaction such as zoom &amp; pan, fish-eye and magnifying lens. We also implemented the Bring &amp; Go technique by Tominski et al. We proposed an approach exploiting the full computing power of GPU's when rendering graph edges as parametric splines. The gain in efficiency when running all curves computations on the GPU turns bundling techniques into techniques that can be embedded in interactive systems concerned with graphs of several thousands of nodes and edges.

Hamiltonian cycles play an important role in graph theory and data mining applications. Two Hamiltonian cycles that don't have an edge in common are known as edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (EDHCs). EDHCs are useful in computer networks. They have found applications in improving network capacity, fault-tolerance and collusion resistant mining algorithms. This paper extends previous work on collusion resistance capability of data mining algorithms. We first propose a new trust model for network computers. We then use this model as a basis to improve the collusion resistance capability of data mining algorithms. We use a performance metric to quantify the improvement.

Challenges and Perspectives of Procedural Modelling and Effects
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2010
The use of procedural modelling has risen dramatically over the last decade. This has been partly due to the increase in computing power, affording developers the opportunity to use methods that were previously infeasible. A further reason for this growth is due to the improvement of the representation of human knowledge. The development of procedural modeling has, thus far, been somewhat disjointed and ad hoc as different areas of graphics, gaming and modelling have been utilizing the technique with little reference outside of their own specialisation. This paper provides an overview of procedural modelling covering key techniques and applications and then suggests a framework for the development of a procedural modelling system that can form areas of land of both populated areas and bodies of water.

2010
This paper is primarily focused on the increased IT complexity problem and the identification of security threats in networked systems. Modern networking systems, applications and services are found to be more complex in terms of integration and distribution, therefore, harder to be managed and protected. CIOs have to put their effort on threat's identification, risk management and security evaluation processes. Objective decision making requires measuring, identifying and evaluating all enterprise events, either positive (opportunities) or negative (risks) and keeping them in perspective with the business objectives. Our approach is based on a visualisation technique that helps in decision making process, focusing on the threat identification using attack scenarios. For constructing attack scenarios we use the notion of attack graphs, as well as layered security approach. The proposed onion skin model combines attack graphs and security layers to illustrate possible threats and shortest paths to the attacker's goal. By providing few examples we justify the advantage of the threat identification technique in decision making process.

Image inpainting is a fundamental problem in image processing and has many applications [1] and [2], motivated by the recent tight frame based method on image restoration in either the image or the domain transformation. In this work, we present an inpainting model based on tixotrop non-Newtonian fluids for damaged wavelet coefficients. The advantage of this model is to make a benefit from the smoothing model and correct the lying out of the contours by putting them more clearly. Experimental results using our model show that better inpainting quality can be achieved with much less computing time.

This paper explores an evolutionary approach towards post creation markup and commentary attachments to 3D Virtual Reality models of Built Heritage from 1995 to date. A particular focus of the several projects described over this period was to enable and support web-based collaborative modelling of the built and natural environment, covering facsimiles of its current form, various interpretations of historic settings, and interpretations of the future in the form of versions of planning proposals. Throughout these projects a need was defined for non-proprietary and software-independent forms of `mark-up' for: commenting on the evolving state of and versions of modelling; linking to many different media, documentary sources and base data that served to evidence these interpretations; and for achieving consensus in opposing or supporting planned proposals. It is suggested that the necessary 3D capable GIS that support a `Google Docs' approach to web based 3D modelling collaboration and commentary are only now beginning to emerge.

Buildings account for significant carbon dioxide emissions, both in construction and operation. Governments around the world are setting targets and legislating to reduce the carbon emissions related to the built environment. Challenges presented by increasingly rigorous standards for construction projects will mean a paradigm shift in how new buildings are designed and managed. This will lead to the need for computational modelling and visualization of buildings and their energy performance throughout the life-cycle of the building. This paper briefly outline how the UK government is planning to reduce carbon emissions for new buildings. It discusses the challenges faced by the architectural, construction and building management professions in adjusting to the proposed requirements for low or zero carbon buildings. It then outlines how software tools, including the use of visualization tools, could develop to support the designer, contractor and user.

Users, generally citizens, increasingly expect that the models are a photorealistic and truthful representation of the future situation. Despite the advancements in graphics in recent years, the budget, the platform available, and the requirements of use are restraining factors for the visual quality of a 3D model. The question of the validity of models for assessment of urban development plans is therefore increasingly relevant. In this empirical field study we compared the affective qualities of a 3D model designed for online assessment and communication of urban development, with those of the urban environment in reality. The model was considered more pleasant, more modern and more uniform than the area in reality. This can be explained by specific characteristics of this type of model, such as the lively colours and the clean surfaces.

Human Perception, Virtual Reality and the Built Environment

Recent research indicates that Virtual Reality (VR) as a communication tool to convey design intent and construction methodologies in the built environment sector has been utilized to varied degrees. Currently, the effectiveness of VR has been demonstrated from conception to the final stages of projects in many fields, yet its potential within the Built Environment has still to realised, despite a variety of successful demonstrations. There is concern that the current utilisation of VR compromises its full potential, unsurprisingly, as environmental representations focus predominantly on the visual modality, regardless of the multi sensory nature of the spatial experience. In addition, there is a distinct paucity of research exploring the complex interaction of environmental design and the user, such as the role of attention or conceptual interpretation. This paper aims to identify the issues concerning the utilization of VR models to aid communication for the Built Environment with specific reference to human perception issues.

The Management of Sharing, Integrating, Tracking, and Maintaining Data-Sets, is a New and Rather Complex Task
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation

2010
With the improved uptake of Building Information Modelling (BIM) new issues are emerging. Prime in these tasks is how it is presented to the various stakeholders, in tailor made views to reflect their demands and requirements. In this fragmented sector strong in the concept of phased handovers new methods of feedback loops need to be developed, and other stakeholders outside the procurement process need to be included to progress and manage the practice. Within this scenario is the role of the facility manager, who currently operates separately to the procurement stakeholders. Bridges need to be built to bring them closer together especially in light of life cycle costing and sustainability if the buildings operations and maintenance issues are to be addressed in the design phase. The model's ability to host work phases or stages opens up a method to co-inhabit the model to accommodate both sets of stakeholders. This filtering of the model has both tremendously positive aspects but conversely larger issues of ownership and custodianship have not to date been satisfactorily resolved. There is a major role for proper management here, which has not been appropriately identified. Initially there was a clarion call to architects to adopt this role and a few years ago this seemed to return the lead role to this noble profession. But patently they are neither prepared nor keen to take on this role. Constructing architects however do seem to want this discipline which can raise their profile and possibly lead to professional recognition and prestige.

Using Web Services as Functional-Level Plug Ins for Interactive 3D Medical Visualisation
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation

2010
Web services provide remote access to distributed resources and processes through uniform interfaces. However, the latency associated with data transmission has meant that they are generally applied to non-interactive data processing. Interactive applications, in which many more user interactions and data transmissions are involved, are difficult to adapt to web service based frameworks, particularly if the interactive investigation involves large datasets. In medical imaging and visualisation, user interactions are generally a prerequisite for the detailed study and manipulation of data. As a result of major scientific initiatives, such as the Virtual Physiological Human, in which large data repositories are being set up at a variety of sites, it is becoming increasingly common for the data being investigated to be stored on a remote server. Consequently, it is now highly desirable to develop a means by which web service based interactive visualisation can be applied to distributed medical data access and clinical collaboration. This paper presents a functional-level plug-in based architecture for interactive data visualisation via web services which is being implemented within the EC-funded ContraCancrum project.

Semi-supervised Tissue Segmentation of 3D Brain MR Images
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation

2010
Clustering algorithms have been popularly applied in tissue segmentation in MRI. However, traditional clustering algorithms could not take advantage of some prior knowledge of data even when it does exist. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tissue segmentation of 3D brain MRI using semi-supervised spectral clustering. Spectral clustering algorithm is more powerful than traditional clustering algorithms since it models the voxel-to-voxel relationship as opposed to voxel-to-cluster relationships. In the semi-supervised spectral clustering, two types of instance-level constraints: must-link and cannot-link as background prior knowledge are incorporated into spectral clustering, and the self-tuning parameter is applied to avoid the selection of the scaling parameter of spectral clustering. The semi-supervised spectral clustering is an effective tissue segmentation method because of its advantages in (1) better discovery of real data structure since there is no cluster shape restriction, (2) high quality segmentation results as it can obtain the global optimal solutions in the relaxed continuous domain by eigen-decomposition and combines the pairwise constraints information. Experimental results on simulated and real MRI data demonstrate its effectiveness.

CardioAnalyser: A Software Tool for Segmentation and Analysis of the Left Ventricle from 4D MDCT Images of the Heart
2010 14th International Conference Information Visualisation

2010
Cardiac angiography using multiple detector row computerized tomography (MDCT) scanners provides 3D data concerning the heart and, in particular, the left ventricle (LV), for different cardiac phases along one cardiac cycle. Exploring this data for LV function analysis is not an easy task, given the amount of data and time involved in segmenting (or revising results provided by automatic segmentation methods) up to 12 cardiac phases. CardioAnalyser, a tool for 4D LV segmentation from MDCT data which provides a protocol to help perform LV segmentation of all cardiac phases available is presented. It uses an automatic segmentation algorithm along with a procedure which guides the user through the process. Its main goal is to reuse as much information as possible from one cardiac phase to the next in order to reduce segmentation time and the amount of user interaction.

While there has been significant progress in the treatment of ischemic heart failure, it remains a significant health and economic problem worldwide. In this paper, we present the challenges of modelling ischemic heart failure and introduce a user-friendly software system that will be a sub-set of the Virtual Pathological Heart environment which is currently being developed under the FP7 VPH2 project. This will provide patient-specific computational modelling and simulation of the human heart to assist the cardiologist and the cardiac surgeon in defining the severity and extent of disease in patients with post-ischemic Left Ventricular Dysfunction. The proposed system will provide visualisation tools for surgical assessment and planning: the registration and display of necrotic and hypo-kinetic regions; simulated surgical restoration (cutting and patching); and finally post-operative functional prediction (volume, shape and mitral valve regurgitation).

Investigating the Trend of Virtual Reality-Based Stroke Rehabilitation Systems

2010
The existing techniques used for post stroke rehabilitation have sought to offer stroke survivors with upper extremity motor deficits a system for the practice and re-learning of motor tasks. Some studies suggest that the use of Virtual Reality technologies as an assistive technology in combination with conventional therapies can achieve improved results in post stroke rehabilitation. Despite the wealth of ongoing research attempting to build a virtual reality based system for upper extremity rehabilitation, there still exists a need for a training platform that would provide whole arm rehabilitation. In order to be practical this system should ideally be low cost and involve minimal therapist involvement. This paper describes some of the applications of virtual reality that have undergone clinical trials with patients suffering from upper extremity functional motor deficits. A brief description of VR technologies that are in place, providing benefits to the stroke patients with upper extremity motor and functional deficits, alongside a proof of concept of a whole arm rehabilitation platform is presented.

The Effects of Image Speed and Overlap on Image Recognition
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Rapid Serial Visual Presentations (RSVPs) mimic the riffling of a book's pages and are widely employed as a way of gaining familiarity with a collection of images or selecting images of interest from a collection. In a typical RSVP a number of images within a collection enter a display in (say) the lower left-hand corner and move towards the opposite corner where they disappear ('diagonal RSVP'). If the rate at which images appear on the display is high, the speed with which images traverse the display may be such that the images overlap to some degree. As a consequence there is a need to know how much overlap can be tolerated without seriously affecting image recognition. Diagonal RSVP was implemented for four different levels of overlap and four different image speeds in such a way as to separate the effects of these two parameters. Participants were required to identify theme images (such as 'ships' or 'cars') in a series of image sequences at various combinations of speed and overlap. In addition to recording their performance, participants also completed a questionnaire to gauge their opinion on perceived presentation speed and ease of recognition. Results showed a significant effect of both overlap and speed on the percentage of correctly identified images. On the basis of the experimental results suggestions are made concerning interaction design for RSVP.

ImageCube: A Browser for Image Collections Associated with Multi-dimensional Datasets
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2011
Image browsing techniques thus become increasingly important for overview and retrieval of particular images in large-scale collections. At the same time, there are various sets of images which are associated with multi-dimensional or multivariate datasets. We believe that image browsing for such datasets should be inspired from multi-dimensional data visualization techniques. This paper presents Image Cube, a scatter plot-like browser for image collections associated with multi-dimensional datasets. Image Cube locates a set of images into a display space assigning a pair of dimensions to X- and Y-axes. It suggests preferable pairs of dimensions by applying Kendall's rank correlation and Entropy on the display space, so that users can easily obtain interesting visualization results. This paper presents a case scenario that a user finds a preferable car from an image collection by using Image Cube.

Layered TimeRadarTrees
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
We introduce a novel technique for visualizing dense time-varying directed and weighted multi-graphs with an additional hierarchical organization of the graph nodes. Combining Indented Tree Plots and TimeRadarTrees, we show the temporal evolution of relations in a static view. The graph edges are layered around thumbnail wheels consisting of color-coded sectors that are representatives of the graph nodes. These sectors generate implicit representations of graph edges. Start and target vertices are perceived by inspecting the color coding of sectors in the context of other sectors and their orientations. The technique puts emphasis on newer relations and hence, these are mapped to a larger display space in the radial diagram. The benefit of our technique is reduction of visual clutter from which node-link diagrams typically suffer. The visualization focuses on an easy exploration of trends, countertrends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in time-varying relational data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by applying it to dense dynamic graph data acquired from a soccer match of the 2D Soccer Simulation League.

Drawing Semi-bipartite Graphs in Anchor+Matrix Style
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2011
A bipartite graph consists of a set of nodes that can be divided into two partitions such that no edge has both endpoints in the same partition. A semi-bipartite graph is a bipartite graph with edges in one partition. Anchored map is a graph drawing technique for bipartite graphs and provides aesthetically pleasing layouts of graphs with high readability by restricting the positions of nodes in a partition. For this research, the objects of the anchored map technique were extended to semi-bipartite graphs. A hybrid layout style of anchored maps and matrix representations are proposed, and an automatic drawing technique is shown. The proposed technique arranges the nodes in one partition on a circumference like the anchored map of bipartite graphs. It also divides nodes in the other partition with edges into clusters and represents them in the matrix representations to make it easy to see connective subsets.

Visualizing Tags with Spatiotemporal References

2011
Nowadays, a great amount of data is created and distributed on the Internet. Tagging has become common practice to structure these data for easy access. Often the data and the associated tags contain spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we develop general design strategies for visualizing spatially and temporally referenced tags similar to tag clouds on maps. Temporal information of tags is encoded through the visual appearance of text or through additional visual artifacts associated with the tags, whereas the location of tags on a map illustrates the spatial references. We demonstrate our solution based on an interactive visualization prototype for the exploration of both spatial and temporal references of Flickr tags.

This paper studies the idea and feasibility of using a cube metaphor as a graphical user interface for exploring large music collections. In the implemented prototype, new music recommendations and related information are generated on the different faces of the cube based on the selected genre. In a user study with 40 participants, the cube was seen as an interesting and playful new concept that has great potential as a user interface. The prototype was considered to be inspiring and fun, and the participants appreciated to see extra information related to the currently playing track/artist. In the longer-term use, the prototype would have benefited from, e.g., text-based search functionality. Several other interesting ideas for the future development of the concept were also received.

Visualizing the Effects of Logically Combined Filters
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Filtering data is an essential process in a drill-down analysis of large data sets. Filtering can be necessary for several reasons. The main objective for filters is to uncover the relevant subsets of a dataset. Another, equally relevant goal is to reduce a dataset to dimensions to which either visualization or algorithmic analysis techniques scale. However, with multiple filters applied and possibly even logically combined, it becomes difficult for users to judge the effects of a filter chain. In this paper we present a simple, yet effective way to interactively visualize a sequence of filters and logical combinations of these. Such a visualized filter-pipeline allows analysts to easily judge the effect of every single filter and also their combination on the data set under investigation and therefore, leads to a faster and more efficient workflow. We also present an implementation of the proposed technique in an information visualization framework for the life sciences. The technique, however, could be employed in many other information visualization contexts as well.

Combined vs. Separate Views in Matrix-based Graph Analysis and Comparison

While much work has been done in the area of visualization for analysis of graphs, relatively little research exists into how best to use visualization for comparing graphs. We have developed a suite of general graph comparison questions that can be tailored to specific data sets, and compared the use of superimposed and juxtaposed views of graph matrices on an example data set. Our observations indicate that combined views are more useful in comparing general graphs, allowing for greater user accuracy in determining differences and their effects.

Concentric Sliders to Display Partial Satisfaction of Query Criteria
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
This paper describes a new approach called concentric planar slider to visually build queries and to pilot a data view. The purpose of this approach is to go beyond the binary satisfaction of the query criteria(satisfied vs. not satisfied). This UI control helps the user to know to what extent the dataset elements satisfy them. Two interactive sliders are combined in a planar setting. This plane is split into concentric zones that are associated to decreasing degrees of satisfaction of the query criteria. Various (potentially asymmetric) rules can be defined to express the non-satisfaction of a given criterion. These theoretical concepts have been implemented in a prototype whose main features are also described.

Design Considerations for Drill-down Charts

Frequency-based statistical charts are the most widespread visualizations and the preferred of Infovis novices. They are important in depicting categorical data and providing data abstraction on large datasets. The drill down feature enables better visual scaling by allowing navigation through aggregation hierarchies. In this paper we discuss design considerations that impact on the usability in drill down charts. We develop a tool based on pie chart in order to illustrate the discussion. Moreover, we suggest visual representations and an interaction model. Finally, we provide evidence on the benefit of using such techniques for visual analysis of categorical data through a short usability study.

A Task Based Performance Evaluation of Visualization Approaches for Categorical Data Analysis
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Categorical data is common within many areas and efficient methods for analysis are needed. It is, however, often difficult to analyse categorical data since no general measure of similarity exists. One approach is to represent the categories with numerical values (quantification) prior to visualization using methods for numerical data. Another is to use visual representations specifically designed for categorical data. Although commonly used, very little guidance is available as to which method may be most useful for different analysis tasks. This paper presents an evaluation comparing the performance of employing quantification prior to visualization and visualization using a method designed for categorical data. It also provides a guidance as to which visualization approach is most useful in the context of two basic data analysis tasks: one related to similarity structures and one related to category frequency. The results strongly indicate that the quantification approach is most efficient for the similarity related task, whereas the visual representation designed for categorical data is most efficient for the task related to category frequency.

Developing and Applying a User-Centered Model for the Design and Implementation of Information Visualization Tools
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2011
The objective of this paper is to show how approaches for user-centered information visualization design and development are being applied in the context of healthcare where users are not familiar with information visualization techniques. We base our design methods on user-centered frameworks in which 'prototyping' plays an important role in the process. We modify existing approaches to involve prototyping at an early stage of the process as the problem domain is assessed. We believe this to be essential, as it increases users' awareness of what information visualization techniques can offer them and that it enables users to participate more effectively in later stages of the design and development process. This also acts as a stimulus for engagement. The problem domain analysis stage of a pilot study using this approach is presented, in which techniques are being collaboratively developed with domain users from a healthcare institution. Our results suggest that this approach has engaged users, who are subsequently able to apply generic information visualization concepts to their domains and as a result are better equipped to take part in the subsequent collaborative design and development process.

The issue of multiple views coordination became more and more challenging in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) field since the apparition and the increasing success of 4D/nD CAD. In order to adapt visualization to user's business requirements in 4D-supported collaborative tools, this paper propose a method to design coordinated multiple views based on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). The method enables user's visualization needs description, visualization modes comparison. The aim is to choose appropriate visualization modes business needs, to associate interaction principles and coordination mechanisms in order to compose coordinated multiple views adapted to actor's business needs. The paper presents a case study based on literature review and interviews with construction sector practitioners.

Evaluation of Parallel Coordinates for Interactive Alarm Filtering

2011
Alarm management is a crucial part of many industrial systems used in generation, transmission and distribution of electric power as well as in production processes, for example in steel mills and oil refineries. Filtering of important alarms from unessential alarms is a critical task for operators of such systems, since failures may result in severe abnormal situations such as plant shutdowns. Currently, alarm filtering tasks are performed with alarm lists that offer limited interactivity. We evaluated an application of Parallel Coordinates for interactive filtering of alarm data by comparing its user performance against typical alarm lists. Statistical results demonstrate marginally significant evidence (p&lt;;0.1) for easy and moderate tasks while there is a highly significant evidence (p&lt;;0.01) for difficult tasks that Parallel Coordinates reduce alarm filtering time. Furthermore, Parallel Coordinates were found to reduce human mistakes.

Evaluating a Potentiometer-Based Graphical User Interface for Interacting with a Music Recommendation Service

This paper studies the idea of using potentiometers as a graphical user interface for interacting with a music recommendation service. In the implemented prototype, the user selects a musical genre and adjusts tempo and energy level potentiometers to fine-tune the play list of new music recommendations. The look of the interface is changed to reflect the currently selected genre. In a user study with 40 participants, the idea of using potentiometers to access music collections was found to be suitable for discovering new music and to complement traditional music player applications. The prototype was seen to be easy to use and entertaining, and the graphical designs matched well with the musical genres. In the longer-term use, the prototype was slightly too simple and it would have benefited from e.g. text-based search functionality. Several other interesting ideas for the future development of the concept were also received.

Interactive Information Visualization for Sensemaking in Power Grid Supervisory Systems
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2011
Operators of power grid supervisory control systems have to gather information from a wide variety of views to build situation awareness. Findings from a conducted field study show that this task is challenging and cognitively demanding. Visualization research for power grid supervisory control systems has focused on developing new visualization techniques for representing one aspect of the power system data. Little work has been done to demonstrate how information visualization techniques can support the operator in the sense making process to achieve situation awareness. To fill this gap, and with support from a field study, we propose solutions based on multiple and coordinated views, visual interactive filtering and parallel coordinates.

The evolution of mobile devices, especially the integration of sensors, is fostering the development of context aware visualization applications. The adaptation to usage contexts is crucial to overcome the diverse limitations that exist in a mobile device, namely the screen size. However, most of the currently develop applications focus on specific contexts. In this paper we propose an adaptive visualization framework that has the goal of enabling the development of applications that use a diverse set of contexts and adaptation methods.

2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
The successful collaboration and interoperability between fully and partially related E-government subject domains requires well understood and high quality definitions of terms and a unified view of the relationships between the defined terms. The common terms and corresponding relation are defined in knowledge taxonomies (or even ontologies) and several good tools exist to create and maintain these models for the appropriate sub domains. The engineering process is carried out in a multi-user environment including remote workers editing the taxonomy. However, the sheer complexity and size of the full models dictates more powerful and dedicated visualization tools to graphically inspect, assess and diagnose the full taxonomies. This article describes a case where a social network analysis (SNA) tool is used as a part of a regime for the quality assurance of a knowledge taxonomy for e-government interoperability. In addition to the visual aids provided by the SNA tool, some comments are also made as to the applicability of SNA centrality metrics to knowledge taxonomies.

None
2011
Extended Linguistic Dependency Diagrams are an innovative visualization of a data structure that is increasingly important in linguistics and language studies. It uses standard Info V is techniques in ways new to linguistic diagrams to encode more information than is possible with previous visualizations. The goal is to make the diagrams easier to use, by allowing easier identification of the parts of the diagram of interest to the user. In addition, we aim to construct reusable tools to aid in language analysis and study. Preliminary evaluation supports the validity of the approach and suggests further improvements.

In today's information systems, strategies for decision making and accurate results in a short time are crucial in many knowledge areas of industry, economic, medical etc.. To support this demand to store and interpret relevant information, the area of information visualization coupled with several others, such as intelligent systems and data mining, is increasingly taking place in academic research and market. Aiming to increase to level of interaction and accurate results, this article presents a collaborative augmented reality application for information visualization support.

2011
In recent years, music-finding services have been increasing. If we have explicit information specifying pieces of music, we can find music to our taste using such services. This paper describes a tool to support music discovery. The tool visualizes a relational structure among music genres and the music-preference data of many listeners to make the users aware of their favorite music without explicit information. A case study is described to illustrate the usefulness of the tool.

Comparing Static Gantt and Mosaic Charts for Visualization of Task Schedules
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
A mosaic chart has been proposed for representation of events on a timeline. While early studies demonstrated the effectiveness of mosaics in supporting visualization of multimedia records on a meeting browser, the usability of mosaics as a static timeline visualization has not been studied in more general settings. This paper investigates the use of the mosaic charts for visualization of project schedules. A user study was conducted to compare a building project schedule encoded alternatively as a mosaic or as a Gantt chart. Although the study focused on static graphs, for which the Gantt technique is usually very effective, results showed that the users were as fast and accurate at answering the questions using the mosaic representation as they were using Gantt charts. The analysis and experiment indicated algorithmic, space-filling and interpretation limitations of the mosaic technique. We suggest possible design improvements to overcome some of these limitations.

Analyzing Soccer Goalkeeper Performance Using a Metaphor-Based Visualization
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
The dimensionality of soccer statistics relating to goalkeeper specific data can be difficult to interpret. Leveraging our existing statistical analytics tool, Soccer Scoop, we developed a goalkeeper visualization add-on that can assist a team manager. With the newly developed goalkeeper visualization tool, a team manager can compare a single goalkeeper between two games, measure the overall performance of the goalkeeper both for games played at home or away, as well as to devise the appropriate training exercises needed to strengthen any visible weakness. To keep with the continuity of the visualization styles of our first tool, Soccer Scoop, the goalkeeper visualization applies similar techniques, such as glyphs, details on demand, color, and Gestalt principles.

Exploratory to Presentation Visualization, and Everything In-between: Providing Flexibility in Aesthetics, Interactions and Visual Layering
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
It is often necessary to perform exploratory analysis on datasets in order to determine the patterns to show as presentation visualizations for a target audience. In many cases, exploratory packages do not offer enough flexibility to alter application look and feel in order to produce the required presentations of the data. Runtime modifications of aesthetic, interactive and visualization layering properties allow new interfaces to be defined that can best suit a target audience. Modifications to these properties allow advanced exploratory systems to be reduced down to limited presentation visualizations, and everything in between. This paper explores the design and applications of such runtime application flexibility within the web-based visualization environment Weave.

Moving from Folksonomies to Taxonomies: Using the Social Web and 3D to Build an Unlimited Semantic Ontology
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
The Semantic Web was introduced in 1999 as a method of interrelating information to help computers derive conclusions based on the links between data. With the rising popularity of Social Networks though, unconnected pieces of information have only chaotically increased instead of becoming parts of well-organised Taxonomies. In this paper, we suggest a system which will take advantage of the Social Web and put it to work so that it will operate under the common cause of categorising old and new data into an unlimited Semantic Ontology. This ontology will be created gradually and ever-changing, like a versatile encyclopaedia of information compiled from interconnected data. With the addition of a 3D Web interface on top of the ontology management mechanisms, the entire experience will become more user friendly, providing graphical presentation of all opinions and interpretations in a clear and comparable manner.

The Fractal Perspective Visualization Technique for Semantic Networks
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
We introduce a novel interactive visualization technique for semantic networks supporting continuous semantic graph browsing. Our visual semantic graph representation is a nested object visualization representing a view into the graph from a node's viewpoint. In this view, panning and zooming interactions drive graph traversal. We call the visualization technique Fractal Perspective, because it has approximate fractal structure (self similarity at multiple scales) and represents a kind of "perspective projection" from graph space to display space in which distant objects (in graph space) appear smaller (in a dynamic display space). This is work in progress, and this paper should be considered primarily a concept paper with a brief description of a very early prototype harnessing multi-touch interaction.

Important genes may flux among bacteria by horizontal transfer and trigger substantial evolutionary changes. Novel genome linguistic and visualization approaches helped to identify genomic islands in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and trace their origin down to alpha-Proteobacteria. The identified genomic islands are distinctive from prophage inserts common for Mycobacteria. Donor-recipient relationships were visualized for the analysis on a two-dimensional map. A database of genomic islands found in bacterial chromosomes has been created and it is freely available on-line at http://anjie.bi.up.ac.za/geidb/geidb-home.php.

Adaptive Visual Symbols for Personal Health Records

2011
As a hub of information controlled by the patient, personal health records (PHR) collect information from the patient medical history including a wide variety of data sources as patient's observations, lab results, clinical findings and in the future maybe even personal genetic data and automatic recordings from monitoring devices. This development will on the one hand make health care more personalized and user controlled but on the other hand also overloads consumers with a huge amount of data. To address this issue we developed a framework for adaptive visual symbols (AVS). An AVS can adapt its appearance and level of detail during the communication process. Finally we demonstrate the AVS principle for the visualization of personal health records.

Interactive Drug Design in Virtual Reality

None
2011
Discovering new drugs for emerging diseases has been a challenging task. There are numerous drug design techniques including fragment-based and diversity-oriented methods but their accuracies and efficiencies are low. By incorporating visualisation, biomedical experts can interact with the process to produce drug-like ligands more efficiently. The paper presents an interactive drug design algorithm which generates lead candidates against a protein. A set of drug candidates, created by an in house fragment-based method and docked on the target protein, are visualised in the virtual reality settings. Biomedical experts can investigate and select some of the ligands for further processing, aided with distance and bonding information. It also assists the user to drag and rotate the ligand to the binding site they find suitable. The algorithm runs iteratively and improves the quality of lead candidates every step. The paper compares the quality of resulting ligands between interactive and automatic approaches.

Characterization of Atherosclerosis Plaque in OCT Images Using Texture Analysis and Parametric Equations
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
It has been long thought that the main cause of a heart attack is the narrowing of an artery from the buildup of fatty plaque inside the artery wall. Postmortem autopsy studies on patients who have died after a myocardial infarction (heart attack) found that many of those did not have their arteries severely narrowed by plaque. Instead, thrombosis (blood clots)near ruptured lesions were identified as the actual main cause. The search for the type of culprit lesions has established that the formation of a lipid-rich pool covered by a thin fibrous cap(thickness less than 65 micrometer) was structurally unstable and likely to rupture. Subsequently, the term vulnerable plaque has been used to refer to this type of plaque. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a new imaging modality capable of providing the required micrometer scale resolution to detect such tissue. With a resolution of approximately15 micrometer, OCT is considered the most promising imaging modality for identifying vulnerable plaque. We present a complete framework for reliable tissue characterization of different plaque types using OCT images. Our framework utilizes texture analysis as delineating features. In addition, a parametric classification technique is presented. The characterization performance of the proposed framework is assessed and evaluated.

Analysis of high-dimensional micro array expression data is based mostly on the statistical approaches that are indispensable for the study of biological systems. To aid the analysis and exploration of such data, the process of analyzing such data is often enhanced with visual, data mining and other computational techniques. We utilize a set of tools for the visual analysis of data aimed at generating the hypotheses. We show the usability of classic and novel multi-dimensional visualization tools in life sciences. Additionally, we survey and show several multidimensional visualization tools applied to the process of data exploration using a urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder time course. These tools have the potential of uncovering non-trivial relationships and structures in the data.

Recent research in genomics and biomedical studies has shown a relationship between heredity, mutations in certain genes and the corresponding probabilities of developing certain cancers. In this study we looked at breast and ovarian cancer distributions across all states and counties in the United States over time. We describe briefly Weave, our Web-based Analysis and Visualization Environment and use it to explore these cancers and present interactive animated visualizations of family hereditary patterns and genetic distributions, not only for these cancers, but also for other life-threatening cancers and related health indicators. We also show how Weave can be used to integrate other diverse epidemiological data, in particular obesity, and explore its relationship with cancer data.

Coviz is a tool that uses visualization to support spontaneous construction, organization and exploration of collections. We use the term collection to identify a set of documents gathered for a given purpose by one or several individuals. Coviz facilitates creation, organization and update of collections by providing multi-scale visualization and interaction techniques. Coviz has been tested in several informative case studies involving small groups of users. In these situations, Coviz has fulfilled several important aspects of both groups and personal organization needs. Our initial experiments indicate that Coviz can even encourage unusual and interesting forms of cooperation among people.

Extracting and Visualising Tree-like Structures from Concept Lattices
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Traditional software in Formal Concept Analysis makes little use of visualization techniques, producing poorly readable concept lattice representations when the number of concepts exceeds a few dozens. This is problematic as the number of concepts in such lattices grows significantly with the size of the data and the number of its dimensions. In this work we propose several methods to enhance the readability of concept lattices firstly though colouring and distortion techniques, and secondly by extracting and visualizing trees derived from concept lattice structures. These contributions represent an important step in the visual analysis of conceptual structures, as domain experts may visually explore larger datasets that traditional visualizations of concept lattice cannot represent effectively.

Nugget Browser: Visual Subgroup Mining and Statistical Significance Discovery in Multivariate Datasets

2011
Discovering interesting patterns in datasets is a very important data mining task. Subgroup patterns are local findings identifying the subgroups of a population with some unusual, unexpected, or deviating distribution of a target attribute. However, this pattern discovery task poses several compelling challenges. First, computational data mining techniques can generally only discover and extract pre-defined patterns. Second, since the extracted patterns are typically multi-dimensional arbitrary-shaped regions, it is very difficult to convey in an easily interpretable manner. Finally, in order to assist analysts in exploring their discoveries and understanding the relationships among patterns, as well as connections between patterns and the underlying data instances, an integrated visualization system is greatly needed. In this paper, we present a novel subgroup pattern extraction and visualization system, called the Nugget Browser, that takes advantage of both data mining methods and interactive visual exploration. The system accepts analysts' mining queries interactively, converts the query results into an understandable form, builds visual representations, and supports navigation and exploration for further analyses.

Using Visual Analysis to Weight Multiple Signatures to Discriminate Complex Data
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Complex data is usually represented through signatures, which are sets of features describing the data content. Several kinds of complex data allow extracting different signatures from an object, representing complementary data characteristics. However, there is no ground truth of how balancing these signatures to reach an ideal similarity distribution. It depends on the analyst intent, that is, according to the job he/she is performing, a few signatures should have more impact in the data distribution than others. This work presents a new technique, called Visual Signature Weighting (ViSW), which allows interactively analyzing the impact of each signature in the similarity of complex data represented through multiple signatures. Our method provides means to explore the tradeoff of prioritizing signatures over the others, by dynamically changing their weight relation. We also present case studies showing that the technique is useful for global dataset analysis as well as for inspecting subspaces of interest.

The task of automated object tracking and performance assessment in low frame rate, persistent, wide spatial coverage motion imagery is an emerging research domain. The collection of hundreds to tens of thousands of dense trajectories produced by such automatic algorithms along with the subset of manually verified tracks across several coordinate systems require new tools for effective human computer interfaces and exploratory trajectory visualization. We describe an interactive visualization system that supports very large gig pixel per frame video, facilitates rapid, intuitive monitoring and analysis of tracking algorithm execution, provides visual methods for the inter comparison of very long manual tracks with multi segmented automatic tracker outputs, and a flexible KOLAM Tracking Simulator (KOLAM-TS) middleware that generates visualization data by automating the object tracker performance testing and benchmarking process.

Information Visualization in Climate Research

2011
Much of the work conducted in climate research involves large and heterogeneous datasets with spatial and temporal references. This makes climate research an interesting application area for visualization. However, the application of interactive visual methods to assist in gaining insight into climate data is still hampered for climate research scientists, who are usually not visualization experts. In this paper, we report on a survey that we conducted to evaluate the application of interactive visualization methods and to identify the problems related to establishing such methods in scientific practice. The feedback from 76 participants shows clearly that state-of-the-art techniques are rarely applied and that integrating existing solutions smoothly into the scientists workflow is problematic. We have begun to change this and present first results that illustrate how interactive visualization tools can be successfully applied to accomplish climate research tasks. As a concrete example, we describe the visualization of climate networks and its benefits for climate impact research.

Today weather forecasts assist in the preparation of roads during the winter season to avoid accidents resulting from snow, rain and slipperiness. As with any weather forecast there is always a search for improvement. One way to do this is by verifying the forecasted parameters with the actual weather observed in the forecasted area. To facilitate identification of significant trends and patterns within weather data we have developed an application based on interactive information visualization techniques. The application was created in close collaboration with domain experts from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute and initial feedback from a performed user study shows that interactive visualization speeds up the analysis process as well as increases flexibility compared to currently used manual methods.

Using Visualization for Exploring Relationships between Concepts in Ontologies
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Usually, ontologies are represented as static 2D graphs, being the relationships exhibited as overlapping edges, which may cause a cognitive overload. On the other hand, 3D representations can also lead to confusion in terms of navigation due to occlusion. Moreover, as the ontologies grow, incorporating new concepts (and their relationships), the visualization complexity increases either in 2D or in 3D. In this paper, we discuss a visualization tool for exploring relationships between ontology concepts. We employ linked tree structures that capture the hierarchical feature of parts of the ontology while preserving the different categories of relationships between concepts. Ontologies are displayed as trees on a plane, representing only the hierarchical relationships between concepts, allowing the user to explore other connections by creating projections of nodes (concepts) in another plane and linking them according to the relationships to be analyzed.

A Knowledge Visualization of Database Content Created by a Database Taxonomy
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
The synergy between information visualization and knowledge visualization is explored using the "DatabaseTaxonomy" to guide the way. Drawing extensively on Burgin's mathematical theory of named sets, this new knowledge visualization treats all database content as ifit were scientific data, regardless of the database application. This mathematical tool penetrates deep into the logical structure of data and data relations, enabling a single algorithm to generate a conceptual knowledge structure, which pre-structures raw data in the database into a list of nested data-topic lists that works like a book index. For end-users, this visualization is familiar, convenient and precise. For the research community, this knowledge structure and the techniques used to build it offer an empirical tool for investigating the underlying properties of data, information, and knowledge on a computing device. The transformation from data to information to knowledge is automatic and seamless, thanks to a novel analysis of the logical structure of the symbols on these mechanical devices, one which reveals meta-symbols consisting of physical values(v) and constructed-types (t). The Database Taxonomy also provides a first glimpse into how navigating this structure can generate a predicate logic expression, an outcome which the author believes promises to advance our theoretical understanding of knowledge visualization and of the influence of a digital media on symbolic logic.

In the crafting of commercial contracts, many participants are involved, often professionals from different countries and backgrounds. The challenge, then, is to achieve a balance between the business and legal requirements and to facilitate communication and coordination. While some contracts may need to work as evidence in court, most contracts do not. Instead, they need to work as business tools for the parties so they get the results they want to accomplish. This paper presents preliminary observations of research work in progress, aimed at developing new methods to improve the clarity and usability of commercial contracts. It proposes a new field of research and practice, contract visualization, and invites cross-professional dialogue to explore the opportunities that exist for industry-changing innovations in this area.

Listening to Managers: A Study about Visualizations in Corporate Presentations
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
This paper presents a study about the use of visualizations in corporate presentations. We interviewed nine executive managers of a leading technology company about how they create business presentations for different meetings and different audiences. Thereby, we focused on which visualization types they normally use and whether they would accept new forms of visualizations such as information graphics, which are currently very popular. Due to the explorative character of the study, we used the grounded theory approach. Results show that design principles or effective visualizations are not known to the most interviewees. The interviewees rated corporate design, use of master layout, and templates higher than individually designed slides. The most popular visualization types managers use in presentations are bar and pie charts. The term "information graphic" was not known.

What is an Effective Knowledge Visualization? Insights from a Review of Seminal Concepts
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
The domain of knowledge visualization is a relatively young discipline that focuses on the collaborative use of interactive graphics to create, integrate and apply knowledge. This emerging approach nevertheless builds on decades of research on using images collaboratively for sense making and knowledge sharing. In this paper, we review seminal concepts from different disciplines that help to explain how visualizations can effectively act as collaboration catalysts and knowledge integrators. Our review makes it apparent that many different labels and conceptions exist in very different domains to explain the same phenomenon: the integrative power of visuals for knowledge-intensive collaboration processes. These concepts can be used to compile a list of the requirements of an effective knowledge visualization. We conclude the paper by showing the theoretical and practical implications of this review.

Visualizing Service Contracts -- The Case of an Equipment Manufacturer
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
This paper presents the case of an industrial equipment manufacturer facing the challenge of selling services. The main source for confusion was the complexity of the services and the multiplicity of options offered to the customers. It was hard to have a clear picture of what entitlements or responsibilities followed from the choices, and draft a contract accordingly. The company decided to try visualization to facilitate communication and to clarify the service content. The experiment provided valuable insight into the possibilities and limitations of contract visualization in the context of industrial service contracts. The conclusion was that visuals can help but are not the answer to all communication problems. It is for example essential to fit the visual content to the targeted audience and to make sure that the text that is going to be visualized is understood correctly in the first place.

The Effectiveness of Knowledge Visualization for Organizational Communication in Europe and India
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
In recent years we are witnessing a growing interest and use of knowledge visualization for communicating ideas and insights. Companies are deploying diagrams and knowledge maps to convey crucial business concepts. Scholars are reporting successful company cases, theorizing on the topic and compiling classifications and best practices. Yet few studies have attempted to prove the effectiveness of visualization, nor have they based their hypotheses on theories with predictive power. We aim to provide a contribution for the advancement of the field of knowledge visualization by testing the effects of different visualizations on the attitude toward its content. Second, we assess if visualization effectiveness is universal or culturally-bounded. We have conducted an experimental study, comparing text and two knowledge visualization types. The results of 231 subjects in Europe and India demonstrate that knowledge visualization has the power to increase the effectives of the message compared to text, and that these benefits replicate across different cultures.

Knowledge Visualization in Qualitative Methods -- Or How Can I See What I Say?
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
In several research fields, qualitative interviewing(i.e., face-to-face individual interviews and focus groups) is an essential approach to gather high-quality, and deep data about a wide range of subjective experiences. Although being a well-established research method, qualitative interviewing is fraught with various shortcomings such as difficulties in initiating the interview process, in eliciting tacit knowledge and in avoiding information redundancies. In this paper, we propose the use of visual tools (e.g., visualization software) as a support to facilitate the interview process and to gather sound qualitative data. Visual representations provide structure, context and explicitness, and thus foster knowledge elicitation and sharing in interviews. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we provide a methodological extension of qualitative interviewing. Second, we suggest a practical approach to use visuals in interviews, presenting concrete examples from the research field. We conclude our paper by discussing the limitations of our approach, and by suggesting directions for future research on visualization-based interviewing.

Memory, Difference, and Information: Generative Architectures Latent to Material and Perceptual Plasticity
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Stemming from ongoing research between architecture and the biological sciences, this paper explores dynamic organizations of matter in both a multi-dimensional, microscopic scale human cellular system and a human-scaled perceptual environment from an information theoretical framework. This research examines latent virtual diagrams residing within real dynamic material systems whose generative potential emerges from difference, history, and ultimately the structural information content of spatiotemporal data arrays. Through the development of a design tool, we offer a method for visualizing the underlying formal structures of these data arrays. Currently this method is being developed and deployed in the biomedical sciences as a means of analyzing dynamic biological data sets for purposes of determining unique spatiotemporal behavioral signatures in different cell types within unique cellular environments. From a design standpoint, a parallel aim of this research deploys these same information theoretical principles as an analytic technique, specifically in areas of generative design, materiality, and affect as they pertain to organizations of data arrays generated from objects within their environments with and without perceiving subjects, or what we call relative observers.

Practice of Using Virtual Reconstruction in the Restoration of Monumental Painting of the Church of the Transfiguration of Our Saviour on Nereditsa Hill
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
There are many architectural monuments and old relics, the restoration of which is an unrealizable task. This may be due to the great amount of hard work to be done, complexity of the work, lack of information about the object and other reasons. In such cases, the virtual reconstruction is an effective tool. Saint-Petersburg State University developed a method of restoration of partially or completely lost monumental paintings. As an example and a practical application of new technology there was completed the virtual reconstruction of fresco paintings of the Church of the Transfiguration of Our Savior on Nereditsa Hill. The church was almost completely destroyed during the Second World War. It appeared to be possible to reconstruct an architectural view of the church according to the old drawings, but rare frescos of the XIIth century had been irretrievably lost. The extant parts of frescoes consist of 325,000 pieces. Although they are being on restoration now, but this work is still far from completion. In this case the method of computer-based reconstruction is much more efficient, it helps us to avoid mistakes and find a compromise decision on the issue of reconstruction or restoration of the object. As a result of the project, a fairly accurate reconstruction of the object has been produced and a method of reconstruction of the lost fresco painting has been developed. The basis and sources of virtual reconstruction were archaeological materials, archival and contemporary historical, architectural and art papers, scientific research in this field. In the process of virtual reconstruction there were used two main methods: a technology of computer graphics as well as analog pictorial reconstruction. The first method makes it possible to complete the work of reconstruction with complete fidelity, whereas the second method helps us to convey the artist's style, to reproduce the form, direction and strength of the artist's touch and texture of the frescos. The results of the project can be used for further practical work for the restoration of the object. The methodology, developed by authors of the project, may open new possibilities for the restoration of other fresco ensembles.

None
2011
This paper considers the deep history of tables as visualization modalities. It covers four kinds of tables that have appeared between 1900 BCE and 1300 CE: Sumerian accounting tables, chronicles, canon tables, and medieval calendars as representations of some of the earliest milestones in information visualization. Analysis of these tables demonstrates as early as 1300 BCE the need to visualize information had driven the invention of representations that transformed the way information has been communicated and used.

One challenge for the global market is to overcome communication problems of different kinds. The largest communication problem is language, people speak different languages and have limited knowledge in other languages. This problem is central in manuals and instructions for assembly and installations. One hopeful solution is that pictures can replace verbal instructions. In this paper we will discuss how illustrations in flat perspective can be useful for showing action in drawings.

The Implications of David Hockney's Thesis for 3D Computer Graphics
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
David Hockney's 2001 book Secret Knowledge of the Masters, reignited the debate on the use of optical devices for constructing perspective images in the Renaissance. In it, he brings his insights as an artist to the debate. This paper explores his thesis in terms of its implications for 3D computer graphics. Just as technology informed the Renaissance artist on ways of seeing and representing natural phenomena, 3D computer graphics today uses algorithms to simulate these same phenomena. For both, various techniques are used to make the images produced seem real or at least real enough. In the case of the Renaissance artist, painterly techniques were used to generate the illusion of clarity. For 3D computer graphics, mathematical algorithms are used to simulate many of the same effects. Striving for realism is a common theme. However, while the Renaissance artist never lost site of their role in interpreting what they see, 3D computer graphics is supposed to be underpinned by the certainties of its apparent scientific veracity. But is this certainty deserved or is it merely that science and art are intertwined in ways that mean one is reliant on the other?

Sculpture Meets Ecological Science: Marijana Tadic's Wandering Albatross Exhibitions and the Concept of Philopatry
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
The concept of philopatry is most often applied to animal, bird and insect populations. As such, it is closely connected to the disciplines of zoology, animal science, behavioural ecology and non-human genetics. Only rarely (in reality, almost never) is this concept deployed in relation to human population movement. Yet, as a result of colonisation, globalisation, intermarriage, wars, political unrest and other diasporic forces, increasing numbers of migrants and asylum seekers now settle in places far away from their countries of birth. Travel, often involving long distances back and forth between people's adoptive and natal homelands, and frequently taking place on a repetitive, seasonal, basis, has become a significant contemporary phenomenon. In the Yugoslav-born, Australian conceptual sculptor Marijana Tadic's recent installation and sculptural exhibitions, collectively titled Wandering Albatross, exhibited in South Australia February-March 2011, the artist has appropriated the concept of philopatry, applying it to ideas about contemporary patterns of migrancy with thrilling conceptual and aesthetic results.

Colorscore -- Visualization and Condensation of Structure of Classical Music
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
It is not always easy to quickly understand musical structure of orchestral scores for classical music works, because these works contain many staves of instruments. This paper presents Color score, a technique for visualization and condensation of musical scores. Color score supports two requirements for composers, arrangers and players: overview and arrangement. Color score divides each track of the score into note-blocks, and determines their roles. Color score then displays all the note-blocks in one display space to provide the overview, so that novice people can quickly understand the musical structures. In addition, Color score supports vertical condensation which reduces the number of displayed tracks, and horizontal condensation which saves the display space. It is especially useful as hints to rearrange music for smaller bands.

We often want to select tunes based on our purposes or situations. For example, we may want background music for particular spaces. We think interactive evolutionary computing is a good solution to adequately recommend tunes based on users' preferences. This paper presents MusiCube, a visual interface for music selection. It applies interactive genetic algorithm in a multi-dimensional musical feature space. MusiCube displays a set of tunes as colored icons in a 2D cubic space, and provides a user interface to intuitively select suggested tunes. This paper presents a user experience that MusiCube adequately represented clouds of icons corresponding to sets of users' preferable tunes in the 2D cubic space.

It is not very intuitive to manipulate objects visualized in 3-dimension by a mouse, because a mouse can only move in 2-dimension space. We propose an interaction technique to manipulate 3D objects by mobile devices with acceleration sensors. We have developed a 3D molecular visualization system which displays results of a simulation of the molecular dynamics method. In the system, we can rotate 3D objects by leaning a mobile device and change a viewing location by moving a mobile device. We discuss how we implement the interaction technique in this paper.

In the realm of computer graphics, methods used to control a user's point of view in a three-dimensional world are rather convoluted and are often tightly coupled to the rendering system used. In response to this issue, we have developed a robust camera controller system that provides an intuitive interface for visualization and simulation programmers, while removing renderer dependencies completely. Our system follows common object oriented design principles to encapsulate the complex mathematics and computations involved in synthetic camera manipulation, providing a firm foundation for high-level camera features. We provide a use case where students with no graphics experience developed a visualization system using our camera controller.

None
2011
In this work, we present an interactive visual clustering approach for the exploration and analysis of datasets using the computational power of Graphics Processor Units (GPUs). The visualization is based on a collective behavioral model that enables cognitive amplification of information visualization. In this way, the workload of understanding the representation of information moves from the cognitive to the perceptual system. The results enable a more intuitive, interactive approach to the discovery of knowledge. The paper illustrates this behavioral model for clustering data, and applies it to the visualization of a number of real and synthetic datasets.

2011
We tested the visual sensitivity of 15 healthy subjects under scotopic vision using flickering stimulus on the Liquid crystal display (LCD) with a light-emitting diode (LED) backlight (LED-LCD) panel. This test was made to know; 1) if LED-LCD panel might be used for the visual stimulation under scotopic vision, and 2) the minimum trials for ensemble average to get visually evoked potential (VEP). Green, Blue, and Red colors were tested in the darkroom. Electroencephalogram electrodes were used. The brightness of each color was degraded into 255 steps. All participants were asked to watch a circle with red, green, and blue color on the LED-LCD panel. As a result, VEP showed a well-known response pattern when the signals were ensemble averaged for 50 trials. The peak of VEP was not much changed after 25 trials. LED-LCD panel was simple and useful for the simple visual stimulation to test VEP.

Digital photo painting is a newly emerging phenomenon in both fine art and everyday life. The latest versions of specialist software, such as Corel Painter or Adobe Photoshop, allow anyone to turn their selected photographs into enchanting paintings, produced in any style desired. The first book on this subject 'The Art of Digital Photo Painting' by Marilyn Sholin was published quite recently, in 2009.This paper explores the conceptual, creative and cultural aspects of turning photos into paintings using popular software and plug-ins. It argues that the mass production of original digital paintings and fine art prints may signal a new era in the relationship between photography and painting. The paper discusses why digital photo painting might be the 'next big thing' in digital art and become a new hobby for millions.

PieVis: Interactive Graph Visualization Using a Rings-Based Tree Drawing Algorithm for Children and Crust Display for Parents
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
The quality of a graph drawing algorithm is often measured by its edge crossings, angular resolution, aspect ratio, and node labeling. Algorithms for drawing trees in general are segregated from algorithms for drawing graphs. In this paper we present a graph visualization system that uses a novel interconnection between a tree drawing algorithm and graph drawing techniques. First, the graph is transformed into a tree and nodes that have multiple parent connections within the graph are duplicated within the tree. While some of the connection information is lost during this transformation, the multiple connections can be regained by interactively displaying the details based on the degree of interest. We use an edgeless rings-based visualization which allows edge crossings and angular resolution issues to be eliminated and has a desirable aspect ratio of 1. Finally, a circular labeling method is used that provides user-friendly labels that do not overlap and clearly show node affiliation.

Improving the Evaluation Performance of Space-Time Trellis Code through Visualisation

2011
In this paper we present a new visualisation approach in the effort of improving the evaluation strategy of space-time trellis code (STTC) generator matrix G. To our knowledge, although visualisation is widely used to handle a variety of problems, it has never been employed specifically to solve complexity problems that are related to generator matrix G evaluation. Most approaches are either mathematically or algorithmically inclined. As such, they tend to offer a series of refinement that enhances the current available method, but do not provide fresh insight on the problem at hand. By comparing it with the enhancement strategy that was discovered via the normal approach (i.e., by analysing algorithm) it was discovered that visualisation had inspired an entirely different pruning technique that outperformed the common approach by 20%.

Edge Routing and Bundling for Graphs with Fixed Node Positions
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
In some graph drawing scenarios, the positions of the nodes are already defined and cannot be modified (for example, they were provided by the user) and the graph drawing techniques are only used to draw edges between the nodes. The number of nodes in such cases tends to be relatively small (tens or hundreds of nodes at most) however the users want to see all of the edges. Various edge routing techniques can provide such services, but if the graph is dense, the drawing can get rather hard to read due to the high number of lines required to visualize the edges. In such cases, clarity can be improved by bundling individual edges (more precisely parts of their drawing) into larger groups and draw as a single line. In this paper, we provide several different techniques for edge bundling based on an edge routing algorithm, compare and evaluate them.

Node-attribute Graph Layout for Small-World Networks

2011
Small-world networks are a very commonly occurring type of graph in the real-world, which exhibit a clustered structure that is not well represented by current graph layout algorithms. In many cases we also have information about the nodes in such graphs, which are typically depicted on the graph as node colour, shape or size. Here we demonstrate that these attributes can instead be used to layout the graph in high-dimensional data space. Then using a dimension reduction technique, targeted projection pursuit, the graph layout can be optimised for displaying clustering. The technique out-performs force-directed layout methods in cluster separation when applied to a sample, artificially generated, small-world network.

Using the Gestalt Principle of Closure to Alleviate the Edge Crossing Problem in Graph Drawings
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Graphs, generally used as data structures in computer science applications, have steadily shown a growth in mapping various types of relationships, from maps to computer networks to social networks. As graph layouts and visualizations have been at the forefront of graph drawing research for decades, it consequently led to aesthetic heuristics that not only generated better visualizations and aesthetically appealing graphs but also improved readability and understanding of the graphs. A variety of approaches examines aesthetics of nodes, edges, or graph layout, and related readability metrics. In this paper we focus on the edge crossing problem and propose a solution that incorporates Gestalt principles to improve graph aesthetics and readability. We introduce the concept of breaks in edges at edge crossings. A break is a gap in an edge drawing occurring in the vicinity of an edge crossing. At every edge crossing, one of the incident edges is broken, which will prevent any unintentional Gestalts that occur at edge crossings that reduce the readability of a graph drawing. We present our preliminary results and user studies that show that this technique could play a role in improving graph readability.

Growing B-spline model of curve approximation exploits local control of B-spline which leads to efficient approximation of complex curves, even with higher order B-splines. Approximation is carried out progressively (growing) in this model which is another factor for efficient approximation. Control points are adjusted / re-positioned in each iteration of approximation based on error between two curves. Proposed method can avoid any need of parameterization and complex computations. Proposed growing model can be applied with any degree of B-spline curve.

Evaluation of Volumetric Medical Images Segmentation Using Hidden Markov Random Field Model

Medical image segmentation is a crucial step in the process of image analysis. An automatic aid in interpretation of huge amount of data can be of great value to specialists that hold final decision. Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) Model and Gibbs distributions provide powerful tools for image modeling. In this paper, we use a HMRF model to perform segmentation of volumetric medical images handling inter-image similarity. This modelling leads to the minimization of an energy function. This problem is computationally intractable. Therefore, optimizations techniques are used to compute a solution. We will use and compare promising relatively recent methods based on graph cuts with older well known methods that are Simulated Annealing and ICM.

Efficient Curvature-optimized G2-continuous Path Generation with Guaranteed Error Bound for 3-axis Machining
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Path generations are a necessary integral part of any automated machining approach using 3-axis robots. Given an input path in form of a piecewise linear curve, we automatically generate an optimized path that lies within a given error bound or tolerance band of the input path. The optimization is targeted at minimizing the processing time of the machining process. As sharp turns require the robot to slow down, we want to minimize the local curvature at each point of the curve. Our approach is an efficient offline algorithm that consists of several processing steps. Ina preprocessing step, we analyze the input path and split it into small groups. The groups are categorized and can be handled independently and locally. We apply a local sleeve concept for complicated groups and a local Bezierapproximation for simple groups. In a post processing step the groups are combined to form a G2-continuous path. Our approach achieves high-quality results that are comparable to the sleeves approach while being significantly more efficient (speed-up of one order of magnitude) when applied to real-world problems.

Data Visualization Using Shape Preserving C2 Rational Spline
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
A rational cubic spline is developed to provide smooth curves(positive, monotone and convex). To control the shape of the curve, two families of parameters are introduced in its representation. Three schemes using rational cubic spline are elaborated to obtain positive curves through positive data, monotone curves through monotone data and convex curves through convex data. As well as degree of smoothness attained is C2.

A Hybrid Scheme Coding Using SPHIT and Fractal for Mammography Image Compression
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Medical imaging techniques produce very large amounts of data, that have to be transmitted or stored, and therefore, there is a need for image compression. Fractal image compression still suffers from a high encoding time. We propose a new optimization approach to reduce the time of fractal image encoding. This approach is a hybridization of the SPIHT algorithm and Jacquin-style coding scheme. Our approach was tested on mammography images of MIAS database.

Summarization and Visualization of Pedestrian Tracking Data
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
We present a summarization and visualization technique for large-scale traffic path data. The research aims to visually distinguish the amount of similar traffic, by representing the similar traffic as bundles of lines. Our technique firstly quantizes the collection of paths, then categorizes the segmented paths, and finally renders the bundles of the segments. Our implementation also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interactively explore the various types of data, so that they can adjust the degree of summarization by controlling parameters in the GUI. The technique can visualize various kinds of path data recorded as chronologically ordered positions which form sequential segments, acquired from movies, sensors, and computer simulations. One of the features of the technique is that it can effectively visualize paths in the place where there are not expressly constructed ways. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the technique by applying it to two types of path data, where one is acquired by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors, and the other is extracted from a movie.

Users' Responses to 2D and 3D Visualization Techniques in Urban Conservation Process
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
This paper compares efficiency of two and three-dimensional visualization techniques which are developed for representation of spatial content of an urban historic site. The aim of this paper is to measure users' perception regarding the performance of these visualization techniques. Methodology is based on a questionnaire which is gathering the user's responses regarding comprehension and perception level of the case area's characteristics. The case study, which was held in Zeyrek urban historic site, comprises the application of 2D and 3D figures and schemes in order to represent the site characteristics, survey and analysis and proposals. As the fundamental finding of the study, it is concluded that spatial attributes and characteristics in 3D urban models are better defined than in 2D mapping technique. The study indicates that orientation sense of users and cognition of the townscape characteristics are the most prominent components of 3D urban model, generated within this case study.

Optimized Work Flow through VR and AR Technology on Construction Sites
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
The development of a physical building control center can support project management and -control to optimize the flow of the complex processes at a construction site. The concept consists of equipping vehicles with sensors and using VR and AR-techniques to visualize this real time information and allow an optical adaption to current circumstances. The result will be shown by a more efficient utilization and enhanced cost effectiveness. To analyse what is required you always start by clarifying the relevant object to be presented in VR. The instrument chosen was interview. The second step is to work out the necessary way of computing, viewing and manipulating this data. Finally a hardware setting is designed that would probably fulfill the derived requirements. The results of the interviews are presented. By processing these data the information and objects, which shall be visualized within the use case of a control center as well as in an on-site use case, are elaborated and also introduced. For these reasons hardware settings are analyzed and the basis for an implementation is established.

Some Drivers towards 3D Digital Master-Plan Visualisation in the UK
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Master-planning in general, more particularly 3Dinterpretative visualisation of Master-plans, has not been the norm in the UK planning process. However the advent of the new Localism Bill, proceeding through the UK parliament, gives some indication that these will become much more common in English practice. It is argued that English planning departments will need to move towards implementing 3D Planning constraint exploration tools and standards for which they have little experience. In German planning in particular there have been many initiatives that point the way towards standards for master plan visualisation. SmartCodes in the US indicate a similar approach for regulatory checking. The Localism Bill is likely also to require substantial inclusive consultation and collaboration with neighbourhood groups. Tools for inclusive collaborative engagement were trialled in the VEPs Interreg IIIB project. This paper predicts that the combination of these or similar approaches will become necessary to cope with the demand.

Trust and Risk in Collaborative Environments
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Many commentators and analysts are now saying that we are reaching the tipping moment in the adoption of building information modelling. By this they mean that the uphill struggle for implementation is finally falling into place and that it is beginning to gather its own momentum. This is to be welcomed. But the construction industry is very fragmented and how implementation can be accomplished is appearing sluggish. Certain drivers like owners and developers are beginning to have an impact while others like architects and planners remain somewhat listless. How to manage this risk, engender trust and make worthwhile collaboration can be helped with rated 'levels of detail' and calibrated 'metadata'.

Investigation and Research of Ancient Book Layout Culture on Chinese Sutras Edition -- A Case Study on the "Jiaxing Tripitaka" Formation
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
The case study in this research adopts the interpretation editions of Zibu (Philosophy Section) of Complete Library of the Four Treasures of Knowledge of Volume633, block-print edition of an ancient Buddhism scripture of Sutra Hall of Zhongdian of "Jiaxing Kuramoto" collections of National Library circulating from the regime of Emperor Wanli of Ming Dynasty to early Ching Dynasty. This research was conducted in essays derived from the comparison of documents. The focus is on the investigation of formation from modern design layout editing elements. With researches on Edition Study and related fields as a basis, we've reached quantity statistics in the form of character alignment through actual observation, arrangement and documentation. We intended to come up with a principle of regularity for the formation of the Jiaxing Tripitaka engraved Sutras through the relationship between title of volume and arrangement in the formation. Below are research result: 1.) scripture title, names of translators, sub-title, the First Line of Article, the second line of article. It has been found this research that: the denomination principle was that the first character of the volume was used as the first character of the volume title and the first character of the first line of first page of each of 214 scripture contents were used as the initial character of subject titles. 2.) For translator names in 28 books, related names for each writing were presented in one line. Characters of the whole paragraph in 56 books were all aligned to the lower line of the bottom column with a space of one word laid up above. Translator names in 241 books were engraved in front of sub-titles. Most sub-title characters reached the top cell. As for the first and second lines of articles, most of them also reached the top cell.

2011
This paper describes the integration of various kinds of historical and geographic information about place-naming and immigration. Information about space, place names and cultural meanings is usually disparate and fragmented in location and time. The digital resource described in this paper addresses this fragmentation by providing an interface that is both searchable and navigable. As a pilot study, it presents a rich visualisation of Irish migration and heritage within the Australian landscape and history. The resource will be used as a foundation structure for the digital collation of other cultures and migrations, internationally. It has proven to be useful for researchers from a variety of disciplines.

The Contemporisation of Dante's Inferno
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
This paper discusses the contemporisation of Dante's Inferno. It attempts to highlight the role of contemporary media in recasting this culturally significant work in a new light. More accessible to the current generation in the form of a computer game, the contemporisation of Dante's Inferno loses none of its impact and meaning. More than this, the game facilitates the search for a virtual soul-space previously reserved only for those vested with the 'given powers' (in Medieval times and prior). In this sense, the contemporisation of the Inferno also brings with it much of the mythological intensity it once sought.

Mediation of Knowledge Construction of Historic Sites through Embodied Interaction
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
This paper focuses upon the reframing of cultural heritage as bodily experience articulated through narrative based media. The concept of mediation is introduced and explored, as a knowledge intensive process that integrates the production and construction of information interfaces. Such interfaces are negotiated through, and translated by, bodily interaction and bodily reasoning. As such, the mediation process is shaped through the reformulation of kineasthetic, somatic and embodied experiences, that both, customize the interaction process, and shape the resultant outputs that effect construction of knowledge. For enhancement of the mediation process, guidelines for maintaining the integrity of the mediation are discussed. The approach is demonstrated over several projects that explore these concerns through low fidelity prototypes executed in an experimental manner.

Preprocessing for Automating Early Detection of Cervical Cancer
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Uterine Cervical Cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in women worldwide. Most cases of cervical cancer can be prevented through screening programs aimed at detecting precancerous lesions. During Digital Colposcopy, colposcopic images or cervigrams are acquired in raw form. They contain specular reflections which appear as bright spots heavily saturated with white light and occur due to the presence of moisture on the uneven cervix surface and. The cervix region occupies about half of the raw cervigram image. Other parts of the image contain irrelevant information, such as equipment, frames, text and non-cervix tissues. This irrelevant information can confuse automatic identification of the tissues within the cervix. Therefore we focus on the cervical borders, so that we have a geometric boundary on the relevant image area. Our novel technique eliminates the SR, identifies the region of interest and makes the cervigram ready for segmentation algorithms.

Accelerating Tumour Growth Simulations on Many-Core Architectures: A Case Study on the Use of GPGPU within VPH
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Simulators of tumour growth can estimate the evolution of tumour volume and the quantity of various categories of cells as functions of time. However, the execution time of each simulation often takes several dozens of minutes (depending upon the dataset resolution), which clearly prevents easy interaction. The modern graphics processing unit (GPU) is not only a powerful graphics engine but also a highly parallel programmable processor featuring peak arithmetic performance and memory bandwidth that substantially outpaces its CPU counterpart. However, despite this, the GPU is little used in the context of the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH). This paper provides a case study to demonstrate the performance advantages that can be gained by using the GPU appropriately in the context of a VPH project in which the study of tumour growth is a central activity. We also analyse the algorithm performance on different modern parallel processing architectures, including multicore CPU and many-core GPU.

Medical visualisation is an indispensable means for doctors and researchers to better explore and analyse medical images. The EC-funded ContraCancrum project, which aims at more predictable tumour simulation and treatment, uses visualisation as an important tool to interactively display tumour development and tumour simulation. This paper presents CCVis - the visualisation tool in ContraCancrum - which is a Qt-based plug in of the DrEye platform. CCVis uses a unified architecture for visualisation of the patient image data and tumour simulation data. It provides axis-aligned and arbitrary slice views, is surface rendering and volume ray casting as well as time-varying visualisation of patient image series and simulation data. Statistics in tumour simulation are plotted as 2D graphs. Major extensions of the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) are made to meet the demands for label highlighting and multi-dimensional transfer function.

Intuition in Medical Image Segmentation: Visualizing Graph Edge Weights
2011 15th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2011
Weighting functions for graph-based medical image segmentation algorithms (e.g., Graph cut) have a significant effect on the segmentation, but to our knowledge no tool provides the user with intuition towards their proper selection. The large variety, their complexity, and the limited feedback hinders comparison of choices. This paper describes a package developed to visualize the effects of various edge weighting functions and parameters, in which the image of interest is overlaid with colors depicting the relative distances from the nearest seed to each voxel. By seeing the colors vary while changing parameters, the user gains intuition into the various options for the edge weighting function. A user study demonstrating the benefits of the package is presented. It is our hope that the intuition provided by the software will result in less time required to segment medical images in the clinical work-flow.

Real-Time Rendering of Temporal Volumetric Data on a GPU

2011
Real-time rendering of static volumetric data is generally known to be a memory and computationally intensive process. With the advance of graphic hardware, especially GPU, it is now possible to do this using desktop computers. However, with the evolution of real-time CT and MRI technologies, volumetric rendering is an even bigger challenge. The first one is how to reduce the data transmission between the main memory and the graphic memory. The second one is how to efficiently take advantage of the time redundancy which exists in time-varying volumetric data. We proposed an optimized compression scheme that explores the time redundancy as well as space redundancy of time-varying volumetric data. The compressed data is then transmitted to graphic memory and directly rendered by the GPU, reducing significantly the data transfer between main memory and graphic memory.

Edge Equalized Treemaps

2012
Treemap is a visualization method for hierarchical structures in which nodes are drawn as rectangles and arranged in a nested style. Several variations of Treemap have been developed to represent different types of data. In this paper, we propose an Edge Equalized Treemap, a representation that embeds visual data such as a bar chart in leaf rectangles. This representation is characterized by leaf rectangles of equal widths. Because their widths are equal, the scale intervals of charts in a leaf rectangle can be unified, meaning that we can compare charts simply by looking at them. We compare the Edge Equalized Treemap with existing layout methods, and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.

Three-level Visualization of Internet Discussion with Extruded Word Clouds

2012
Visualization of discussions is an intensively explored information visualization area. Many existing approaches explore the discussions from the point of view of individual participants, often omitting interesting information about the discussion itself. We present a visualization technique that centers around the discussion, its dynamics, intensity and topic changes. The flow of the text is divided into uniform time spans that aggregate the data and where the text analyzer runs. Then, the discussion is visualized using three different levels of details. The topmost shows the global view of the discussion development over time, the middle shows an inside view on discussions' main topics, and the bottom level displays individual word clouds. The technique is demonstrated on data from an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) but it can be used for visual analysis of any time-dependent text data such as email communication, search terms, keywords and similar.

Fast Layout Computation of Hierarchically Clustered Networks: Algorithmic Advances and Experimental Analysis
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
Fast computation of two-dimensional layouts of hierarchically clustered networks is a well-studied problem in graph visualization. We present algorithmic and experimental advances on the subject: (i) We propose a new drawing algorithm that combines space-filling and fast force-directed methods; it runs in O(nlogn+m) time, where n and m are the number of vertices and edges of the network, respectively. This running time does not depend on the number of clusters, thus the algorithm guarantees good time performances independently of the structure of the cluster hierarchy. As a further advantage, the algorithm can be easily parallelized. (ii) We present an experimental analysis aimed at understanding which clustering algorithms can be used, in combination with our visualization technique, to generate better quality drawings for medium and large networks with small-world and scale-free structure. As far as we know, no previous similar experiments have been done in this respect.

The constant growth of available genealogical information has encouraged the research of visualization techniques capable of representing the corresponding large amount of data. An H-Tree Layout has been recently proposed to represent pedigree data as a way to overcome some of the limitations of traditional representations. However, this new method has its own limitations which may hinder its adoption. In this paper, we propose some enhancements to the H-Tree Layout pedigree visualization method in order to overcome some of the identified limitations. An implementation of the proposed enhancements and results of a preliminary evaluation are also provided.

Animation for Time-oriented Data: An Overview of Empirical Research

2012
The usage of visualizations to aid the analysis of time oriented data plays an important role in various fields of applications. The need to visualize such data was decisive for the development of different visualization techniques over the last years. One of the frequently applied techniques is animation in order to illustrate the movements in such a way to make changes in the data transparent. However, evaluation studies of such animated interfaces for time-oriented data with potential users are still difficult to find. In this paper, we present our observations based on a systematic literature review with the motivation to support researchers and designers to identify future directions for their research. The literature review is split in two parts: (1) research on animation from the field of psychology, and (2) evaluation studies with the focus on animation of time-oriented data.

Lowering Visual Clutter in Large Component Diagrams
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
Nowadays component applications can easily consist of hundreds or thousands of components and it is thus difficult to understand their structure. Diagram visualisation does not help much because of visual clutter caused by big amount of elements and connections, especially in the case of flat component models. This paper describes a novel approach of removing a large part of connections from the diagram while preserving the information about component interconnections. It uses a separated components area to show the components with big amount of connections. For each component in this area, clustered interfaces are shown instead of all interfaces, with the ability to show details on demand. The main idea of this technique can be used in a similar way to reduce the clutter in node-link graphs. To show the effect of this technique we discuss example lines reductions for several component applications.

In this paper, we report two methods to visualize migration of people in an artificial society. The artificial society system we target have been developed for simulating demographic changes in prehistoric and protohistoric periods in Japan. The system is capable of long term simulation of demographic changes in and migration between areas. We visualize migration from two perspectives: global view and family view. Global view focuses on the flow of people in migration. Family view focuses family relations in migration and visualizes it with a graph.

Visualizing Patterns in Node-link Diagrams
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
Pattern discovery plays an important part in the graph analysis process. Good examples are the detection of communities in social networks or the clustering into pathways of metabolic networks. However, elements may be shared by several clusters, making the patterns entangled. When mining such data, experts are usually interested in both each individual cluster and their overlaps. Dedicated visualization methods are therefore necessary to efficiently support their exploration process. In this article, we propose a new method that emphasizes patterns in a node-link diagram representation and allows to easily identify overlaps between these patterns as well. Our technique combines graph topology and embedding to compute concave hulls with holes surrounding the patterns of interest.

AIVA vs UML: Comparison of Component Application Visualizations in a Case-study
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
UML is the state of the art in visualization of software. However, it does not satisfy the needs of modeling in the domain of component applications and complex software architectures. UML has to be extended with profiles so as to be able to model the specifics of a particular component model; its diagrams are not scalable, therefore one has to balance the amount of information and readability; and it presents all the information at once so visual data mining is harder. These were the reasons for developing a completely new approach called AIVA (Advanced Interactive Visualization Approach) that focuses solely on the component domain and addresses the problems of scalability and readability by adopting interactive techniques like information hiding and details on demand. In this paper we analyse how this new approach stands compared with UML by modelling a nontrivial component application.

2012
Many efforts from both artists and scientists on color design have resulted in a variety of models and rules devoted to coloring graphics. Based on these results, a lot of interactive tools are now available to help with color design based on various sorts of color themes, templates, palettes, swatches, brushes, etc. However, despite the numbers of tools and results available, in many situations, color design is still tedious and time consuming for both amateurs and professionals. In this paper, we introduce visual color design as a new approach to handling coloring problems interactively. The coloring of web documents is used to illustrate our approach with a real case study. The case study takes as input (1) a given color image and (2) an HTML/CSS document to be colored.

Integrated Visualization of Gene Network and Ontology Applying a Hierarchical Graph Visualization Technique
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
A gene network is constructed with genes as nodes, and interactions between genes as edges so as to reveal unknown gene functions and relationship. However, nodes and edges of gene networks are usually very numerous. Because of that, it may be difficult to understand relations between genomic functions and gene-gene interactions, if it is visualized by traditional techniques. This paper presents our technique on visualization of gene networks and gene ontology(GO), which summarizes gene functions and attributes. The technique represents the functions defined by GO as colors of nodes, and bundles edges depending on the gene functions to ease visual complication of the network.

Visualizing the Evolution of Software Systems Using the Forest Metaphor
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
We present an approach based on a forest metaphor to ease the comprehension of evolving object oriented software systems. The approach takes advantages of familiar concepts such as forests of trees, sub-forest of trees, trunks, branches, leaves, and color of the leaves. In particular, each release of a software is represented as a forest that users (or software maintainers) can navigate and interact with. Users can pass from a release to another one, so understanding how the entire software and its classes evolve throughout the past releases. The approach has been implemented in a prototype of a 3D interactive environment. A preliminary empirical evaluation has been also conducted to assess that environment and the underlying approach.

Clutter Reduction in Multi-dimensional Visualization of Incomplete Data Using Sugiyama Algorithm
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
Visualization of uncertainty in datasets is a new field of research, which aims to represent incomplete data for analysis in real scenarios. In many cases, datasets, especially multi-dimensional datasets, often contain either errors or uncertain values. To address this challenge, we may treat these uncertainties as scalar values like probability. For visual representation in parallel coordinates, we draw a small "circle" to temporarily define a dummy vertex for an uncertain value of a data item, at the crossing point between polylines and the axis of certain dimension. Furthermore, these temporary positions of uncertainty could be permuted to achieve visual effectiveness. This feature provides a great opportunity by optimizing the order of uncertain values to tackle another important challenge in information visualization: clutter reduction. Visual clutter always obscures the visualizing structure even in small datasets. In this paper, we apply Sugiyama's layered directed graph drawing algorithm into parallel coordinates visualization to minimize the number of edge crossing among polylines, which has significantly improved the readability of visual structure. Experiments in case studies have shown the effectiveness of our new methods for clutter reduction in parallel coordinates visualization. These experiments also imply that besides visual clutter, the number of uncertain values and the type of multi-dimensional data are important attributes that affect visualization performance in this field.

Information Visualization online tools have gradually found its way into various contexts of use and Higher Education Institutions are not an exception. The considerable amount of data and information continuously produced in Higher Education Institutions provide Information Visualization professionals an interesting set of challenges which, if looked through a broader perspective all share a common goal: to assist and contribute to decision making. However, tools presently available, or in an ongoing stage, take different approaches regarding interface, interaction and goal design in Higher Education Institutions, Information Visualization tools. This paper presents a review and analysis of some Higher Education Institution Information Visualization online tools, according to an up-to-date theoretical framework. Its conclusions include some final thoughts on what is driving, or not, work and outcomes in this particular context of use.

A Polyline-based Visualization Technique for Tagged Time-varying Data
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
We have various interesting time-varying data in our daily life, such as weather data (e.g., temperature and air pressure) and stock prices. Such time-varying data is often associated with other information: for example, temperatures can be associated with weather, and stock prices can be associated with social or economic incidents. Meanwhile, we often draw large-scale time-varying data by multiple polylines in one space to compare the time variation of multiple values. We think it should be interesting if such time-varying data is effectively visualized with their associated information. This paper presents a technique for polyline-based visualization and level-of-detail control of tagged time-varying data. Supposing the associated information is attached as tags of the time-varying values, the technique generates clusters of the time-varying values grouped by the tags, and selects representative values for each cluster, as a preprocessing. The technique then draws the representative values as polylines. It also provides a user interface so that users can interactively select interesting representatives, and explore the values which belong to the clusters of the representatives.

ChronoView: Visualization Technique for Many Temporal Data
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
This paper presents a method of visualizing data that contains temporal information, such as a human's behavior and the time at which it occurs. A feature of the data is that each event may have one or more time-stamps. By analyzing this kind of data, we are able to find some behavioral patterns and obtain knowledge applicable to many fields, such as marketing research and security. We develop ChronoView, a visualization technique to support the analysis of data with temporal information. ChronoView represents an event with a set of time-stamps as a position inside a circle, similar to the dial of an analog clock. By representing each event as a position on a two-dimensional plane, we can simultaneously visualize many events and easily compare their occurrence patterns. We implement a tool based on ChronoView, which is enriched with additional functions and overcomes the drawbacks of the original system. A use case involving tweet data from Twitter illustrates the use and practicality of ChronoView.

Force-directed Graph Visualization with Pre-positioning - Improving Convergence Time and Quality of Layout
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
Modern visual analytics tools provide mechanism for users to gain unknown knowledge through effective visual interactions for user to quickly understand the progress of algorithms and adjust the input parameters on intermediate visualizations that towards the production of most satisfied outcome. This requires the quick production of a sequence of graph visualizations. However, the traditional force-directed graph drawing algorithms are very slow to reach an equilibrium configuration of forces. They usually spend tens of seconds producing the layout of a graph converge. Thus, they do not satisfy the requirement of rapid drawing of graphs. This paper proposes a fast convergence method for drawing force-directed graphs. We essentially pre-calculate the geometrical position of all vertices before applying a force-directed layout algorithm to reach the energy minimization of the graph layout. The experimental results have shown that this approach could not only reduce the convergence time but also the number of edge crossings that approves the quality of layout significantly.

Modular approaches (objects, components and service-based) offer efficient solutions to face the complexity of Information Systems. However, today they involve major problems in dealing with data/information and decisionmaking (from the standpoint of the end-user). In this article, we aim to initiate a dialogue between digital/interaction design and model-driven engineering through the study of a new data representation-visualisation approach based on generative visualisation. Due to recent advances in graphical user interfaces and interaction techniques, we expect to prove that the world of modeling could benefit from creating views of existing models defined in a modeling language complying with Meta-Object Facility (like UML).

This paper presents a review of heuristic evaluation and recommendations for how to apply the method for information visualization evaluation. Heuristic evaluation is a widely known and popular method within the area of human-computer interaction and the information visualization community now also recognizes its usefulness. However, in this area it is not applied to the same extent. In its original form the method has limitations that need to be considered in order for it to be optimal for information visualization. The aim with this paper is to provide the reader with knowledge about the method and awareness of what issues that call for refined or supplemental actions and resources in order for it to generate as valid and useful results as possible. The paper also discusses the research challenges for future work in how to further improve the method.

2012
This paper studies the idea of using animated mood pictures in the context of music recommendation. In the implemented prototype, the user interacts with a collection of pictures to receive new music recommendations from associated genres. The prototype was evaluated by 40 Finnish participants. After the first use of the prototype, the concept of selecting music based on mood pictures was found to be very good by 85% of the participants. In the longer-term use, the prototype lacked some important features such as the ability to personalize the picture and music associations. Despite this, 60% of the participants were interested in using the prototype to complement their other music player applications. This indicates that mood pictures are a promising way to access music collections and to explore new music.

As we move from analogue to digital new systems are being developed for searching and finding physical documents in archival stores. However, many digital database systems do not provide the efficiencies promised. Indeed, many make the original task harder. This short paper discusses the migration of an existing, analogue, paper-based catalogue to a digital database. It highlights the shortcomings of the new text-only digital database and outlines a series of incremental changes to this database using visual cues with user studies between each leading to a more efficient system. The findings of this study are transferable to other contexts.

This paper presents a user study that investigates 2D and 3D visualizations of bar charts in geographic maps. The task to be solved by the participants in this study required estimation of the ratio of two different spatial distance measures and relative ranking among potential candidates. The results of this experiment show that subjects were equally fast and accurate when using both the 2D and 3D visualizations. Visual discomfort was reported by almost half of the test population, but performance was not affected. Our study also showed that frequent game players did not benefit more from a 3D visualization than inexperienced game-players.

3D visualization of geophysical resistivity data to delineate contamination anomalies in a landfill

None
2012
Geophysical data represent subsoil structure in a specific area and can be used to extract subsoil information for various purposes. In this work we used this data type to detect anomalies/contamination in the subsoil. Our case study was based on data acquired around a landfill and the main objective is identifying contaminated areas as a result of leakage in landfill. This involves the application of statistical methods to detect anomalous values taking into account the whole data set, subdividing it in sublevels in relation to the surface, instead of using a single threshold (as usual). This work combines in the same software package the anomaly statistical analysis and several 3D representations of the results to validate and also helps understanding the final results of the analysis. Given that the original data used in the analysis, resistivity sections, is normally very sparse, a kriging geostatistical process was used to interpolate data in order to provide a volumetric representation of the subsoil in the area, providing a continuous spatial visualization.

An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. People now actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. This is due to the availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and blogs. The accommodation sector is one of those where the guest opinion dictates its future. This sector needs to adapt and update the services they offer to their guests in order to stay competitive. In this paper we outline the potential use of tree-oriented visual techniques to map 1500 online reviews collected from 50 small and medium hotels (SMH). Our goal is to deliver visually the results of these reviews as straightforward and intuitively as possible to the accommodation managers, enabling them use it to support their decision making.

Systrip: A Visual Environment for the Investigation of Time-series Data in the Context of Metabolic Networks
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2012
Technological advances in biology lead to a profusion of quantitative data, raising analytical challenges. Visual analytics is particularly well suited to address these difficulties. It helps to interactively move through the different levels of analysis and to simultaneously investigate data with different point of views. It is especially the case when dealing with biological networks that can contain hundreds of elements. In these studies biologists generally follow the same analytic process which consists in first getting an overview of the data before focussing on a few relevant subnetworks. In this article we present, Systrip, a visual environment for the analysis of time-series data in the context of biological networks. In particular we focus on the study of metabolism. Systrip gathers bioinformatics and graph theoretical algorithms that can be assembled in different ways to help biologists in their visual mining process. This framework had been used to analyse various real biological data. In this article we describe how it helped in understanding drug effects on the metabolism of the parasite of the tsetse fly causing sleeping sickness.

The classical representation of a binary tree generated by a hierarchical clustering is a node-link-based visualization denoted as a dendrogram. It allows users to explore in a simple way the clusters and the relationships between instances. However, exploration of large dendrograms is known to be difficult due to the graphical and cognitive information overload involved. Here, we discuss the current approaches and we introduce Stacked Trees, a new Focus+Context visualization technique that allows the exploration of the hierarchical clustering of up to fifty thousands nodes on a standard-sized screen.

Voronoi Diagram Based Dimensional Anchor Assessment for Radial Visualizations
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
Selecting the most expressed dimensions from high dimensional data sets has motivated the design and application of a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques. Here, in our current work, we introduce a metric for assessing the effectiveness of these methods. Our formulation is based on the broad concepts of: (a) devising a formal method of partitioning a visualization's image space; (b) identifying regions that indicate the relative strength of the dimension selection based on how well they are populated by data images; and (c) similarily identifying those regions indicating a poor selection of dimensions. In particular, we explore assessing the quality of radial visualizations. Dimension selection in this class of visualizations strongly effects visualization quality and the sensitivity of cluster formation. We demonstrate the usefulness of Voronoi partitioning the RadViz image space; quantifying radial visualization quality is a direct measure of dimension selection. This work continues to develop and refine the formal theory behind the general class of Normalized Radial Visualizations, including RadViz.

Visual clustering provides effective tools for understanding relationships among clusters in a data space. This paper applies an adaptation of the standard Self-Organizing Map for visual temporal clustering in exploring the customer base and tracking customer behavior of a department store over a 22-week period. In contrast to traditional clustering techniques, which often provide a static snapshot of the customer base and overlook the possible dynamics, the Self-Organizing Time Map enables exploring complex patterns over time by visualizing the results in a user-friendly way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the application using department store data with more than half a million rows of weekly aggregated customer information.

The method visually summarizes the data and helps in understanding its inner structure.

We deal in this paper with the problem of automating the process of choosing an appropriate visualization and its parameters in the context of visual data mining (VDM). To solve this problem, we develop a user assistant that performs 2 steps: the system starts by suggesting to users different mappings between their data and possible visualizations. This is performed with a simple but generic heuristic that can be applied to any visualization. Then, the user selects a visualization among those proposed by our assistant, and he may further improve the parameters set that defines the mapping between the visual attributes and the data attributes. For this purpose, we use an interactive genetic algorithm (IGA), which allows users to visually evaluate and adjust the mappings. We present a user evaluation that confirms the interest of our system in two tasks.

Using Clustering to Personalize Visualization
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
The goal of our work is to propose models or methods to personalize the visualization of a large amount of weather information in a simple way and to make sure that a user can analyze all needed information. We personalize this visualization for each user according to an automatically detected profile based on clustering. Clustering is used to group users who are similar to current user and then set the visualization variables according to the visualizations of those users.

A New Automated Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm Based on Emergent Self Organizing Maps
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
Emergent Self Organizing Map (ESOM) has been shown as a powerful nonlinear data transformation and visualization method. In [13] based on ESOM and some of its derivatives, U-Matrix and P-Matrix, a powerful automated clustering algorithm, U*C, is introduced, and it is shown that the algorithm performs better than the some of the benchmark algorithms. However, the mentioned algorithm is suitable for partitional clustering tasks, while in most of the real cases, because of the nature of the data sets (not the ESOM training algorithm) a hierarchical structure in the data can be assumed. In this paper, based on the main ideas of U*C algorithm and underlying meaning of the U-Matrix, we introduced an automated hierarchical clustering algorithm, which performs well for real data sets. After testing with some test cases, we applied the proposed algorithm on a real data set, including different energy, ICT and Urban related indicators of European and central Asian countries. The proposed algorithm identified the hierarchical groups among the selected countries.

2012
Multidimensional time-series data is common in many fields of study, and to visualize it in a compact space while retaining dimensional context as much as possible is one of the conventional and still challenging issues for information visualization. In this paper, we propose a small technique for visualizing the detailed pattern of multidimensional time-series data without losing the sight of the whole trend. In our system, two well-known techniques of Streamgraph and Heat Map visual representations are integrated along the lines of the ``focus plus context'' philosophy. We demonstrate that interactive and spatial switchover between both representations enables us to traverse the data from microscopic to macroscopic view smoothly.

InfoMaps is an information visualization tool designed for personal information management and for supporting data analysis. In this paper we briefly discuss the design of InfoMaps and explain its role in finding relevant information. InfoMaps is tightly coupled with Weave, an open source framework, providing a set of data analysis and visualization tools. Weave's framework is built with session states as its core and this provides InfoMaps the ability to store the entire user's interactions as well as visualization layouts. We discuss the implications of using the Weave framework with InfoMaps and its relevance to the field of information retrieval and visual analytics.

Visualization for Changes in Relationships between Historical Figures in Chronicles
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
A huge number of historical documents that have been accumulated for a long time are currently being digitized. However, it is difficult for us to analyze and obtain insight into the past from such documents. This paper proposes an interactive visualization system to extract networks of historical figures from historical data and to show time-varying changes in their relationships. It enables users to explore changes in the structure of the network interactively. Moreover, it extracts characteristics of each relationship, such as hostile or friendly relations, and visualizes them on the network. It enables us to understand changes in past society better by exploring changes in relationships between people.

We describe our system for visualizing data from clinical trials. The system is intended for clinicians with little or no knowledge of statistics, data mining, etc. The system is built using pluggable components, and it is easy to add more types of visualization. Currently the system supports interactive data exploration using for instance parallel coordinates, image maps, charts, and life tables. Grouping and filtering patients or subsets of data is easy and any changes are immediately reflected in all visualization tools currently used.

An Improved Algorithm for Subspace Clustering Applied to Image Segmentation
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
This paper presents a new algorithm for subspace clustering for high dimensional data. It is an iterative algorithm based on the minimization of an objective function. A major weakness of subspace clustering algorithms is that almost all of them are developed based on within- class information only or by employing both within-cluster and between- clusters information. The density of cluster is lost. The new function is developed by integrating the separation and compactness of clusters. The density of cluster is introduced also in the compactness term. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm gives good results on different types of images by optimizing the runtime.

None
2012
In this paper, a visual analysis method for finding a variety of human networks in chronicles on the basis of different viewpoints is proposed. A vast amount of human experience records is stored all over the world. For understanding and using such chronicles effectively, it is necessary to find several relations embedded in records. In this paper, we propose a chronicle analysis tool (CAT), which provides several views of records from different viewpoints. For such purpose, we introduce the notion of chronicle data and a visual analysis framework for embedded relations in chronicles. On the basis of these notions, we describe a chronicle analysis tool and show a variety of historical human networks from different viewpoints as examples of its implementation.

2012
Word-of-mouth in the Internet is rapidly increasing, but the dissemination of this information is sometime difficult to interpret. This paper presents a visualisation platform (BrandMap). It was used to structure data of brand association distribution in the blogosphere as a case study that analyses the word-of-mouth of two smartphone brands in Brazil. BrandMap is a prototype that was developed based on extensive research about word-of-mouth in the blogosphere and how to visualize brands monitoring. BrandMap uses a novel approach for information visualization of complex data. The result was the evaluation of BrandMap analyses that compared the user's perception about the advantages and disadvantages of two brands in social networks.

We present our COMmunity Boundary (COMB) and COMmunity Circles (COMC) network layout algorithms that focus on revealing the structure of discovered communities and the relationships between these communities. We believe this information is vital when developing new community mining algorithms as it allows the viewer to more quickly assess the quality of a mining result without appealing to large tables of statistics. To implement our algorithms we have introduced numerous modifications to the existing Fruchterman-Reingold layout, including support for multi-sized vertices, removal of the bounding frame, introduction of circular bounding boxes, and a novel slotting system. Our evaluation argues that both COMB and COMC outperform existing alternatives in their ability to reveal community structure and emphasize inter-community relations.

Adding a Semantic Layer to Flickr Images Search Service
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
The growing amount of images on the Web, the diffusion of social media sharing web sites demand effective tools for searching targeted images. In general, the performance of Web image search depends on the quality of images annotation, but often the keywords (or tags) associated to an image are given without relevance information, strictly connected to a subjective feeling of the taggers and far from the objective description of the image. In this paper, we propose a simple approach for social media sharing web sites such as Flickr, Zooomr, etc. to support users to retrieve images semantically correlated to a given tagged image. In this paper, we present an application scenario for Flickr: in general Flickr returns all the images that meets the input tags, without no semantic analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of the search results. Our approach adds a semantic layer on the Flickr output: processes the tags associated to the retuned images to discover the appropriate semantics of them, by arranging the results in a more user friendly view.

In this paper we propose a new graphic method for idea generation and creative problem solving called Paths to Success (P2S). P2S is a sketch-based creativity technique that is based on 15 existing creativity principles and the generative potential of images in general and sketching in particular. The goal of the method is to enable group-based and personal idea generation productivity through systematic, proven and varied creativity stimuli. The method, its background and rationale are described in the paper, as are first pilot-testing and evaluation results regarding its benefits and improvement needs. We conclude the paper by outlining future research opportunities to further test and develop the method.

Does the Medium Matter? An Experiment on the Impact of Collaboration on Visual Sales Sessions

2012
In this paper we report on the results of an experiment simulating financial sales meetings between prospective customers and a banking advisor. The study involves 112 subjects and examines effects of interactive visual sales communication on the quality of a sales encounter. We have simulated informative sales meetings where a financial sales expert explains the functioning of a mutual fund to a potential client. We have used a 2 by 2 experiment design varying the degree of interaction (with our without customer involvement) and the medium (paper versus computer) used in the meeting. The results show that the use of customer involvement elements, that is to say joint drawing, has a significant positive effect on perceived client orientation and loyalty towards the salesperson, but not on the salesperson's (perceived) expertise and trust. It also has a positive effect on perceived empathy of the sales advisor. We also found that the use of paper sketching leads to significant increased loyalty towards the salesperson when it comes to questions as "would you recommend this consultant?" Computer presentations in lieu of paper sketching do not lead to significant differences in terms of the salesperson's impact on a prospect -- except if the subject has a preference for affective information processing; in this case sketching outperforms visualization software. This article has relevance for visualization scholars and practitioners, as it provides evidence that the visualization medium and its involvement level affect communication effectiveness depending on the cognitive style of the participants.

Data Visualization in Online Journalism and Its Implications for the Production Process
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2012
Data stories -- this buzzword links together two different disciplines: computer science and journalism. The new relationship is called data-driven journalism. The emerging product of this relationship: data-based visualization that reveals the story behind the data. However, who produces those "data stories"? A journalist, an information designer, a computer scientist, or a team? New formats often implicate new workflows and a new way of thinking. This paper sets data visualization in the context of online journalism by focusing on the production process. We interviewed 19 experts of German, Swiss, and American media companies: designers, programmers, and journalists. For the analysis of the interviews we used the grounded theory approach. The findings show: The crucial success factor in the production process of data-based visualization in journalism is the attitude that everyone in the team acts as a journalist -- no matter whether programmer, designer or statistician. A case study of the New York Times newsroom illustrates our findings.

A Television News Graphical Layout Analysis Method Using Eye Tracking

None
2012
This paper presents an analysis method used to evaluate the graphical layout of Television (TV) News. With the data gathered from an eye tracker, it is possible to discern viewers' main focus of attention. However, in the case of video media, the visualisation tools of eye tracking software are insufficient for this discernment. This method uses eye tracking log files and combines them with algorithms developed using a spreadsheet application and visual data representation techniques. As a result of this combination, it is possible to identify the graphics which have greater visual attention, and subsequently, these representations supported the analysis of viewers' main focus of attention (areas of interest). A case study was also applied for the validation of this method.

In the last few years ontologies have emerged in many fields as efficient knowledge representation. Some of the visualization tools that should ease ontology understanding and exploration, are sometimes too complex to be used by domain experts, or are too simple and do not support all necessary user tasks. We present a multiple view visualization tool, which enables users a good hierarchical and relations overview as well as observation from different viewpoints. The tool embeds hierarchical connected circle, indented tree and node-link diagram. Basic and advanced functionalities allow searching, location of interest, exploration and understanding, while well thought design enables intuitive usage.

Reducing Contract Complexity through Visualization - A Multi-level Challenge

None
2012
In today's networked economy, contracts are everywhere. Most contracts are complex, as is the business they describe. Contracts are not easy to read, and their misinterpretation can cause expensive disputes between the parties. Recent research suggests an alternative to contracts written in legalese, by harnessing the benefits brought by plain language and plain design. Clarity and user-friendliness present a challenge on multiple levels: the contract as artefact, the cognitive capabilities of the readers, and the different contexts in which the contract may be used. This paper focuses on the artefact level. Using recent examples of contract visualization, we investigate ways in which text and images can work together to address the needs of different readers and help them use contracts to secure successful business outcomes.

Contracts are complex just like the business relationships, processes and tasks they seek to describe. Despite being necessary tools for collaboration, most contract users are frustrated by traditional contracts, which are long, overly legal and difficult to understand. Some approaches to managing complexity and designing user-friendly contracts have been suggested, based, for instance, on the principles of proactive law, lean manufacturing/management and plain language. Recent research has explored the possibility of using information design and visualization to facilitate knowledge transfer and collaboration in complex organizational settings. This paper investigates visualization applied to contracts. A contract prototype was created and tested with users, in order to assess whether visualized contracts are more usable and provide a better user experience than traditional text-only contracts. The paper illustrates hypotheses regarding the correlation of visualization, usability and user experience, proposes a test procedure and presents the results obtained.

Visualization in Trialogic Public Procurement Contracting

Public Procurement is a heavily regulated process, particularly its competitive tendering phase. Besides, public procurers like states and municipalities are large and complex organization environments guided by administrative regulation. Thus, in public procurement contracting, even more challenges in knowledge sharing are faced than in "normal" contracting which is a demanding cross-professional collaboration in itself. We have simulated municipal public procurement processes which have revealed a need to balance the prevailing legal attitude with design attitude. Using design tools, such as visualization of organizational processes and contracting documents, can facilitate efforts towards better collaboration and procurement success by revealing challenges in knowledge sharing and developing the legally oriented documents into knowledge sharing tools.

The network effects of the digital age have made it easier for individuals to collaborate with others to produce meaningful content from the bottom up. Architectural and urban design could benefit from these new forms of distributed collaboration, since they have the potential to introduce a wealth of knowledge and creativity in the design process. In this paper, we present a prototype online platform called 'ArchiBrain' that is built around a 'project-tree' visualization of individual design contributions, which provides participants with a structured overview of the design process they are collaborating in. Our evaluation study provides the first indications that this visualization platform is able to increase the intrinsic motivation for designers to contribute in a collaborative manner, provides a clear overview over the design process, and can help directing collaborative efforts by highlighting the most popular design proposals.

Design of urban space at pedestrian scale: A method for parameterization of urban qualities
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2012
This paper focuses on a method for parameterization of urban space at the pedestrian scale. There is a growing demand for new design approaches that would help to slow down urban sprawls, move away from modernist urban planning models and improve the quality of urban centers overall [15]. One important aspect that contributes to the overall sustainability of contemporary cities is the quality of pedestrian space. To enhance urban environment at pedestrian scale new design strategies must be investigated. Contemporary urban centers must provide various options for public transport, contain fine-grained urban functions, mixed-use building types and good-quality public open spaces to facilitate their use by pedestrians. The aim of this paper is (a) to identify the initial set of design parameters of urban form at the pedestrian scale and (b) to demonstrate the exemplary implementation of these parameters within parametric software, e.g. Grasshopper for Rhinoceros [26] and Esri CityEngine [25] for analysis, optimization and evaluation of urban settings.

This paper describes a method for creating spatial illusion projections in a simple yet efficient way. It uses the horizontal and vertical lens shift properties of a virtual camera in a 3D modelling software to produce a normalized image that can be subsequently mapped with a traditional mapping technique, as cornerpin keystone correction for instance, onto a real facade. Our calculations describe how to automatically derive horizontal and vertical shift values. The method was developed during the creation process of a series of projections created with the 3D modelling software &#x201C;Blender&#x201D;.

Criteria for Cooperative Urban Design through Digital System of Design Tools
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2012
Urban design is a public collaborative activity, which deals with our building environment. We all want to make urban areas pleasant and functional. Both lay public and professionals have to be included in the design process. They have different knowledge backgrounds and expertise, but they need to communicate and collaborate with each other, using a wide variety of digital tools available. However, it can be argued, that existing interfaces cannot meet the needs of this communication process: one of the main problems is that they are not integrated into a recognizable system of tools for public participation in urban design. At different stages of public participation in urban design special needs for specific digital tools can be identified (e.g. digital tools for decision making process, digital tool for informing lay public etc.). These stages and their related suitable digital tools will be defined in the following article as starting points for the development of the digital system of tools mentioned above. 3D city models represent a special digital tool for communication and collaboration between lay public and professionals through the whole process of participation. They are really important for visualization and simulation in cooperative design. The criteria for cooperative design using the 3D city models will be defined in this article: as essential elements of the digital system of urban design collaboration and communication tools.

Visualization is a medium for communicating information to and between people with different background knowledge. The availability of digital tools and the progress of visualization technologies enhance the potential of visual representation. But along with it, issues emerge as how to choose appropriate forms of visualization to make results generally understandable. This paper presents our approach to convey information on research conducted at ETH Zurich's Future Cities Laboratory (FCL) to a broad target audience through visualization. We first carry out a requirements analysis for the visualization task. The results of the analysis are elaborated and implemented by means of a software prototype that employs an interactive Dymaxion Map to visualize the information given in our case.

2012
The development of a physical building control center has got the purpose of supporting the management and control of a project to optimize the flow of the complex processes at a construction site. The concept consists of equipping vehicles with sensors, using virtual reality and augmented reality-techniques to visualize these realtime information and allow an optical adaption to current circumstances. A more efficient utilization and enhanced cost effectiveness will be the result. Based on a previous performed requirement analysis a software architecture (AR4CC, "Augmented Reality for Construction Control") has been developed, which allows the use of virtual reality (vr) and augmented reality (ar) at a construction site.

Augmented Reality Technology and Art: The Analysis and Visualization of Evolving Conceptual Models
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
This paper provides a logical and methodological reconstruction of the evolving concept of Augmented Reality (AR) and also of the paradigmatic shift in art, caused by this emerging technology. It starts with an analysis of the notion of Augmented Reality, that leads to the construction of a conceptual model and a definition which together capture the nature of present AR applications. This is followed by a detailed conceptual analysis of major types of Augmented Reality that contribute to an understanding of current concepts. Finally, the resulting conceptual models are applied to the newly emerging field of Augmented Reality Art in order to assess the paradigmatic potential of AR as a new artistic medium. The paper puts a strong emphasis on the effective and adequate visualisation of the analysed conceptual frameworks, in order to promote a better comprehension of the logical structures underlying the notions of Augmented Reality and AR Art. This paper was intended to be presented at the opening of the First International Symposium on Augmented Reality Visualisation and Art, proposed and chaired by the author as part of the 16th International Conference on Information Visualization, IV2012.

A Multilevel Force-directed Graph Drawing Algorithm Using Multilevel Global Force Approximation
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
In this paper we discuss an efficiency saving for multilevel force directed placement algorithms. Typically such algorithms use a Barnes Hut octree (or sometimes a grid) in order to approximate global repulsive forces. Here we instead exploit the graph coarsening structure, already in place to facilitate the multilevel scheme, in order to provide a hierarchical approximation to the global forces. Not only is this more efficient, but also it takes better account of the graph structure than an octree or a grid.

Boundary Labeling of Graph Edges Using Colors
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
One of the problems of applying graph drawing techniques to information visualization is the problem of displaying edge labels. These labels often contain information that is important to the user, but the displayed text can make the drawing less clear. One solution is to put the text of the label outside the drawing, usually at the left or right border. Then, the main issue is connecting these texts to the corresponding edge. In this paper, we present a solution that uses colors (color coding) to solve this problem in such a way, that only minimal intrusion into the drawing of the graph is necessary.

Debugging the Execution of Distributed Algorithms over Anonymous Networks
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2012
Computing the global state of an asynchronous distributed system is a widely studied problem and finds a plethora of solutions under different assumptions. Most of them do not correspond to real-life requirements. In this paper, we address the global snapshot and the global predicate evaluation problems in anonymous and asynchronous networks. We present a fully-distributed solution which allows the debugging and the monitoring of such networks. We show that our contribution can be easily implemented and added as a new feature in existing simulation softwares by describing specifications of the used model and details of the development process. As an illustration, a debugging layer is implemented on the ViSiDiA platform.

Playing with Reconciliation: Engaging Primary School Students with the Values of Reconciliation Using a Video Game

2012
The use of games in educational contexts is not new [see 22, 12, 10, 17, 8, 11, 6]. However, the exploration of evoking the values of reconciliation through a 3D interactive game for primary students is novel. This short paper outlines a recent video game development that explores notions of reconciliation in the context of a shared culture between non-Indigenous and Indigenous peoples of colonised lands. The game is designed to address the key concepts of reconciliation that is, trust, empathy and collaboration. Evaluation of 29 school-aged children suggests there is much efficacy in this approach. The study forms the basis for ongoing collaborative research with national education authorities to include the game in the national curriculum. The framework developed will be transferable to other contexts and countries facing similar issues.

A Video Game Level Analysis Model Proposal
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
This paper presents a preliminary model proposal for the analysis of video game level scenarios consisting of four elements: video game, players, metrics, and gaming experience. The selection of parameters from each of these elements defines a specific video game level analysis context. Initial validation of the model is being carried out with a First-person shooter video game and selected metrics (including eye movement behavior) to understand player behavior (both interactive and visual) within a game level. An additional analysis technique based on visual representation techniques applied in this validation context is also described. After validated, this model may be applied in the analysis of player behavior in game levels, in several different situations predicted in the model itself. Information acquired from the application of this model may posteriorly be used in the design (or redesign) of game levels and scenarios driven for optimal use which should generate a greater gaming experience.

Monotony Preserving Scattered Data Interpolation Scheme Using Side-vertex Method
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
This paper addresses the problem of monotone scattered data interpolation. An interpolation scheme is developed to interpolate the scattered data assembled over the triangular grid. The developed interpolation scheme utilizes a family of rational cubic function. The edges of each triangle are interpolated by the rational cubic function. The rational cubic function is also used to join vertices to their opposite edges. This practice provide three vertex boundary interpolating functions. Resultant rational triangular function is the convex combination of these vertex boundary interpolants. The developed rational interpolating scheme assures continuity at each vertex of triangle and along the boundaries of each triangle. Since the rational function has parameters in its definition, so these are inherited in rational triangular function. The constraints are developed on half of these parameters to preserve the shape of data while remaining are free for shape modification.

Millions of women are suffering from breast cancer today. Breast cancer can be treated effectively when detected early. Mammography is broadly recognized as the most effective imaging modality for an early detection of breast cancer abnormalities. Computer-aided diagnosis systems are very helpful for radiologist in detection and diagnosing abnormalities earlier and faster than traditional screening programs. In this paper, two techniques are proposed based on statistical and LBP features using support vector machine (SVM) and the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers. The evaluation of the system is applied on Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). The system classifies normal from abnormal cases with high accuracy rate.

In this paper we consider one of the approaches to solving the range searching problem for a range which is bounded by a convex surface in Euclidean d-dimensional space. In particular, we propose a method of range searching which gives query time O(logN) and uses O(NlogN) memory where N is cardinality of an input data set. It is enabled by applying optimal data structures for storing points in nodes of a quadtree.

Zone Modelling and Visualisation: Keys to the Design of Low Carbon Buildings
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
A new approach to building modelling software, to support the iterative design of energy efficient buildings, is proposed. The proposal is for the combination of two, previously separate, software types - building design modelling and building performance simulation, along with the development of a third component - a design advisor, into one software tool. This software is intended for use by architectural practices, who may not have access to energy expertise, and who may then struggle to maintain design standards for non-domestic buildings required to satisfy rigorous energy performance regulations. In this paper we describe, through an example, how the three components would work together, by the employment of zone meshes, to visualise, simulate and support with information and advice, the design of a building. The novelty of the method resides in the application of underlying zone meshes for the support of iterative building design. The approach is described, illustrated and future work outlined.

The Importance of Micro-climate Modification for Adaptation of Welsh Housing to Climate Change
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
This paper addresses opportunities for adaptation of the microclimate surrounding housing in response to climate change. It is based on study of an existing town and two local social housing organisations in South Wales, UK. It argues the design of external spaces around dwellings will become more important as changes in lifestyle and levels of outdoor activity are likely to increase, in natural response to changed climatic conditions. It suggests that: in South Wales housing is still being built that, in its fabric, risks overheating within perhaps two decades ( some overheating is already experienced); hence that external contextual environment adaptation measures may become increasingly critical; and that current regulations and codes focus overmuch on the building, so the external contextual environment is not addressed with the importance it deserves. This is compounded because mastery of integrated micro-climate simulation with building and urban modelling tools is a challenge for the average architectural designer. More data, more research, better tools and file data exchange are held necessary.

Beyond Level 2 BIM, Web Portals and Collaboration Tools

The UK government defines Level 2 Building Information Modelling (BIM) as collaborative use of a BIM process, not software per se, within the full design and construction team. They perceive the resulting a&#x0302;federated single point of truth' as central in improving shared communication and consensus. The government will require all engaged in the design construction and management of publicly funded buildings and infrastructure to share that process by 2016. It is argued that it is not enough for all users to deploy focused BIM software, however adroitly. Broader construction information management visualisation and collaboration tools are needed, including web tools, applications, apps, and portals, benefiting from the extension of contemporary ICT through a&#x0302;Web 2.0' and beyond. Projects are described that used database-driven collaborative web modelling of the built and natural environment with non-proprietary and software-independent forms of a&#x0302;mark-up' for collaboration and consensus building and architectural visualisation.

This paper presents a research experience held in Beijing since 2009 by Dardus Department of Polytechnic University of Marche and Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. During a wider research campaign for knowledge and restoration of the Yanqing Section of Chinese Great Wall, the research staff faced the issues linked to the information management on a large size heritage work. The main questions were the presence of many different types of information, acquired across different times and with many methods and techniques, and the needs to visualize in the proper way that information in order to obtain analytical reference for the design strategies. The staff defined suitable methods for data acquisition and management, based in a new reading criterion of the monument features. The proposed visualization methods tried to collect the various data in a unique, interactive and immersive environment.

Digital visualisation technologies have transformed the field of heritage. The digital re-creation of a place demands much more than architectural modeling. Designers of virtual heritage places can learn from commercial computer games which can be very successful at creating a sense of place. The Virtual Sydney Rocks is designed to undertake research into the role that user preference for interaction strategy has on engagement in a Virtual Heritage Environment. Users can explore an experiential model of Sydney Cove between 1788 and 2008 in three different ways; by self directed exploration, by playing a game or by taking a tour. Users set the date and time to determine the position of the sun, the weather, the sounds that are heard and the buildings that are displayed. Users can also alter the speed of time. Additional information is accessed via the interlinked Virtual Sydney Rocks Guidebook.

Framing Interaction through Engagement in Interactive Open Ended Environments

In this paper we present preliminary pilot study of how people's interactions can be characterized in open-ended environments through the concept of engagement. By open - ended environments we refer to physical spaces that construct content and associated semantics through non-didactic methods supportive of non - linear navigation. This work presents an overview of an approach to interactions as mapping human actions and their characteristics, through which behavior features can be identified. The interpretation is based on the extension of previous work, the Kinetic Inter-Acting System, that interprets, visualises and offers means for analysis of the interaction process between parties enabling visual reasoning about the quality of interactions. The approach is examined in the context of new developments in museums that perceives them as becoming creative and reflective agents in digital humanities. Examples are taken from a large public immersive exhibition that relies upon interaction delivered through various modalities for content assimilation and participant experience.

Cultural heritage exhibitions commonly have to arrange a high amount of diverse artefacts and associated information in architecturally complex facilities. This constellation issues challenges to both: exhibition designers who have to find ways to deal with spatial restrictions and visitors who often experience cognitive overload and museum fatigue due to the high amount of information available. Against this background, the article is focusing on the question, how information visualization can serve as advance organizer, to make the organizing principles of cultural heritage exhibitions (like common topics, themes, geographical or temporal origin) transparent to the visitors. For this purpose, we extend the visualization method of time geography to an interactive visualization framework of time topography, which can support the interactive exploration of conceptual and physical cultural heritage exhibition spaces in parallel.

More Than Meets the Eye: Cross-cultural Interpretations of Digitally Manipulated Photography
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
Interpreting visual information conveyed by artistic traditions based on culturally different epistemological and conceptual frameworks offers significant challenges. There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that deeply monocultural Australian students learning about certain 'Asian' artistic traditions for the first time are particularly susceptible to making serious interpretive errors when reading 'other-culture' visual imagery, despite the fact that such visual information may look - on the surface at least - very similar to imagery in artworks with which they are culturally familiar. This is a problem that goes well beyond the purely pedagogical, affecting all persons working towards an understanding of the visual information conveyed by cultural products outside of their own experience. Furthermore, this applies to digital art as much as to painting and other media. Therefore it is important that when working in such cross-cultural contexts the understanding that there is often a good deal more to understanding visual artwork than the purely visual - or that which meets the eye - be nurtured and developed. The following analysis of photographic artworks exhibited by South Korean-born, Newcastle-based digital artist Tae Yang ('Sunny') Hong in his recent exhibition WOMEN, TECHNOLOGY, UTOPIA, presents such an interpretive challenge. Sunny Hong uses a blurring technique based on the Chinese philosophical tradition of Taoism, arising directly from the Hun Yuan Qi system. To understand and engage with Hong's oeuvre it is thus essential that one develop a visual and cultural knowledge-based understanding of the belief system underlying Hong's approach. The aim of this paper is therefore to contribute to a greater understanding of the fundamental principle that cultural difference is deeply encrypted in visual information, and that such difference goes beyond the visual, insofar as it resides at the level of the episteme. It should be added that today, as a result of increasing globalisation, there is very little visual art that does not draw upon a range of cultural influences, or evince a level of cultural hybridity, and Hong's oeuvre is no exception. Rosenberg's poetic model of research, developed specifically in relation to visual art and design research, will be brought into play here in order to illuminate Sunny Hong's body of visual artwork.

Research of Styles and Visualisation Characteristics on Chinese Engraved Ancient Book Typeface Culture
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
This research mainly conducted a study on the point size for Ming Dynasty Wangli Reign engraved books of China. This is a research focused on the subject of typeface point size. A study on editing elements among different typefaces in Chinese ancient engraved books was conducted in order to clarify if there was a specific rule on point sizes used. We also tried to understand if there was any absolute connection between point size and the size of version. This research investigated 217 Ming Dynasty Wangli Reign engraved books collected by the National Central Library of Taiwan. We have derived point size rules applied to various editing items and the popular forms in the time of specific engraved versions from these engraved books. We than analyzed and integrated overall factors that had constituted point sizes on engraved books. The result indicated that there were no limits on point size when it comes to application of typeface. However, there were certain connections existed between the width of columns and point size on these ancient books. The following characteristics were observed when we explored Ming Dynasty Wangli Reign typeface size: 1. For point sizes on the Ming Dynasty Wangli Reign version, most of them are distributed in the segment from size 38 to size 50. The number for size 44 ranks as the highest. 2. The largest size is 56 while the smallest is 20. Size 56 accounts for the biggest number of sizes. 3. For point sizes on volume names, most of them are in the segment from size 38 to size 50. With this, we came to the conclusion that point sizes for Ming Dynasty Wangli Reign version engraved ancient book poses special characteristics on Cultural Heritage Knowledge Visualisation.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States. Although several genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in AD risks, no single factor is found solely responsible for disease manifestation in all Alzheimer's cases. In cases when no single gene can explain causality, the scenario of a combination of factors with modest effect sizes has been suggested. Through means of visual analysis in Weave we uncovered and further strengthened growing evidence for the link between genetics, air pollution and an earlier onset of Alzheimer's disease as exemplified in US cities with the highest reported levels of toxicity. Major sources of bias impacting our dataset are examined to caution the reader about the value of correlation findings in this less than ideal study sample.

With emerging amounts of genomic data, research in the field of computational molecular biology is calling for new tools for displaying macromolecular structures. In this short article, we describe StructAlignViewer - a software package for visualizing protein structures and spatial super positions. StructAlignViewer can be used in a standalone mode or in conjunction with an in-house software for optimal pairwise protein structure alignment. The program can display a single protein or a superposition of two proteins. The distinguishing feature of StructAlignViewer is its ability to visualize, in real time, the pairwise structural super positions and alignments generated by the protein structure alignment algorithm MaxPairs.

2012
Understanding protein structures is a crucial step in creating molecular insight for researchers as well as students and pupils. The enormous scaling gap between an atomic point of view and objects in daily life hampers developing an intuitive relation between them. Especially for high school students, it can be difficult to understand the spatial relations of a protein structure. Due to lack of direct imaging techniques, molecules can only be explored by studying abstract molecular models. Here, the use of Augmented reality (AR) techniques has proven to strongly improve structural perception. In this work we present ProteinScanAR, an augmented reality framework for biomolecular education that allows connecting virtual and real worlds intuitively, and thus enables focusing on the scientific or educational content. Special attention was taken to guarantee implementational and technical requirements as general and simple as possible to alleviate application in nonexpert computer settings.

The recurrent outbreaks of pathogens that possess new virulence factors and broad range antibiotic resistance gene cassettes reflect the importance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. In many cases, the establishment of pathogens is mediated by the mobile genetic islands (GIs) which can easily be interchanged between bacterial taxa inhabiting the same or different environments. New computational tools to visualize and track down the network of distribution of GIs among bacteria are proposed in this work.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic and treatment evaluation tool which is very widely used in various areas of medicine. MRI images provide very high quality images of the brain tissue and so can be used to study the brain conditions. This research paper proposes a productive technique to classify brain MRI images. Examining the MRI brain images manually is not only slow but is also error prone. In order to both speed up the process and maintain the quality of the classification we need a very high-quality classification system. In this research work, advanced classification techniques based on the well known SIFT and Gabor features are applied on brain images. From our analysis we observed that a hybrid feature derived with SIFT and Gabor features yielded a higher accuracy than Gabor features alone.

The Architecture Represented Computationally (ARC) project analyzes documents that describe Gothic cathedrals. It researches how these descriptions can be translated from a natural language into a formal logical model - a representation that a computer can handle. Handling representations of architecture is not straightforward and requires expertise involving logical reasoning. ARC implements this expertise in Prolog.

VersuS, The Digital Lives of Cities Transforms into Usable Interconnective Intelligence
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2012
While we perform our daily tasks we reinterpret space and personalize it, according to tactics which reveal significant information about ourselves. We are now able to fill and stratify space/time with digital information layers, completely wrapping cities in a membrane of information and of opportunities for interaction and communication. Mobile devices, smartphones, wearables, digital tags, near field communication devices, location based services and mixed/augmented reality have turned the world into an essentially read/write, ubiquitous publishing surface. The usage of mobile devices and ubiquitous technologies alters the understanding of place. The scenario described in this paper sees urban spaces progressively filling with multiple layers of real-time, ubiquitous, digital information, creating usage cases in which urban narratives are read in different ways, highlighting how cities express points of view on the environment, culture, economy, transports, energy and politics. The research presented in this paper analyses multiple opportunities to capture, understand and visualize the real-time digital lives of cities, from a variety of points of view and objectives, dedicated to the needs of administrations, citizens and organizations, and to the possibility to transform these representations into a form of disseminated, ubiquitous, interconnective intelligence.

Traditional Settlements Boundary Visualization

To control the space is an important task in preserving cultural heritage. For example, the edge design of traditional settlements in historical cities and blocks determines the basic size, space and shape of the space. However, unlike the space designed in paper, the formation of edges of traditional settlements are the presentation of residents' public consciousness in the settlements, value orientation and behaviour law under the long-term historical influence, rather than the expression of the designer's personal moment will. This topic cites some traditional cities and settlements of Fujian sea system in China as example and use the boundary as research subject in order to present non-objective historical documents hidden in this system in details by researching documents, field study and chart analysis. The article also comes up with a new angle of research into Cultural Heritage Knowledge Visualization.

How to Best Meet Consumers' Preferences for New Product Design: An Application of Art and Design
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
In the traditional product design field, most studies focus on commercial products (e.g. furniture, vehicle, consumer electronics, and so on), while few studies pay attention on the craft art. As such, this paper conducts a consumer-oriented experiment on characteristic toys to determine how to best meet consumers' preferences for new product design. The characteristic toy is a good illustration to be an application of art and design, because it is not only one type of craft art, but also a commercial product. The characteristic toy has two features simultaneously of craft art and product design. In this study, the new approach proposed consists of two main methods, i.e. the quantification theory type I (QTTI) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). There are three QTTI models used to build a design decision support database. According to the design decision support database, a QTTI-based TOPSIS model is used to help product designers to obtain the optimal design alternatives that best meet consumers' preferences.

The goal of this paper is to present an information visualization application capable of opening and coordinating information over two or more datasets. We have chosen this approach to address some of the limitations of various applications. Also, the application uses multiple coordinated views and multiple simultaneous datasets. We highlight the application layout configuration by the user, including the flexibility to specify the number of data views and to associate different datasets for each visualization technique. Diferente approaches are suggested of how to deal and interact with multiple datasets.

Weave (Web-based Analysis and Visualization Environment) facilitates extensive real-time user interaction with visualizations of US Census Bureau data, both geographic and non-geographic. This paper discusses the complexities of preparing a large complex data set for visualization in the tool, and the potential advantages of engaging such data visually. The required pre-processing of the American Community Survey (ACS) data serves as the prime example. The procedure for loading detailed data into Weave is described. Several examples of presenting and interactively manipulating Census data are presented including analytics using R Project supported statistics and how drawing upon Weave's multigeo layering capabilities can support flexibility in implementing normalization options. The development trajectory for weave seeks to expand capabilities for metadata insertion, browsing and searching this rich data source.

Nowadays in software development process more attention is paid to the final usability of the product. To achieve such usability we use various methods from user centered design up to the usability evaluation methods, requiring much attention from usability experts. The presense of these experts are needed both during capturing and analysing usability data, which eventually costs too much. We propose a tool for automated data capturing during user tests as well as a captured data analysis in order to evaluate the recorded interaction and guide the attention of software developers. Furthermore we provide a simple statistics of user tests as well as a means to browse recorded data with the interaction context extended with eye tracking data.

A Model to Store Coordination Mappings
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
Exploratory tasks supported by visualization are usually improved by Coordinated and Multiple Views (CMV) of the data under study. Several coordination techniques have been proposed in the literature, resulting in a diversity of tools to generate mappings among the multiple views. These mappings can be highly dynamic, and their history reveals the settings employed in the multiple exploratory tasks conducted in a discovery process. Several solutions have been proposed to help users to recover the steps performed in exploratory tasks, but little support is found for registering the multiple coordination mappings employed. This paper provides a contribution in this direction, proposing a model for storing and recovering such mappings. We believe such a facility is an important feature of CMV systems, so that users can recover and rerun the coordinations performed when exploring their data. We present details of the proposed model and show some potential applications.

A Comparison of Methods for Visualizing Musical Genres
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2012
A well-designed visualization can make the exploration of music collections an intuitive and entertaining experience. In this paper, four different methods (colors, icons, fonts and avatars) for visualizing musical genres are presented and compared against each other. The performance of the different visualizations was studied in a series of online surveys with mostly Finnish participants, and the findings were then utilized in designing novel GUIs for an existing music recommendation system. Based on the results, the best performance can be achieved by combining different visualization methods together; while colors alone were not a good method for visualizing musical genres, the best performing method (avatars) was partially based on the findings of color and icon questionnaires. The easiest genre to visualize was metal; it performed best in both online questionnaires and practical prototype design.

Multi-display environment (MDE) has evolved in recent years; however, the adjustment of common visualization system to MDEs poses several challenges. This paper describes an information visualization (IV) tool for a distributed and scalable environment with coordinated multiple views of data, which simulates an extended desktop across multi-display. This work is limited to the use of three monitors. This document presents satisfactory results of preliminary tests of usability. Performance tests showed an IV pipeline is more optimized than the common visualization tool.

Satellite and Aerial Image Mosaicing - A Comparative Insight
2012 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2012
Image registration or image stitching is a central operation in many useful and important tasks in image processing like maps construction, scanning large documents and panoramic photos creation. In particular image mosaicing is used to assemble several overlapping images in order to constitute the global frame. We will focus on a feature-point matching method to perform the mosaicing. The SIFT algorithm is used to extract the feature points in both images. The mosaicing result is obtained after transforming the sensed or target image to align to the reference image. Performing a mosaicing operation is not sufficient to claim reaching the goal. Objective metrics must be used to evaluate the resulting mosaic. In this paper we present a complete mosaicing system named EsiReg and give a brief comparative insight on results of stitching satellite and aerial images using well known performance metrics.

A Visual Analytics Tool for System Logs Adopting Variable Recommendation and Feature-Based Filtering
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Analysis and monitoring of system logs such as transaction logs and access logs is important for various objectives including trend discovery, update effort determination, and malicious behavior monitoring. However, it is not always an easy task because these logs may be massive, consisting of millions of records containing tens of variables, and therefore it may be difficult or time-consuming to discover significant knowledge. This paper presents a visual analytics tool which enables us to effectively observe system logs. The tool recommends variables that can reveal interesting discoveries and provides feature-based filtering that selects meaningful items from the visualization results. This paper also presents the result of experiments for non-professional users.

Matching Application Requirements with Dynamic Graph Visualization Profiles
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Mapping a dynamic graph dataset to an inappropriate visualization leads to a degradation of visualization performance at some task. To tap the full potential of existing dynamic graph visualization techniques, we propose a methodology for matching application requirements with dynamic graph visualization profiles. We target at supporting experts choosing the right visualization technique. Our methodology describes both the application requirements and the visualization techniques as profiles covering important aesthetic criteria for visualizing dynamic graphs. Characteristics of the graph and task are used to derive the application profile. The probably most appropriate visualization technique is the one whose profile matches best the required application profile. We compile exemplary visualization profiles for representatives of dynamic graph visualization approaches and demonstrate the methodology in a case study.

Multivariate Network Exploration with JauntyNets

2013
The amount of data produced in the world every day implies a huge challenge in understanding and extracting knowledge from it. Much of this data is of relational nature, such as social networks, metabolic pathways, or links between software components. Traditionally, those networks are represented as node-link diagrams or matrix representations. They help us to understand the structure (topology) of the relational data. However in many real world data sets, additional (often multidimensional) attributes are attached to the network elements. One challenge is to show these attributes in context of the underlying network topology in order to support the user in further analyses. In this paper, we present a novel approach that extends traditional force-based graph layouts to create an attribute-driven layout. In addition, our prototype implementation supports interactive exploration by introducing clustering and multidimensional scaling into the analysis process.

Edge Bundling by Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
We introduce a technique for bundling edges in graphs where a hierarchical organization of the vertices is not available. Instead of applying time-complex force-directed edge bundling, we adopt the concept of Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs). We use RRTs for fast computation of a hierarchical space organization that is independent of the spatial structure of the graph layout. Due to this independency, edge bundling can be applied to any graph layout and even allows us to define spatial obstacles through which no bundles may lead. Furthermore, when adding or removing graph nodes and edges on-the-fly, the bundling structure remains stable, which cannot be guaranteed for force-directed bundling. The main benefit of RRT bundling is its high efficiency, supporting interactive exploration. We rely on the low runtime complexity for a new interaction technique for visual clutter reduction in node-link diagrams that we refer to as the RRT edge bundling lens.

Force-Directed Parallel Coordinates

2013
Parallel coordinates are a well-known and valuable technique for the analysis and visualization of high dimensional data sets. However, while Inselberg emphasizes that the strength of parallel coordinates as a methodology is rooted in exploration and interactivity, the set of interaction techniques is currently limited. Axes can be re-ordered and brushing (simple, angular or multi-dimensional) can be performed. In this paper, we propose a force-directed algorithm and related interaction techniques to support the exploration of parallel coordinate plots through a physical metaphor. Our parallel-coordinates visualization offers novel user interaction beyond the standard techniques by allowing the user to rotate the axis according to forcedirected polylines. The new interaction provides the user with a more immersive experience for data exploration that results in greater intuition of the data, especially in cases where many polylines overlap. We demonstrate our approach, then present the results of a qualitative evaluation of the system.

Prefix Tag Clouds

None
2013
Tag clouds are a popular way to visually represent word frequencies. However, one major limitation is that they do not relate different word forms but treat every form as an individual tag. This results not only in a non-efficient use of screen space but, in particular, leaves the viewer with no indication whether there are other forms of a word or not. To overcome this limitation, we introduce prefix tag clouds: a visualization technique that uses a prefix tree to group different word forms and visualizes the sub trees as tag cloud. The grouping is emphasized by color, while the relative frequencies of the word forms are indicated by font size. A circular tag cloud layout supports the quick identification of the most frequent words and word forms. We show the usefulness of the approach for a large dataset of paper titles from the computer science bibliography DBLP.

Radial Layered Matrix Visualization of Dynamic Graphs
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
We propose a novel radial layered matrix visualization for dynamic directed weighted graphs in which the vertices can also be hierarchically organized. Edges are represented as color-coded arcs within the radial diagram. Their positions are defined by polar coordinates instead of Cartesian coordinates as in traditional adjacency matrix representations: the angular position of an edge within an annulus is given by the angle bisector of the two related vertices, the radial position depends linearly on the angular distance between these vertices. The exploration of time-varying relational data is facilitated by aligning graph patterns radially. Furthermore, our approach incorporates several interaction techniques to explore dynamic patterns such as trends and countertrends. The usefulness is illustrated by two case studies analyzing large dynamic call graphs acquired from open source software projects.

Arrangement of Low-Dimensional Parallel Coordinate Plots for High-Dimensional Data Visualization
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Multidimensional data visualization is an important research topic that has been receiving increasing attention. Several techniques that use parallel coordinate plots have been proposed to represent all dimensions of data in a single display space. In addition, several other techniques that apply scatter plot matrices have been proposed to represent multidimensional data as a collection of low-dimensional data visualization spaces. Typically, when using the latter approach it is easier to understand relations among particular dimensions, but it is often difficult to observe relations between dimensions separated into different visualization spaces. This paper presents a framework for displaying an arrangement of low-dimensional data visualization spaces that are generated from high-dimensional datasets. Our proposed technique first divides the dimensions of the input datasets into groups of lower dimensions based on their correlations or other relationships. If the groups of lower dimensions can be visualized in independent rectangular spaces, our technique packs the set of low-dimensional data visualizations into a single display space. Because our technique places relevant low-dimensions closer together in the display space, it is easier to visually compare relevant sets of low-dimensional data visualizations. In this paper, we describe in detail how we implement our framework using parallel coordinate plots, and present several results demonstrating its effectiveness.

Text Visualization: Expressive Materials and Diverse Approaches

Researches on text visualization have been extensively carried out with the development of the computer, the rise of open data based on Open API, and the commodification of visualization tools. Also, text visualization has led to the convergence of different fields, such as science, art, liberal arts, and sociology. Text visualization has a wide range of materials from the form and structure of text to contents text has created, not to mention independent meaning of each text. These materials are deliberately selected in accordance with the object of text visualization: what to express. A diversity of options could be used to achieve this goal. This paper is aimed to examine text data as materials for text visualization, an important part of data visualization, and discuss its types, nature and traits. This paper also explores different text visualization cases to provide a diversified analysis of expressive approaches to text visualization.

The fact is that in many Visual Analysis tasks are often used various mapping methods and techniques, inherited from the pre-computer era. Even for Data Exploration, despite of advanced interactive features of modern hardware and software. These ways of graphical representation with a static design are often rigidly adhered to a specific data structure. With such advantages of compact illustration for print (where paper space is crucial), the statically charts are principally at disadvantage in compositional flexibility. Unlike a paper version, array of interactive capabilities plays an important role in chart implementation for screen displaying. The paper reviews an original approach to categorical data visualization, which takes into account features of the visual perception of form and color, as well as distribution and focusing characteristics of the visual attention, along with advantages of using the interactive computer graphics capabilities.

2013
This paper studies a MoodPic concept and a prototype implementation enabling collaborative creation of mood picture based musical play lists, evaluated qualitatively with 30 Finnish participants. In general, MoodPic was found to be a successful concept and stated to add novel experiences to music listening. Accessing music through mood pictures was highly appreciated and seen as a good way to discover new music over the genre boundaries and receive music recommendations from real users based on their mood picture interpretation. Sorting music based on mood pictures instead of genres was seen as an interesting and easy way to interact with music. Based on the interview results, this paper introduces several ideas for further improving the music listening experience using mood pictures as a basis for play lists. This paper summarizes the main findings and proposes an extensive set of generalized design implications to take into account when designing solutions for social music discovery.

Voronoi-Based Label Placement for Metro Maps
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2013
Metro maps with thumbnail photographs serve as common travel guides for providing sufficient information to meet the requirements of travelers in the cities. However, conventional methods attempt to minimize the total distance between stations and labels while maximizing the number of the labels rather than further taking into account the overall balance of the spatial distribution of labels. This paper presents an entropy-based approach for effectively annotating large annotation labels sufficiently close to the metro stations. Our idea is to decompose the entire labeling space intro regions bounded by the metro lines, and then further partition each region into Voronoi cells, each of which is reserved for a station to be annotated. This is accomplished by incorporating a new genetic-based optimization, while the fitness of the decomposition is evaluated by the entropy of the relative coverage ratios of such Voronoi cells. We also include several design examples to demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully distributes large labels around the metro network with minimal user intervention.

Time-Pie visualization: Providing Contextual Information for Energy Consumption Data
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2013
In recent years a growing number of information visualization systems have been developed to assist users with monitoring their energy consumption, with the hope of reducing energy use through more effective user-awareness. Most of these visualizations can be categorized into either some form of a time-series or pie chart, each with their own limitations. These visualization systems also often ignore incorporating contextual (e.g. weather, environmental) information which could assist users with better interpretation of their energy use information. In this paper we introduce the time-pie visualization technique, which combines the concepts of timeseries and pie charts, and allows the addition of contextual information to energy consumption data.

Interactive Curriculum Visualization
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2013
In curriculum visualization, information visualization techniques are used to communicate the structure and content of a curriculum to the stakeholders, such as students, lecturers, and administrators. Curriculum visualization has recently drawn a lot of interest as there are growing demands to form larger educational units and to find savings by eliminating overlap. We have developed a novel approach to analyse and visualize the contents of a curriculum.

How to Model a Customized Visualization
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Modelling a customized view is a daunting task that takes into account several parameters, the most important being the user profile. In this paper we study many facets of modelisation and the issues that must be taken into account. We propose an approach in four steps to model a personalised visualization: extract data, guess user's needs and preferences, generate a visualization and finally improve it by user evaluation. It has been applied to the context of weather information in Canada.

Pianola - Visualization of Multivariate Time-Series Security Event Data
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Monitoring log files for network intrusions is unwieldy. To build a mental model of the log, an analyst is required to recognise continuous timelines and attack patterns from a dataset that is essentially limited to an ordered list of events. Information Visualization techniques arrange data into directly perceivable visual patterns that may alleviate some overheads associated with interpreting these datasets and improve the ability of users, especially those in resource-stretched Small and Medium sized Businesses (SMBs), to make sense of activity patterns in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) event logs. To this end, we discuss existing network security visualizations for IDS logs and after examining the strengths and drawbacks of those applications we have prototyped a visualization tool, Pianola, that arranges events on multiple timelines to reveal patterns both in time and across a network. The tool was evaluated against the traditional use of command-line interface (CLI)-based tools for analyzing network security events and displayed significant improvements in both recognition and detection of attacks and reduction in the users' subjective workload, measured using the NASA Task Load index (TLX).

The structure of scientific co-authorship networks can reveal patterns of scientific collaboration. Our study focused on developing a methodology for community finding in co-authorship networks that could reveal the real, i.e., physical, patterns of scientific collaboration, by using two datasets with different collaboration scopes: one considering only collaborations within Japanese research institutions from different research areas, and the other comprising worldwide collaborations in the area of Computer Science.

Combining Scientific and Information Visualization Artifacts for Complex System Diagnosis
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Methodologies for complex systems diagnosis and verification have long been studied as part of systems engineering research. Most techniques involve decomposing the complex system into smaller connected components, and analyzing those. We describe the implementation and evaluation of a visualization tool which enhances drawings of physical components with information visualization artifacts for analyzing complex systems and their operating capability. Our visualization was designed to help users navigate through complex systems composed of multiple layers of components, identify if the system is ready to complete a task based on availability and performance of its components, and efficiently diagnose system malfunctions. A formal evaluation shows that our visualization tool enables users to diagnose complex systems faster than using conventional workflows.

Visualization of Multidimensional Sensor Data in Industrial Engineering

None
2013
Sensors have become increasingly deployed in many areas, and especially in industrial engineering settings. Sensor data is however temporal, massive, and multidimensional in nature. Such characteristics make it difficult to render sensor data for visual analysis. Although there exist potential visualizations for sensor data, there is very little specific guidance in literature on the visualization of sensor data in order to support industrial engineers in decision making. Existing visualizations are not always readily applicable to the domain of industrial engineering. This paper sheds more light on the area and proposes a visualization environment for supporting industrial engineers in their tasks.

2013
This work describes and evaluates a novel interactive visual clustering system. It combines a 2D projection with a clustering algorithm that operates on this projected data. Users can interact directly through the 2D representation, by providing examples according to their expert ground truth. Each interaction incrementally updates the 2D projection and the associated clustering. Experiments show the effectiveness of the method, with as few as one interaction leading to a tangible influence on the visualization.

Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction for Cluster Identification in Metagenomic Samples
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
We investigate the potential of modern nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques for an interactive cluster detection in bioinformatics applications. We demonstrate that recent non-parametric techniques such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) allow a cluster identification which is superior to direct clustering of the original data or cluster detection based on classical parametric dimensionality reduction approaches. Non-parametric approaches, however, display quadratic complexity which makes them unsuitable in interactive devices. As speedup, we propose kernel-t-SNE as a fast parametric counterpart based on t-SNE.

A Semi-supervised Approach to Visualizing and Manipulating Overlapping Communities
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
When evaluating a network topology, occasionally data structures cannot be segmented into absolute, heterogeneous groups. There may be a spectrum to the dataset that does not allow for this hard clustering approach and may need to segment using fuzzy/overlapping communities or cliques. Even to this degree, when group members can belong to multiple cliques, there leaves an ever present layer of doubt, noise, and outliers caused by the overlapping clustering algorithms. These imperfections can either be corrected by an expert user to enhance the clustering algorithm or to preserve their own mental models of the communities. Presented is a visualization that models overlapping community membership and provides an interactive interface to facilitate a quick and efficient means of both sorting through large network topologies and preserving the user's mental model of the structure.

Using Clustering to Improve Decision Trees Visualization

2013
Decision trees are simple and powerful decision support tools, and their graphical nature can be very useful for visual analysis tasks. However, decision trees tend to be large and hard to display when they are built from complex real world data. This paper proposes an original solution to optimize the visual representation of decision trees obtained from data. The solution combines clustering and feature construction, and introduces a new clustering algorithm that takes into account the visual properties and the accuracy of decision trees. A prototype has been implemented, and the benefits of the proposed method are shown using the results of several experiments performed on the UCI datasets.

Coordinating Multiple Views Using an Ontology-Based Semantic Mapping
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Multiple views of data sets from the same domain can support to discover unforeseen associations among data elements, but requires users to interact with them. The coordination mechanism must relate elements across multiple views. The mapping among data elements are constrained by using data attributes, and such mapping influences on how multiple views are coordinated. We propose the application of ontology to link data elements based on semantic for specific context. Representing the underlying data into ontology, semantic representation to create the mappings can benefit exploratory visualization. In this paper we show how to use ontology on coordinating multiple views, the initial results using document collections are presented and discussed, in comparison with traditional techniques.

The design of traffic management systems is challenging because of the large amount of dynamic data which has to be analysed by operators. Systems have to be designed appropriately to enable operators to react efficiently and quickly. The following paper gives an overview of guidelines derived from empirical research in cognitive psychology and HCI. These guidelines specifically address the design of traffic management systems. The following topics seem to be especially relevant: visual perception, geographic data, perception of motion, monitoring of tasks and interaction. These guidelines can help to design usable and useful systems.

Graph-Based Relational Data Visualization
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Relational databases are rigid-structured data sources characterized by complex relationships among a set of relations (tables). Making sense of such relationships is a challenging problem because users must consider multiple relations, understand their ensemble of integrity constraints, interpret dozens of attributes, and draw complex SQL queries for each desired data exploration. In this scenario, we introduce a twofold methodology, we use a hierarchical graph representation to efficiently model the database relationships and, on top of it, we designed a visualization technique for rapidly relational exploration. Our results demonstrate that the exploration of databases is deeply simplified as the user is able to visually browse the data with little or no knowledge about its structure, dismissing the need for complex SQL queries. We believe our findings will bring a novel paradigm in what concerns relational data comprehension.

Using Otsu's Threshold Selection Method for Eliminating Terms in Vector Space Model Computation
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Visualization techniques have proved to be valuable tools to support textual data exploration. Dimensionality reduction techniques have been widely used to produce visual representation of document collections. Focusing on multidimensional projection techniques, good visual results are produced depending on how representative terms to discriminate the documents are chosen to compose the vector space model (VSM). To define a good VSM it is necessary to apply filters during the preprocessing in order to eliminate terms using their frequency. For that, the user must evaluate the term frequency histogram based on his/her expertise in the text subject and decide the threshold value for frequency cut. Usually it is a trial and error approach that requires the user to verify the quality of visual representation after each trial. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach that applies the Otsu's Threshold Selection Method for computing a threshold using a term frequency histogram. We conducted experiments that have shown our approach generates visual representations as good as those generated with a threshold obtained by trial and error approach. The contribution of our approach is that users with non expertise are able to generate good visual representations and the time to get a good threshold is decreased.

In financial time series visual data analysis, there are many potential data elements to display, including continuous quantitative data and discrete event data. Bloomberg has designed and implemented a scalable visual representation for the depiction of many discrete time stamped events in use by hundreds of thousands of financial markets experts. This visualization enables a single screen to visually organize a large volume of event data, to facilitate inference through visual alignment of related data, and to provide a workflow from the single point of access to a wide variety of detailed information. It allows an order of magnitude more event types to be associated with time series data.

Visual attention and eye movement are important subjects of investigation with a wide area of application scenarios. The analysis of eye tracking data comprises examinations of differences between subjects and groups of subjects and identification of patterns and outliers within and between groups. To allow for such complex queries in an intuitive way, we present an interactive visual analysis tool using coordinated views. The views display areas of interest, statistical graphics of fixation times and time series and comprise novel visual encodings for spatiotemporal analysis and subject similarities. Interaction mechanisms allow for a refined analysis that takes into account all aspects of the data. We apply our approach to eye tracking data from psychological experiments and conduct a case study to demonstrate its effectiveness and intuitiveness.

A Visualization Architecture for Collaborative Analytical and Data Provenance Activities

2013
When exploring noisy or visually complex data, such as seismic data from the oil and gas industry, it is often the case that algorithms cannot completely identify features of interest. Human intuition must complete the process. Given the nature of intuition, this can be a source of differing interpretations depending on the human expert, thus we do not have a single feature but multiple views of a feature. Managing multi-user and multi-version interpretations, combined with version tracking, is challenging as these interpretations are often stored as geometric objects separately from the raw data and possibly in different local machines. In this paper we combine the storage of the raw data with the storage of the interpretations produced by the visualization of features by multiple user sessions. We present case studies that illustrate our system's ability to reproduce users' amendments to the interpretations of others and the ability to retrace the history of amendments to a visual feature.

Geovisual Analytics and Storytelling Using HTML5

The large and ever-increasing amounts of multivariate, multi-source, time-varying and geospatial digital information represent a major challenge for the analyst. The need to analyze and make decisions based on these information streams, often in time-critical situations, demands efficient, integrated and interactive visualization tools that aid the user to explore, present, collaborate and communicate visually large information spaces. This approach has been encapsulated in the idea of Geovisual Analytics, an interdisciplinary field that facilitates analytical reasoning through highly interactive visual interfaces and creative visualization of complex and dynamic data integrated with storytelling. Collaborative mapping is exemplified in this paper through telling stories about public statistics development over time that could shape, for example, economic growth and well-being. Discoveries are made that leave lasting impressions by stimulating the readers' curiosity making them want to learn more and convey a deeper meaning. In addition, the user can interactively participate in this web-based process which is important to the education and dissemination of public statistics. The storytelling mechanism assists the author to improve a reader's visual knowledge through reflections such as how life is lived by using a variety of demographics, such as healthcare, environment, and educational and economic indicators. Integrated snapshots can be captured at any time during the explorative data analysis process and thus become an important component of a storytelling reasoning process. The public can access Geovisual Analytics applications and explore statistical data relations on their own guided by the stories prepared by the experts. With the associated science of perception and cognition in relation to the use of multivariate spatial-temporal statistical data, this article contributes to the growing interest in visual storytelling engaging the public with new experiences.

We study in this paper the use of a 3D interface for OLAP. We analyze the state of the art in OLAP 3D visualizations. In a first step, we propose a new interface, called VR4OLAP, that combines the relative advantages of the studied methods. VR4OLAP can visualize 3 dimensions of an OLAP data cube and up to two measures. It represents the OLAP operators in the visualization with 3D widgets. It can use a 3D stereoscopic screen with a 3D mouse. In a second step, we perform a user study to evaluate this interface and to compare it with a standard cross-table. We evaluate the technical performances of the 3D interface. We conclude that, for the studied data and methods, 1) users are quite enthusiastic with a 3D representation, 2) the performances in 2D are equal or better than those obtained in 3D, 3) no advantage was found with the use of the 3D immersive setup.

We deal in this paper with the problem of creating an interactive and visual map for a large collection of Open datasets. We first describe how to define a representation space for such data, using text mining techniques to create features. Then, with a similarity measure between Open datasets, we use the k-nearest neighbors method for building a proximity graph between datasets. We use a force-directed layout method to visualize the graph (Tulip Software). We present the results with a collection of 293,000 datasets from the French Open data web site, in which the display of the graph is limited to 151,000 datasets. We study the discovered clusters and we show how they can be used to browse this large collection.

Visual Data-Driven Profiling of Green Consumers
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2013
There is an increasing interest in green consumer behavior. These consumers are ecologically conscious and interested in buying environmentally friendly products. Earlier efforts at identifying these consumers have relied upon questionnaires based on demographic and psychographic data. Most of the studies have concluded that it is not possible to identify a unanimous profile for a green consumer, because: (1) there might be several profiles for green consumers, and (2) in questionnaires, consumers tend to answer according to their intentions, not according to actual behavior. We apply a new method, the Weighted Self-Organizing Map (WSOM) for visual customer segmentation in order to profile green consumers. The consumers are identified through a data-driven analysis based on actual transaction data, including both demographic and behavioral information. The WSOM accounts for the 'degree' of how green a consumer is by giving a larger weight to consumers who buy more green products. The identified profiles are verified by comparison to earlier research.

Current Work Practice and Users' Perspectives on Visualization and Interactivity in Business Intelligence

2013
Business Intelligence (BI) provides methods for analyzing business-critical information and supports decision-making processes. Interactivity or the possibility to engage in an active discourse with the representation lies at the core of Information Visualization and Visual BI. However, current work practice and users' perspectives on visualization and interactivity in BI have not been investigated yet. As a first step in this direction, a qualitative empirical study was conducted among six IT-managers working in the field of BI. Main results are that interactive visual methods in BI are not used very often in practice. One of the main reasons reported is the fact that visualization is still two steps ahead and at the moment mostly more basic problems concerning data gathering, data modeling and data quality prevail. Moreover, most users are used to work with numbers and tables and are not aware of the possibilities in terms of visualization. However, the interviewed IT-managers acknowledged that using more interactive visual methods in BI would be beneficial for users.

A Visual Approach to Project and Portfolio Monitoring

Project managers increasingly rely on software support for monitoring status and development of projects gathered in large portfolios. The status of a project is characterized by a large number of mostly numerical parameters. Various chart visualisations are commonly used to express parameters, provide aggregation and support comparison. We propose a visual representation which encodes the parameters defining a project's status into a single project symbol. We also propose to visualise project portfolios by applying a two-dimensional layout to collections of project symbols. The resulting project portfolio visualisations empower users to monitor the progress and status of each project, discover outliers, and identify project groups sharing common properties. A user evaluation of the project symbol and of the portfolio visualisations was performed providing directions for further improvements.

Social entrepreneurship is an emerging field which has the power to change the way we do business and resolve societal challenges. Visualization has not yet been systematically applied to support social entrepreneurs in creating, growing and scaling their ventures. We thus propose a framework for the use of knowledge visualization in the creation and development of social enterprises. We posit that each phase of the social venturing process requires a different knowledge visualization method. These diverse types of (interactive) graphic representations help social entrepreneurs cope with resource constraints and interact with a great variety of stakeholders. In this contribution we thus show that knowledge visualization can provide versatile and inexpensive ways to augment social entrepreneurs' activities systematically.

The Role of Direct Manipulation of Visualizations in the Development and Use of Multi-level Knowledge Models
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
The proliferation of touch sensitive display screens has created a new generation of human-computer interaction styles which are so natural and common that even the youngest of users now perceive ordinary static media like a glossy magazine as a broken iPad. The volume of users who expect to be able to pinch, grab, twist and manipulate images on screen is rapidly growing; they drive a renewed interest in developing, assessing, and delivering new direct manipulation systems. Our premise is that one can exploit new technologies to develop new repertoires of direct manipulation, but with increasing pressure to provide semantically-coupled direct manipulation methods to experiment with computational information models. We develop this premise by noting highlights in the evolution of direct manipulation interfaces, and suggest that their selection and deployment can be tailored as visual experiments to debug and extend more complex computational models of information systems and processes. These systems and processes include those of natural systems such as arise in systems biology (e.g., modelling multiple levels of protein structure), but also in "unnatural" systems such as in the identification of hubs and authorities in artificial systems like the World Wide Web (WWW). The immediate consequence of our premise suggests that the design of direct manipulation tools should proceed with the semantics of the modelled systems in mind, so that each users' manipulations provide a new perspective on the concept of "data mining" of large data sets. This will allow users to not just expose implicit relationships, but to incrementally combine explanatory and exploratory investigation by direct manipulation, to adjust and improve the computational knowledge models that emerge from the underlying data.

Visualizing Conceptual Relations in Legal Terminology
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Underlying all specialized terminology is a concept system, which is particularly important in the legal domain. However, this concept system is not explicitly available in terminology management systems. We present a tool that analyzes the relations in a terminological database and presents an interactive visualization of those relations. This tool helps terminologists manage their information, including quality assurance and analysis of the information, as well as aiding in didactic presentations of terminology work.

An Experimental Evaluation on the Impact of Visual Facilitation Modes on Idea Generation in Teams
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
In this study we examine the effect of visual facilitation mode on perceived team creativity and satisfaction, as well as on idea diversity. In an experimental study with 73 real-life managers, we have compared three facilitation conditions for team-based business model innovation sessions: graphic facilitation with a fixed poster template, software based facilitation with a visual creativity process, and self-facilitated flip chart sessions. Based on activity theory, we hypothesize that visual groups outperform the control groups. Teams were given one hour to develop novel ideas for the business model of a daily newspaper. The statistical analysis of the survey-based feedback from the participants reveals that facilitation mode has a significant effect on the perceived team process. Specifically, visual approaches seem to increase constructive teamwork, and - if software supported - also perceived team creativity and process satisfaction. However, analyzing the generated ideas, we did not find differences with regard to idea diversity. Result satisfaction was also not significantly higher in visual groups. Based on these results, we generate a number of possible explanations that can be tested in future studies.

10 Years after Tufte's "Cognitive Style of PowerPoint": Synthesizing its Constraining Qualities
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
PowerPoint is a tool that is very often used in organization to visualize knowledge. It is seemingly simple but a complex tool which is not 'neutral' but has enabling and constraining qualities. Despite its pervasiveness, research on PowerPoint is scarce, fragmented and often polemic. Given its omnipresence and importance, a more appropriate understanding of the tool is needed. This paper aims to contribute toward this goal by conducting a literature review on the constraining qualities of PowerPoint in a systematic manner. The results are synthesized into 12 constraining qualities and classified into two levels: the tool itself and the enactment of the tool in the performance. Through the synthesis and description of the constraining qualities and their negative effects, this paper aims to provide guidance to practitioners for the preparation, performance and reception of PowerPoint presentations, with the ultimate goal to select and use this presentation tool more consciously, or to select other tools for knowledge visualization.

A Typology for Data Visualization on the Web
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
The need to visualize data has emerged from the research field, it has been a useful tool to the study of scientific problems. However the truth is that data visualization is a great way to present data for any area dealing with information, because visually presented information is not only more appealing due to its use of pictograms and colours, but also more efficient in conveying large amounts of information. Throughout the years there have been efforts to develop a classification for these visualizations, in order to provide a better understanding of this way to present data. There are many different classifications but none of them is fully complete. In this paper it is discussed and developed a typology for online data visualization and info graphics. Such a typology will be relevant for a better understanding of what kinds of visualizations exist and in further research to better identify which elements compose a good visualization that is pleasing to the public.

The concepts of virtues and vices have a long history. This paper discusses their medieval metaphorical and allegorical representations as examples of knowledge visualizations, and compares them against the criteria put forward for the use of contemporary knowledge visualizations. It is found that these medieval visualizations exhibit all the essential traits expected of knowledge visualizations, making them not only exemplars of a field, but also documentary evidence of early explorations (research) into visually representing and communicating complex knowledge.

A Mathematical Look to the World

When using visualisations to explore mathematics, I was seduced by their aesthetics. It led me to see them as a form of art and to start to produce mathematical visualisations just for the sake of it. I began to study the interactions between mathematics and art. At the same time, I discovered that mathematicians have a very special way to look to the world. This paper is an account of my research in the matter.

Magic Squares and Aesthetic Events
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
We consider an approach to generative art which exploits the structure of magic squares as a generative engine. Magic squares are used for image generation by mapping their properties into visual schemes. Our underlying hypothesis is that order in some form can serve as a prerequisite for a particular set of aesthetic events. By resorting to a mathematical structure that is not formulated as a function, but for which an inherent order is present, we reduce the most difficult task in generative art, the design of a generative system, to the much easier task of designing representational schemes for the visualization of number patterns. A set of schemes to achieve this task has been realized within a joint project between programmers and artists. The results of this project are discussed and illustrated.

Colored Mosaic Matrix: Visualization Technique for High-Dimensional Data
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Owing to a limited display resolution, it may be difficult to obtain an overview of high-dimensional data in the display area used for visualization. In this paper, we aimed to obtain an overview of high-dimensional data in a limited screen area. We developed Colored Mosaic Matrix as a method to obtain a data overview. Colored Mosaic Matrix is a visualization method for high-dimensional categorical data that uses a color representation of the features. By representing quantitative data in category units, the proposed method enables the visualization of data containing a large number of records. As a result of an experimental investigation of its readability, we found our method to be useful in obtaining a data overview.

Web3DGIS for City Models with CityGML and X3D
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2013
There is an increasing interest in 3D Geographical Information Systems which leads to the development of web based technologies for visualization, interaction and query of 3D city models. The Open Geographic Consortium developed the City Geography Markup Language as an industry standard for the modeling of city objects. The web 3D Consortium established the eXtendable 3D standard for display of 3D scenes over the internet. This paper presents a Web3DGIS system that loads a cityGML model and convert it to a X3D model. This model can be viewed in the web. Moreover, it also allows the query about attributes and adjacency relationships of features in GIS data sets. For this Web3DGIS it was used X3D, WebGL and X3DOM. Such solution does not require any additional plug-ins or components.

The Effect of Stereoscopic Immersive Environments on Projection-Based Multi-dimensional Data Visualization
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Multidimensional data impose a challenge for visual analyses. Commonly, dimensionality reduction techniques are used to project the multidimensional data into a 2D visual space. Poco et al. [9] showed that projection into a 3D visual space can increase the performance of common visual analysis tasks due to a higher projection precision. They also backed up their findings with a user study. However, when conducting the user study they displayed the 3D visual space on a 2D screen, which may impede the correct perception of the third dimension. In this paper, we present a study that investigates the effect of stereoscopic environments when used for the visual analysis of multidimensional data after projection into a 3D visual space. We conducted a controlled user study to compare correctness, timing, and confidence in segregation and precision tasks when performed in stereoscopic immersive environments and on a nonstereoscopic 2D screen. In terms of the stereoscopic immersive environments, we operated on and compared results obtained with two setup: a single screen and a six-sided highly immersive system, in both of which interaction was performed with a 3D input device. We investigated whether the stereoscopic immersive environments have an effect on user performance depending on the visual encodings. We used both 3D scatter plots and cluster visualizations in the form of enclosing surfaces or hulls for the visual analysis tasks.

A Reference Image Generation Method for Marker-less AR
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
In this paper, we present a marker-less AR framework which enables virtual graffiti creation and reference image generation. Our framework also supports 3D annotations such as image textures (virtual graffiti), 3D objects and 3D text, which are superposed over the video stream. We adopt marker-less tracking technique based on key point based descriptors and the trackers. In general, reference image for marker-less AR must be acquired from real image in advance. In such situation, most marker-less tracking approaches force user to capture the front view of a target object. We suppose that reference image does not have to be captured under such condition. In experiments, we showed the estimation accuracy for reference image generation. And we demonstrated real-time marker-less tracking including reference image generation, easy-to-use virtual graffiti creation and immediate superimposing.

One Graph, Multiple Drawings

None
2013
Being able to produce a wide variety of layouts for a same graphs may prove useful when users have no preferred visual encoding for their data. The first contribution of this paper is a enhanced force-directed layout capable of producing different layouts of a same graph. We turn a well known force-directed algorithm (GEM) into a highly parametrizable layout and control it from a genetic algorithm framework. The genetic algorithm allows to efficiently explore the parameter space of this highly parametrisable layout. The search process relies on the capability of the system to evaluate the similarity between two drawings. The second contribution of this paper is a similarity metric used as a fitness function for the genetic algorithm. Its main features are its computational cost and its insensitivity to planar homotheties.

Extending the H-Tree Layout Pedigree: An Evaluation
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Visualizing large family structures is becoming increasingly important, as more genealogical data becomes available. A space-filling h-tree layout pedigree has been recently proposed to make better use of the available space than traditional representations. In a previous paper we applauded the technique's usage of available space but remarked that it makes generation identification difficult and does not allow navigating to descendants of represented individuals. A set of extensions was proposed to help overcome these limitations and a preliminary evaluation suggested that those extensions enhance the original technique. This paper presents a more thorough evaluation carried out to assess if and how the proposed extensions improve the original h-tree layout pedigree technique. Results suggest that these extensions improve user performance on some tasks, effectively provide new functionality, and generally enhance user experience.

Shortest Path Approach to Edge Routing
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Traditionally, drawing of edges is performed together with drawing of nodes. However, there are situations where positions of the nodes are fixed, e.g., when the positions are defined by the user or a separate algorithm. An example of this situation is a database schema editor, where user positions the nodes (i.e., visual representations of definitions of individual database tables) according to their meaning, for example grouping them according to sub domains of the problem. In this case, we only need to draw the edges but we must do that in such a way that the lines that represent these edges do not cross the rectangles that represent the nodes -- we need to perform some kind of edge routing. This paper describes an algorithm that performs edge routing in such a way that the lengths of the polylines it produces are minimal. We also describe several ways of improving the performance of the basic algorithm so that it can be used even for interactive graph visualization and manipulation, which is necessary in our scenario. Then, we show several post-processing steps that are used to turn the results of the algorithm into a usable visualization.

Initial Positioning Method for Online and Real-Time Dynamic Graph Drawing of Time Varying Data
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Microblogging services generate huge histories that suit animated visualization based on graph drawing, but response speeds are insufficient. This paper proposes an effective updating method for the real-time visualization of time varying data. We propose an initial positioning method by combining Additional Edge Resizing (AER) with Sorted Sequential Barycenter Merging (SSBM). AER resizes edges between existing nodes when new edges are added before updating the visualization. SSBM initially positions multiple new nodes sequentially through priority based on the degree of connections to the existing graph. The proposed method prevents a decrease in readability at data update and achieves fast convergence with high accuracy. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the energy function and RMSE are detailed along with some visualization results. A graph drawing tool based on HTML5 is also introduced as an implementation of the proposed method and present some use cases for twitter data.

This paper presents ongoing research aimed at improving surveying education through the use of virtual environments. Teaching surveying presents several challenges such as low student competence in mathematics, geometry and trigonometry, limited student access to instruments, limited availability of terrains on which to practice, dependency on weather conditions, and more. Prior research suggests that surveying education can be significantly improved with the use of digital teaching aids and virtual instruments. The goal of the work reported in the paper is to enhance traditional surveying instruction methods with a unique approach: an interactive Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) that supports students' mathematical representational fluency and includes realistic virtual terrains and surveying instruments that look, operate, and produce results comparable to the physical ones. The VLE is aimed at undergraduate students enrolled in Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Construction Management programs and includes 5 educational modules, in this paper we describe the design, development and initial evaluation of the "Triangulations and Coordinates Calculations" module.

Heat map based data visualization and mining is an emerging area in game engine design and architecture. Employed by many state of the art game engines and popular commercial games, this technology helps populate and collate player activity and behavior to better inform the system for further action. Simulation and serious games can tremendously benefit by applying heat map based visualization for the purposes of analyzing and tracking player behavior. Heat maps are time varying texture maps that represent a chosen activity over a certain grid at any particular interval of elapsed time. In this paper results of applying a real-time heat map data capture and generation tool on two military simulations: 1) Ground-based combat scenario and 2) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle sensor operator scenario is presented. The research showcases several real-time visualization techniques developed into the simulation with the main goal of understanding participant behavior.

This work presents an ongoing work on a new approach to perform craniometric analysis based on contactless 3D modelling of skulls. Beside the acquisition process with a 3D range sensor and initial results in the semi-automatic detection of features in the skulls, we also present some results in the development of a 3D interactive interface that eases interaction for users with little experience on digital 3D manipulation. The final objective is to provide an easy to use 3D interface to allow semi-automatic detection of features in skulls. It is our belief that this system might be the first step towards a new methodology for craniometric analysis that can solve several of the current problems such as repeatability, wide access to skull information or bone damage during measurements.

Cave Chamber Data Modeling and 3D Web Visualization

Underground caves and its specific structures are important for geomorphological studies. In this paper we present tools to identify and map speleothems by surveying cave chambers interiors. The cave chamber was surveyed using Terrestrial Laser Scanning to acquire point clouds with high level of detail for 3D model generation. This data with 45 million points is useful for either reconstruction, geomorphological studies or virtual visits of caves. With this point cloud we generated a 3D-mesh to represent the surface model of the cave chamber, which is important to study its geomorphological features. A topological structure of the 3D-mesh was also implemented to get an efficient algorithm to help identifying stalactites. The possibility to publish 3D data on the Web is of particular interest for the geospatial field. For this reason, it was decided to make the cave model available in the Web by developing a 3D graphical interface where users can navigate and interact with the three-dimensional models of the cave. For this Web3D framework it was used X3D, WebGL and X3DOM. Such solution does not require any additional plug-ins or components.

Robust and Sparse RGBD Data Registration of Scene Views

2013
This paper proposes a complete strategy to optimally filter, enhance and register 3D point clouds captured by commodity RGBD cameras. Starting from the raw data grabbed from multiple viewpoints, we build the scene that gathers all the clouds in one consistent view. The process begins with the innovative adaptation of Kalman filter to Kinect's output. The resulting point cloud is subject to an outlier removal technique and a pre-alignment based on 3D features is performed. Finally, the alignment is refined using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The output of this research work is a consistent 3D model which can be directly used in virtual reality applications, or any 3D rendering process. Test results on real data are presented to validate our approach, and to justify the choice of its different modules.

We have developed an Origami system in which we can fold a sheet of paper freely. In mathematical model, two held sides of paper can be overlapped flatly. However, in real paper, the sides often make a gap between them because of physical restrictions. In this paper, we formalize &#x201C;folding&#x201D; in Origami and discuss how to make such &#x201C;gap&#x201D; in 3D Origami simulation system to make it more realistic. We apply a biphase model, which consists of two models. One of them is mathematical model for managing folding, and the other is graphical gap-model for representing Origami with gaps. We show Origami figures made by the two models and discuss the effect of the method we applied and some problems to be solved.

The objective of this paper is to report on the development of prototype models for use in raising public awareness of changes in rural areas, focusing on green spaces, and testing responses to scenarios of change. Specifically, the focus is on the design of appropriate types and speeds of movement of features. This modelling is done using the Maya and ArcGIS software packages together in a novel combination of spatial and visualisation tools. The experiment results show evidence that different types of animation with interactive communication will influence participation and decision making in land use planning.

Laplacian Musculoskeletal Deformation for Patient-Specific Simulation and Visualisation
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
In many biomedical applications, it is often desired to simulate, analyse and visualise the dynamics of a particular patient based on a patient-specific musculoskeletal model. However, reconstructing a patient-specific model directly from medical images is highly labour intensive, and impractical in the clinical context. A more efficient method is to derive it from an atlas musculoskeletal model using patient-specific hints. In this paper, Laplacian mesh processing is introduced to deform an atlas model to a patient-specific model, based on patient-specific landmarks extracted from two orthogonal clinical images and using least-squares error optimization. Muscle attachment landmarks and motion landmarks in the atlas are also transformed as part of the process. Drift and inter-surface penetrations are prevented by supplementary inter-surface landmarks. Mesh simplification and reconstruction are used to avoid out-of-memory failures that may result from trying to deform models at high resolution.

Trend Analysis Tool with Simultaneous Visualization of Rank and Value
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
In this paper, a technique for visualizing the changing rank and value of events simultaneously with time, as well as a trend analysis tool that uses the resulting visualization, are proposed. This technique facilitates analysts' understanding of the trends of both the entire data set and each event. It also uses colors, which are estimated automatically from the events' text labels, to represent the category to which events belong. Using the tool, the authors analyzed trends of topic data extracted from Twitter as use case, and could observe the trends and overview of Twitter. In addition, using the tool it is possible to present the different ways in which people who use different media think, using media-generated data.

Using a Serious Game Approach to Teach 'Operator Precedence' to Introductory Programming Students
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
In this paper we describe the design, development, formative evaluation and initial findings of one level of a serious game whose objective is to teach Information Assurance concepts to undergraduate students in introductory programming courses. The game level focuses on the concept of 'operator precedence'. The player travels through a multilevel 3- dimensional maze and at each junction in the maze he/she is required to solve a mathematical problem that involves the application of operator precedence rules. A correct answer allows the player to move closer to the maze exit, an incorrect solution moves the player farther from the end of the maze. Initial findings from a formative study with a group of 14 undergraduate students show that the game level is usable, engaging and useful for learning/reviewing the intended programming concept.

Extracting Hidden Information and Conclusions in Software Testing Via Distributed Relational Visual Mining
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Visual Mining is typically concerned with the visualization of data and its representation to facilitate the mining aiming at extracting interesting and hidden information. It can also mean the visualization of the results of the mining process with the purpose of deepening the understanding of such results and maximizing its exploitation. However, in global systems and global economies, the targeted knowledge of interest may not be embedded in one database or data system. Instead, it may be hidden, not in the data sets, but in the relations between seemingly unrelated data systems. We introduce this problem and the concept of Distributed Relational Visual Mining and its potential for information and knowledge discovery from distributed seemingly disconnected systems. With potential applications in many areas, we introduce a case study applying the proposed technique in the area of Software Development in general and Software testing in Particular.

Cluster Coloring of the Self-Organizing Map: An Information Visualization Perspective
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
This paper takes an information visualization perspective to visual representations in the general SOM paradigm. This involves viewing SOM-based visualizations through the eyes of Bertin's and Tufte's theories on data graphics. The regular grid shape of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), while being a virtue for linking visualizations to it, restricts representation of cluster structures. From the viewpoint of information visualization, this paper provides a general, yet simple, solution to projection-based coloring of the SOM that reveals structures. First, the proposed color space is easy to construct and customize to the purpose of use, while aiming at being perceptually correct and informative through two separable dimensions. Second, the coloring method is not dependent on any specific method of projection, but is rather modular to fit any objective function suitable for the task at hand. The cluster coloring is illustrated on two datasets: the iris data, and welfare and poverty indicators.

Comparison of Advanced and Standard Real-Time 3D Rendering Methods for Interactive Landscapes (Short Paper Version)
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
The use of games-based visualisation technology allows for the development of sophisticated interactive 3D decision support tools. Components of these tools are the various real-time rendering methods that are implemented to facilitate the interactive 3D aspect of the visualisations. Modern graphics hardware allows for the implementation of both simple and complex GPU shader programs. Shaders can be used to compute material and lighting properties that can greatly influence the visual style of a 3D scene. The research presented here shows that more sophisticated 3D shading methods increase user preference when used to render close up scenes. The research also shows that simpler shading methods can still be used to render distant scenes with less visual details present.

Categorisation of Audience Relationship between Action and Visualisation in Interactive Art Installations
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
The aim of this paper is to categorise audience participation in interactive art according to a visualisation method. The research studied categories of audience in interactivities and applied artworks at the 7th Seoul Media Art Biennale. To establish the method of categorisation, the participation of the audience is classified into two factors: 'to act' or 'to be represented' in the visualisation realm. Based on these two factors, the research proposed a new graph for visualisation of human action in interactive art, categorising interactive art into four categories. The audience in interactive artwork performs the following roles: object, coordinator, transformer, character. Ultimately, this research predicts the meaning of the human being in virtual reality and utilises basic categories to visualise audience actions.

A Linked Visualization of Trajectory and Flow Quantity to Support Analysis of People Flow
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
Thanks to the recent evolution of movie- and sensor-based human tracking technologies, we can obtain and accumulate a set of walking paths ("trajectories" in this paper) of people over a long period in various places. Such people flow datasets are useful for many fields, including analyses of customer behavior, effectiveness of advertisements, and operational efficiency. This paper presents a linked visualization system to assist in the discovery of new knowledge by analyzing the accumulated people flow datasets, and a case study using this system. In this study we suppose the people flow datasets consist of a set of trajectories and temporal flow quantity. The system consists of two visualization components: classified trajectory visualization, and temporal flow quantity visualization. The former component classifies trajectories into several patterns applying the spectral clustering algorithm, and visualizes the patterns by colors on a physical space. The latter component displays temporal flow quantity of the above patterns applying a piled polygonal chart. This paper introduces a case study applying a movie-based human tracking dataset to the presented system.

Visualizing Time-Varying Topics Via Images and Texts for Inter-Media Analysis
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
This paper proposes a system for analyzing societal behaviors by visualizing time-varying topics in multiple media. Various types of content such as text, images, and videos have spread throughout multiple media, such as TV and the Web, that have complementary information and influence one another. It is important to compare how these media react to real world events to understand recent societal behaviors and how each medium reacts to other media. Our system visualizes flows of content in multiple media in 3D space enabling us to simultaneously explore them. We present two example applications using our system. The first involves the visualization of inter-media events comparing the exposure of topics in TV news and the activities of bloggers. The second example application is a system for visualizing visual trends on social media that chronologically displays extracted clusters of images on blogs. The proposed systems enable users to visually monitor changes in thought, activities, and interests of people, and differences between media through interactively exploring flows of texts and images extracted from the media.

Visualisation of Association Rules Based on a Molecular Representation
2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2013
In order to extract interesting knowledge from large amounts of rules produced by the data mining algorithms, visual representations of association rules are increasingly used. These representations can help users to find and to validate interesting knowledge. All techniques proposed for visualisation of rules have been developed to represent an association rule as a whole without paying attention to the relations among the items that make up the antecedent and the consequent and the contribution of each one to the rule. In this paper, we propose a new visualisation representation for association rules that allows the visualisation of the items which make up the antecedent and the consequent, the contribution of each one to the rule, and the correlations between each pair of the antecedent and each pair of consequent.

2013
At So&#x0301;lheimajo&#x0308;kull glacier in southern Iceland, field evidence has been collected of a Tenth Century jo&#x0308;kulhlaup (or glacial outburst flood). It was an exceptional event in terms of generation, scale, magnitude and geomorphic impact. Although now fragmented and piecemeal, many of its direct (and indirect) geomorphological and sedimentary markers have been identified, mapped and dated to unravel the sequence of events played out during this significant episode in the glacial history. 'VolcVis', an innovative, customised visualisation platform using computer gaming technology is developed and applied for the first time in coalescing and displaying field results from So&#x0301;lheimajo&#x0308;kull, creating an interactive, multi-perspective, three-dimensional (3D) prototype model. A visual simulation of So&#x0301;lheimajo&#x0308;kull's Tenth Century physical environment places the flood into geomorphic and topographic context. This ability to dynamically display and interpret field data presents new possibilities for testing hypotheses, and for data sharing with Icelandic hazard mitigation authorities and the general public.

Visual Clustering for Large Scale Commercial Enterprises

Clustering is a well established data exploration and analysis method. It allows interactive discovery and interpretation of groups of entities that have similar properties and characteristics. However, deriving meaningful insights from clusters often presents challenges in large sets of structurally complex data. Large scale commercial enterprises hold an increasing volume of complex, highly-dimensional data. In order to effectively analyze this data and create meaningful clusters from it, pre-processing the data prior to clustering is essential. Once clusters are created, interpretation and representation of clusters is equally essential to capture insights that can aid corporate decision making. In this paper, we present a generic approach to data preparation and cluster interpretation implemented on a large scale enterprise database.

Using Visual Cues on DOITree for Visualizing Large Hierarchical Data

2014
This paper extends a previous work on node link tree visualization and interaction by providing visual clues on hidden structures. We adopt the effectiveness of DOI Tree, a multi-focal tree layout algorithm, for exploring large hierarchical structures. The advantages of visualization are its most familiar mapping for users, its capability on providing multiple focused nodes, and its dynamic rescaling of substructures to fit the available space. By providing various methods of topological previews of substructure including simple icon view, tree view and tree map view, we provide better understanding the topology of hidden branches.

Spectral-Based Contractible Parallel Coordinates
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
Parallel coordinates is well-known as a popular tool for visualizing the underlying relationships among variables in high-dimension datasets. However, this representation still suffers from visual clutter arising from intersections among poly line plots especially when the number of data samples and their associated dimension become high. This paper presents a method of alleviating such visual clutter by contracting multiple axes through the analysis of correlation between every pair of variables. In this method, we first construct a graph by connecting axis nodes with an edge weighted by data correlation between the corresponding pair of dimensions, and then reorder the multiple axes by projecting the nodes onto the primary axis obtained through the spectral graph analysis. This allows us to compose a dendrogram tree by recursively merging a pair of the closest axes one by one. Our visualization platform helps the visual interpretation of such axis contraction by plotting the principal component of each data sample along the composite axis. Smooth animation of the associated axis contraction and expansion has also been implemented to enhance the visual readability of behavior inherent in the given high-dimensional datasets.

2014
Clustered graph drawing is widely considered as a good method to overcome the scalability problem when visualizing large (or huge) graphs. Force-directed algorithm is a popular approach for laying graphs yet small to medium size datasets due to its slow convergence time. This paper proposes a new method which combines clustering and a force-directed algorithm, to reduce the computational complexity and time. It works by dividing a Long Convergence: LC into two Short Convergences: SC1, SC2, where SC1+SC2 &lt;; LC. We also apply our work on weighted graphs. Our experiments show that the new method improves the aesthetics in graph visualization by providing clearer views for connectivity and edge weights.

How to Tell Stories Using Visualization

2014
The benefits of storytelling's are long-known and its potential to simplify concepts, create emotional connection, and capacity to help retain information has been explored in different areas, such as journalism, education, and others. The necessity to incorporate storytelling in visualizations arises from the need to share complex data in a way that is engaging. Advances in technology have enabled us to go beyond the traditional forms of storytelling and representing data, giving us more attractive and sophisticated means to tell stories.In this paper, we present the results of a focus group study that was conducted with the purpose of collecting information on the narrative elements in a collection of visualizations and the possible inclusion of storytelling elements in those. In this study information about the visualizations in terms of comprehension, navigation, and likability was also collected with the intent of identifying elements that are appealing in the visualizations. Furthermore, we suggest strategies for storytelling in visualizations.

Graph Exploration by Multiple Linked Metric Views
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
The visualization of relational data by node-link diagrams quickly leads to a degradation of performance at some exploration tasks when the diagrams show visual clutter and overdraw. To address this challenge of large-data graph visualization, we introduce Graph Metric Views, a technique that enriches the visualization of traditional layout strategies for node-link diagrams by additionally allowing an analyst to interactively explore graph-specific metrics such as number of nodes, number of link crossings, link coverage, or degree of orthogonality. To this end, we support an analyst with additional histogram-like representations at the axes of the display space for graph-specific metrics. In this way, a cluttered and densely packed node-link diagram becomes more explorable even for dense graph regions: The user can use the distribution of metric values as an overview and then select regions of interest for further investigation and filtering.

The Challenge of Semantic Symmetry in Visualization
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
We present a fundamental problem which arises within an emerging theory of visualization, and provide examples that illustrate the challenge of what we call semantic symmetry. This theory of visualization distinguishes data domains (e.g., Numbers and symbols) from picture domains (e.g., Shapes, shading, colour), and provides a framework for specifying a variety of mappings between data and picture domains. Visualization is about enabling inferences about data within the human visual system, so crucially depends on the management of mappings from the data to the picture domain. But there are many possible choices for these mappings, and only in the last decade has there emerged any serious assessment of how one might measure the quality of a visualization. The situation is further complicated by what is now called visual analytics, where data to picture mappings allow manipulation of that picture to further understand or reveal the underlying data relationships. This kind of picture manipulation is exactly the departure point for our presentation of the problem of semantic symmetry. Semantic symmetry considers the problem of how to couple data and picture so that changes in one are accurately reflected in the other. We illustrate the foundational nature of the problems arising from the desire for semantic symmetry, and explain the kinds of constraints and framework that are necessary in order to be able to support a more complete theory of visualization.

A New Scheme for Trajectory Visualization
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
This paper proposes a new approach for trajectory clustering and visualization. During clustering, speed and direction are both taken into account as the important properties of a trajectory. Additionally, the temporal change of the trajectories is explicitly considered in the procedure of clustering. Importantly, we introduce the uncertainty to represent the homogeneity of the updating trajectories based on their speed and direction attributes, to help observe and understand the happening of the trajectory data. Finally, based on the use of the HSV color space, we devise three patterns for graphically presenting the trajectory data in different perspectives. Namely, 'H+S' visualizes the clustered trajectories emphasizing the speed attribute of them. 'H+S+Update' depicts more information on the "latest" trajectory data, compared with the results by 'H+S'. 'H+V+Update' explicitly presents the uncertainty of the trajectory data. Our approach has shown its potential for the effective trajectory analysis.

Narrative Visualization: A Case Study of How to Incorporate Narrative Elements in Existing Visualizations
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2014
Stories have long been used to convey information, cultural values, and experiences. Narratives not only have been the main way people make sense of the world, but also have been the easiest way humans found out to share complex information. However, today we are confronted with the problem of the amount of information available, which sometimes is hard to cope with. Combining storytelling with visualization has been pointed out as an efficient method to represent and make sense of data, at the same time allowing people to relate with the information. In this paper, we explore the benefits of adding storytelling to visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research websites, we identified possible strategies to introduce storytelling in visualizations such as adding short stories or narrative elements using annotations and using time to introduce the feeling of storytelling or story-flow.

Partial Link Drawings for Nodes, Links, and Regions of Interest
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2014
Partially drawn links in graph visualizations have been introduced as a concept for further reducing visual clutter caused by many link crossings in combination to a formerly applied layout algorithm focusing on aesthetic graph drawing criteria. Although this visualization strategy has been shown to be useful for a faster and more accurate visual exploration of node-link diagrams in some scenarios, it has not been integrated into a graph visualization tool as an interaction feature to this end. Apart from representing the entire displayed graph in the partially drawn link style we allow the viewer to apply this feature to several nodes, links, or regions of interest. To avoid possible ambiguities introduced by the disconnectedness of start and target nodes further interaction techniques can be applied to mitigate this situation by showing the complete link information for single selected vertices or edges again.

MetricAttitude is a visualization tool based on static analysis that provides a mental picture by viewing an object-oriented software system by means of polymetric views. In this paper, we present a preliminary empirical investigation based on a questionnaire-based survey to assess Metric Attitude with respect to source code comprehension tasks. Participants involved in this study were Computer Science students and software professionals. The results suggest that Metric Attitude is a viable means to comprehend source code and that both kinds of participants in the empirical investigation considered it to be appropriate in source code comprehension.

Students in Transit: Understanding the Migration of Students between Disciplines and Disciplinary Groupings
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
In this paper we investigate methods for visualizing the flow of university-level students through the undergraduate academic experience. We use the lens of transit between major declarations, both in the context of specific major to major mappings, as well as mappings between disciplinary clusters. Our motivation is twofold. First, we wish to understand the implications for students, in terms of time to degree, fidelity to initial major interest, and intellectual distance travelled by students as they cross boundaries of major clusters. Second, we wish to understand the implications for degree programs, as they seek to attract and retain top students, or manage the consequences of declining enrollments. Our approach utilizes multiple visualization techniques, as we first try and develop high-level understanding of the migratory patterns of students, and then drill down to more fine-grained approaches yielding insights that are aimed at providing specific, actionable information to a diverse set of stakeholders, including students, faculty, and administrators.

The wide availability of database systems and low cost of hardware allow enterprises and researchers the opportunity to store large data collections. The challenge then became the understanding of these data. To overcome this problem Information Visualization (IV) techniques have been employed to amplify the human cognitive ability through graphical data representations, that show properties and relationships from these data. This work presents an approach to overcome the visual scalability by using a Multi-projection system, allowing the exploration of large datasets. Additionally, this approach allows collaborative interaction and exploration by using mobile devices like tablets and smart phones.

Conferences, Coffee and Complexity: Supporting Cognition and Communication at Conventions
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2014
This article takes information visualization to the field of academic conferences and conventions, to explore how cognition and communication of participants could be supported in such ephemeral, knowledge-intensive environments. With focus on a non-invasive method of data collection, we consider the levels of topical, social, temporal and spatial orientation as primary working areas for any support system. Across these areas, overviews and personalized detail-views have to be intertwined, to allow for the localization and navigation of individual participants. To demonstrate a lean approach to these challenges, we introduce a visual conference exploration system, that allows participants to visually explore conferences before, during and after their attendance and support their personal knowledge management by making use of recommendations, which help to establish new contacts, or find the most interesting panels and talks.

A Heatmap-Based Time-Varying Multi-variate Data Visualization Unifying Numeric and Categorical Variables
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
Most time-varying data in our daily life is multi-variate. Moreover, most of such time-varying data contains both numeric and categorical values. It is often meaningful to visualize both of them as they are often correlated. We aim to visualize every value in such time-varying data in a single display space so that we can discover interesting relationships among the values of the time-varying data. This paper presents a heat map-based time-varying data visualization technique which displays both numeric and categorical values in a single display space. The technique assigns time to the horizontal axis of the display space, and vertically arranges the series of colored belts corresponding to the time-sequence values. It generates one belt for a numeric value, and multiple belts for a categorical value. It clusters the belts according to the similarity of color sequences, and re-arranges the belts based on the clustering result. This paper shows an example of the visualization result applying a time-varying multi-variate marketing dataset.

Heat Maps for Aggregating Bioacoustic Annotations

2014
In our large library of annotated environmental recordings of animal vocalizations, searching annotations by label can return thousands of results. We propose a heat map of aggregated annotation time and frequency bounds, maintaining the shape of the annotations as they appear on the spectrogram. This compactly displays the distribution of annotation bounds for the user's query, and allows them to easily identify unusual annotations. Key to this is allowing zero values on the map to be differentiated from areas where there are single annotations.

FacetScape: A Visualization for Exploring the Search Space

2014
Despite advancing search technologies, information overload has not yet been solved. Getting an overview of information or explorative access to information becomes increasingly difficult with the exponentially increasing amount of information. Search result visualizations, especially for faceted browsing, aim at supporting users to find their way through large document collections. We propose Facets cape, a novel visualization for navigation and refinement of search results allowing users to visually construct complex boolean search queries for narrowing down the search space. This visualization combines Voronoi subdivision and a tag cloud representation of the search facets. Further it includes a preview of action (query preview) and interactions to allow users to focus on important aspects of the data for the task at hand. In a comparative user study with 15 users we compared the visualization to a standard faceted browsing interface for different types of search tasks. The study revealed that participants used the unfamiliar interface as efficiently and effectively as the familiar tree-like display. Results indicate that the Facets cape is a promising way of supporting users in exploring the faceted search space.

Providing the educational community with tools to analyze educational processes may result in a more effective education. Applying Data Mining techniques to educational data results in information on educational settings which, however, comprehend an extensive set of symbolic patterns that are usually difficult to understand. Visualization, due to its potential to display large quantities of data, may overcome this limitation. We used the results of educational data mining techniques that had been applied to analyze the interdependence among courses in a university program and studied visualization mechanisms to enable the analysis of such patterns. We created a multi-level visualization, in which each level depicts a semester with corresponding courses. We have studied visual connectors to display a high number of interrelations between courses. User tests have shown the effectiveness of a connector which combines visual merging techniques with Bezier curves to represent course interrelation.

Word clouds are a popular means for summarizing text documents. They usually visualize the word frequencies from single text sources, sometimes along with other attributes. However, the visualization of several text documents in one word cloud has rarely been addressed so far. This paper presents Rad Cloud, a technique for text visualization based on multiple word clouds merged into a single view. Inspired by the Rad Viz approach, the words are radially arranged in an overlap-free layout. The text sources are indicated by the spatial word arrangement and stacked bar charts. The approach has been implemented in an interactive text visualization tool and its usefulness is illustrated by an example.

From Finger Gesture to Finger Choreography: Enabling 3D Live Performances on Smartphones
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
With the burgeoning availability of touchscreen mobile devices, display monitors and TVs, gestures manipulation on 2D has become a norm: a one or two-finger user interaction with text or 2D images as part of our daily activities. However, interaction with 3D objects and applications remains little explored. Apart from typing, map navigations, most of the 3D object gesture manipulation has been confined to three points of view for rotations, scaling and translations (RST). Currently, commonly seen applications are 3D video games where the user interacts with virtual game pads displayed on screen. 3D graphics interaction are still in its infancy, largely due to the limitation of the 3D surface constructs and the difficulty of interacting in 3D environments from 2D inputs. This paper offers a novel perspective on several classes of 3D structures devised by the author, whereby it enables a one or two-finger gestures to achieve as many degree of freedom (DoF) ad lib. Consequently, it empowers finger choreography on touchscreen of a one-handed handheld device such as a smartphone for 3D performances in real-time. And hence the constraint-free, easy-to-use, rich natural finger gesture manipulation enables extensive 3D object movements along any arbitrary axis at ease. As such, finger trajectories can be composed, synchronized with music to choreograph a live 3D performance. This paradigm shift approach presents a palette of personalized finger gestures and the results of the finger choreography on several classes of equation-based 3D objects. On mobile devices.

Flip Visualization for Web Based Demographic Simulation System
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
We propose "flip visualization" system which quickly changes a shown image from many images and allows users to find difference of images easily by the effect of the persistence of vision. In the system users can manipulate "flip animation" interactively, such as flip forward or backward, increase or decrease flipping speed, and stop flipping. The system can also divide images into clusters by manual operation of users, if they found a difference of images. In order to check the effect of flip visualization, we develop a web-based demographic simulation system for archaeology which simulates ancient society. It generates images as results, and shows them by flip visualization.

2014
Novices and beginners have multiple motivations to learn how to program. The greatest hurdle for them to overcome is the intimidation of the code itself. Making the code easier to understand and operate on assists them in the task of learning to program. This paper reports on a novel HTML games editor interface for assisting novice and beginner programmers to create games for mobile devices. Visualising the results of their programming in the form of a game helped them overcome their initial anxiety. The HTML games editor was developed using a cycled evaluation study to best meet the novice and beginner users' needs. The goal for novices and beginners to create a game suitable for playing on a mobile device in 1.5 hours was achieved.

Effects of Visualizing Missing Data: An Empirical Evaluation
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
This paper presents an empirical study that evaluates the effects of visualizing missing data on decision-making tasks. A comparison between three visualization techniques: (1) emptiness, (2) fuzziness, and (3) emptiness plus explanation, revealed that the latter technique induced significantly higher degree of decision-confidence than the visualization technique fuzziness. Moreover, emptiness plus explanation yield the highest number of risky choices of the three. This result suggests that uncertainty visualization techniques affect the decision-maker and the decisionconfidence. Additionally, the results indicate a possible relation between the degree of decision-confidence and the decision-maker's displayed risk behavior.

Coordinated Multiple Views to Support Image Retrieval
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
The number of images available has grown over the years, as well as the number of techniques to aid to organizing and retrieving from image collections. Techniques and systems have been proposed to recover images based on query, in which an image (or words) is used as input parameter and a list of similar images (or images with related text content) is recovered. However, understanding how the retrieved images are related to each other remains as a problem. This paper proposes an approach based on multidimensional visualization and coordination techniques to show the relationship from retrieved images. In this approach, coordination techniques are employed to perform image retrieval methods and highlight the results in visual representations, showing how retrieved images are relate. To evaluate our proposal image collections with and without textual annotations related to each image were used, and also image retrieval mechanisms based on distance, topic and semantic to retrieve images from distinct and multimodal datasets.

Multimedia annotation algorithms infer localized metadata in multimedia content, e.g. Speakers' voices or subjects' faces. There is a growing need of experts from this domain to perform advanced analyses, that go beyond medium-scale quality metrics. This paper describes a novel visual tool, that addresses the concerns of multimedia experts using interactive visualization principles. Multiple coordinated views, augmented by interactive inspection facilities, ease both the navigation in media annotations and the visual detection of relevant information. The usefulness of our approach is supported by experimental scenarios using a real multimedia corpus.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for the comparison and matching of documents written in different languages. Our approach is devoted to situations where documents can be conceptually represented by abstract graphs. Our approach builds on previous work yet it addresses some limitations left open by previous work. The benefits of our approach is twofold. First, our approach makes it possible to compare original multi-lingual documents without requiring a translation in a pivot language contrary to other approaches. Second, we propose a highly visual and interactive environment so that human experts can perform both comparison of documents and lexical matching in a seamless way contrary to other approaches where matching and comparison are often considered separately.

Animated Geo-temporal Clusters for Exploratory Search in Event Data Document Collections
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
This paper presents a novel visual analytics technique developed to support exploratory search tasks for event data document collections. The technique supports discovery and exploration by clustering results and overlaying cluster summaries onto coordinated timeline and map views. Users can also explore and interact with search results by selecting clusters to filter and re-cluster the data with animation used to smooth the transition between views. The technique demonstrates a number of advantages over alternative methods for displaying and exploring geo-referenced search results and spatio-temporal data. Firstly, cluster summaries can be presented in a manner that makes them easy to read and scan. Listing representative events from each cluster also helps the process of discovery by preserving the diversity of results. Also, clicking on visual representations of geo-temporal clusters provides a quick and intuitive way to navigate across space and time simultaneously. This removes the need to overload users with the display of too many event labels at any one time. The technique was evaluated with a group of nineteen users and compared with an equivalent text based exploratory search engine.

A Visual Analytics of Geometric Distances between Amino Acids and Surface Pockets of Proteins
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2014
Protein is the major component of the organism. It has a unique three-dimensional structure determined by its amino acid sequence. A concave (pocket) on the surface of a protein is known to be the best target for a drug to react. We started analyzing how" drug ability" of proteins related to the location of amino acids in a pocket. For as tarter of the study, this paper presents a visualization tool for distance analysis between pockets and the amino acid residue. Provided that a protein surface is described by a triangular mesh, this tool first identifies pockets on the protein surface, specifies the deepest point and outer loops of the pocket, and calculates distances between atoms of an amino acid residue and the deepest point or the outer loops of the pocket. The tool then visualizes the statistics of the distance calculation results by poly line charts and the distribution by scatter plots. This paper proposes a biological interpretation of the visualization results.

From Multiple Linked Views to Multiple Linked Analyses: The Meme Media Digital Dashboard

We describe a system called the Digital Dashboard that uses multiple linked views of data. All views allow interaction with the visualization results and interaction is done through direct manipulation. The system has been extended to allow new complex data to be generated in analysis components at runtime, e.g. By statistical analysis or data mining of parts of the data. The resulting data can be used in other linked views or analysis components, so when e.g. A data mining parameter is changed, all linked views (or analysis components) are automatically updated as soon as the new calculations are finished, and when something changes in linked components (e.g. A different subset of the data is selected), the calculations are automatically redone (if necessary).

This paper presents an original approach for supporting the use of geovisual analytics solutions. Many models have been proposed to characterize information visualization methods, but few have been integrated to an intelligent process for supporting user in geo-information usage. Moreover, several new solutions are continuously proposed by research, but few of them are really used in operational world. For instance, the maritime surveillance systems could gain much more identification capabilities of ship behaviors with adequate geovisual analytics solutions. Therefore, we investigated the use of geovisual methods for the analysis of mobility data, such as ship trajectories. We propose a knowledge-based system using ontologies and rules. These allow modeling the domain of geovisual analytics solutions, and their capacities in the exploration and the analysis of trajectories. This system would be used to support users in geovisual analytics of movement, based on their context of use.

In visual analytics, data comparison is a means of analyzing data. We developed Parallel Box to support the visual analysis of multivariate data by facilitating the flexible comparison of numerous multivariate items. To compare the data distributions of multivariate data, we combine cumulative bar charts and box plots, tools that are widely used in statistics. Using shadow expression based on the visual Gestalt principles of grouping, Parallel Box enables a direct comparison between either datasets or variables. We performed a social media analysis as a case study of Parallel Box. The results of our analysis confirm that Parallel Box is useful for visual analysis.

In this paper we study a 3D tubular visualization of software activity log data, with the aim of supporting multithreaded software development and debugging. We consider an existing visualization called Datatube2 that has already been used to help various domain experts in the analysis of large amounts of time-dependent data. Since software logs are also time series, DataTube2 has been enhanced to support the specific data and tasks that are currently found in debugging, yielding to a specific visualization that we called DataTube4log. In this visualization, each line in the tube is devoted to the activity of a thread. Dependencies between threads are materialized with arrows. Synchronization objects are also represented. Using a real dataset, we show how a domain expert has solved a debugging problem. In this experiment, we found that DataTube4log can be easily learned and adopted, and that the ability of the tube to efficiently render an overview of large time series was beneficial to the software engineer.

Directional Aggregate Visualization of Large Scale Movement Data

Widespread use of GPS terminals has made it possible to collect geospatial movement data, and visualization is an effective method to understand such data. However, for large scale movement analysis, because the data set includes complex movements of individuals, it is difficult to understand using naive visualization methods. In order to solve this problem, we developed a visualization technique that can represent large scale movement data in an aggregate manner. This visualization technique has two representations: "amoeba representation" and "amoeba colony representation." Amoeba representation represents the distance moved from a point in any direction with map scale in a geographical space, and amoeba colony representation represents movements over a wide geographical space.

Towards the Identification of Consumer Trajectories in Geo-Located Search Data
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2014
Modern geo-positioning system (GPS) enabled smart phones are generating an increasing volume of information about their users, including geo-located search, movement, and transaction data. While this kind of data is increasingly rich and offers many grand opportunities to identify patterns and predict behaviour of groups and individuals, it is not immediately obvious how to develop a framework for extracting plausible inferences from these data. In our case, we have access to a large volume of real user data from the Point smart phone application, and we have developed a generic and layered system architecture to incrementally find aggregate items of interest within that data. This includes time and space correlations, e.g., are people searching for dinner and a movie, distributions of usage patterns and platforms, e.g., geographic distribution of Android, Apple, and BlackBerry users, and clustering to identify relatively complex search and movement patterns we call "consumer trajectories." Our pursuit of these kinds of patterns has helped guide our development of information extraction, machine learning, and visualization methods that provide systematic tools for investigating the geo-located data, and for the development of both conceptual tools and visualization tools in aid of finding both interesting and useful patterns in that data. Included in our system architecture is the ability to consider the difference between exploratory and explanatory hypotheses on data patterns, as well as the deployment of multiple visualization methods that can provide alternatives to help expose interesting patterns. In our introduction to our framework here, we provide examples of formulating hypotheses on geo-located behaviour, and how a variety of methods including those from machine learning and visualization, can help confirm or deny the value of such hypotheses as they emerge. In this particular case, we provide an initial basis for identifying semantically motivated data artifacts we call geo-located consumer trajectories. We investigate their plausibility with a variety of time and space series clustering and visualization models.

SchemaLine: Timeline Visualization for Sensemaking

Timeline visualization is an important tool for sense making. It allows analysts to examine information in chronological order and to identify temporal patterns and relationships. However, many existing timeline visualization methods are not designed for the dynamic and iterative nature of the sense making process and the various analysis activities it involves. In this paper, we introduce a novel timeline visualization, Schema Line, to address these deficiencies. Schema Line is designed to group notes into analyst-determined schema, using a layout algorithm to produce compact but aesthetically pleasing timeline visualization, and includes fluid user interactions to support sense making activities. It enables interactive temporal schemata construction with seamless integration with visual data exploration and note taking. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the participants found the new method easy to learn and use, and its features effective for the sense making activities for which it was designed.

Semantic Blossom Graph: A New Approach for Visual Graph Exploration
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
Graphs are widely used to represent relationships between entities. Indeed, their simplicity in depicting connectedness backed by a mathematical formalism, make graphs an ideal metaphor to convey relatedness between entities irrespective of the domain. However, graphs pose several challenges for visual analysis. A large number of entities or a densely connected set quickly render the graph unreadable due to clutter. Typed relationships leading to multigraphs cannot clearly be represented in hierarchical layout or edge bundling, common clutter reduction techniques. We propose a novel approach to visual analysis of complex graphs based on two metaphors: semantic blossom and selective expansion. Instead of showing the whole graph, we display only a small representative subset of nodes, each with a compressed summary of relations in a semantic blossom. Users apply selective expansion to traverse the graph and discover the subset of interest. A preliminary evaluation showed that our approach is intuitive and useful for graph exploration and provided insightful ideas for future improvements.

HistoGraph -- A Visualization Tool for Collaborative Analysis of Networks from Historical Social Multimedia Collections
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
This paper describes the design and development of histoGraph, an interactive tool for explorative visualization and collaborative investigation of historical social networks from multimedia collections. Developed in an interdisciplinary collaboration of computer scientists, historians, HCI researchers and interface designers, the tool aims at supporting historians in the discovery and historical analysis of relationships between people, places and events. A special focus is on the identification and interactive visualization of social relations from historical photo collections through a combination of automatic analysis and expert-based crowd sourcing. The tool design bridges the gap between established network analysis and visualization techniques and traditional hermeneutic research methods in historical research. It integrates visual exploration with hybrid social graph construction, hypothesis formulation and the consultation of digitized primary sources. A formative evaluation of the current prototype, developed as a domain-specific application for historians in the field of European integration points to opportunities and critical factors in applying this approach to support and further current research practices in digital humanities.

Visualizing the History of Knowledge Production through the Bibliography of Philosophy
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
This paper examines prospects for visualizing historical bibliography, which studies the history of books and the people, institutions, and machines surrounding them. These studies have potential for revealing not only the history of knowledge production, but also for examining the evolving structures used to organize, catalog, and conceptualize that knowledge. This paper presents a case study in history of philosophy using data from the largest bibliography in the field, which was parsed to extract structured information about each work and its subject heading. Such data reveal (1) the emergence of particular topics across time and space, (2) transmission of ideas as measured through publication location and version information, and (3) the topical shifts in the field over time as reflected by subject classification of texts. Together, these statistical, geospatial, and network visualizations explore the potential of historical bibliography within the digital humanities.

2014
Training and visualizing operational culture is important since understanding culture is a significant aspect of mission planning and execution. Serious games and 3D simulations provide efficient training and battlefield visualization in a safe and relatively inexpensive immersive environment. The research presented in this paper was initiated by the CAMO project (Cultural Awareness in Military Operations). The goal of the project was to create a low-cost simulation in the 3D virtual world of Second Life for pre-deployment cultural awareness training among Norwegian military personnel preparing for service in Afghanistan. In this paper, we focus on the role of crowd simulations and virtual humans for visualizing Afghan culture for training purposes, also in a civilian context.

Visualising the Correlation between Vasari's Accounts of Giotto's Travels and Contemporary Research to Better Understand their Reliability
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
Giorgio Vasari (1511 - 1574) was perhaps the first art-historian to earnestly record the life and times of the great artists of the Italian Renaissance. Of the many he recorded, Giotto di Bond one (1267 - 1337) is heralded as the 'father' of the Renaissance perspective style. However, contemporary research suggests much of Vasari's accounts of Giotto's life and travels are fictional. This paper attempts to explore how reliable Vasari's accounts are by correlating his chronological narrative of Giotto's life with contemporary research and Giotto's chronicled works. Using interactive integrated timeline and mapping visualisation tools it was possible to identify greater accuracy in Vasari's accounts than that suggested by the literature.

Web3D Visualization of High Detail and Complex 3D-mesh Caves Models
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
This paper presents the novel architecture of a web3D server that stores 3D models with different levels of detail and complexity that enables the interactive visualization and navigation in a web browser and the determination of detailed geomorphological structures of an underground cave. We surveyed an underground cave using a Terrestrial Laser Scanning to acquire a high-level detail point cloud with millions of points. This data allowed generating a high detail 3D-mesh to represent the surface model of the cave chamber, which can be important in studying geomorphological features. The web3D server uses a simplified version of the cave with about 250 thousand triangles that enables client applications to navigate and interact with this simplified model in a Web browser. The more detailed and complex model of the cave with millions of triangles is also stored in the web3D server. This model is used for the identification of geomorphological structures. It provides topological and geometrical information that is implemented in an octree data structure for the design of efficient algorithms to determine important speleothems and stored in a database to make it possible to work with big data models that can exceed the computer's memory.

None
2014
This paper explores drawing as a design medium for conceptualising ideas within the built environment professionals and its application through computer mediated environments and tangible interfaces in particular. Developments in human-computer interactions' technologies allow the integration of physical and digital realms. Furthermore, advances in multi-touch displays promote the hap tic experience, which is substantial for externalising and communicating visual ideas among designers. As a result, an interactive surface is tested in two different studies with a multidisciplinary group of built environment professionals. The aim of the paper is to compare two different design applications, a commercial available one and a tailor-made one, to further analyse the effect of such an environment on the participants' perceptual, conceptual and collaborative actions and, eventually, to propose further research on augmented design platforms.

Medical Image Segmentation Using Particle Swarm Optimization
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2014
Segmentation of medical images is one of the fundamental problems in image processing field. It aims to provide a crucial decision support to physicians. There are several methods to perform segmentation. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) constitutes an elegant way to model the problem of segmentation. This modelling leads to the minimization of an energy function. In this paper we focus on Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO) method to solve this optimization problem. The quality of segmentation is evaluated on grounds truths images using the Kappa index. The results show the supremacy of the HMRF-PSO method compared to K-means and threshold based techniques.

Object designing has a significance importance in the field of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM). In this paper, two techniques for the designing of 2D objects are developer. These are based on rational cubic spline interpolant and rational quadratic spline interpolant with shape parameters controlling the shape of the curve in the description of rational functions. It is shown that a piece of curve designed using rational cubic spline interpolant can be presented by two segments of rational quadratic spline interpolant. The developed schemes are simple, local and computationally inexpensive.

Inpainting by an Inverse Problem Resolution
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
The in painting is a fundamental process in the image processing, which has several applications, such as image restoration, reconstructing damaged parts, the removal of unwanted objects in the image etc. The goal is to produce a revised image where treated parts are perfectly fused in it. In this paper we propose an approach which involves the direct solution of a system of Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible Newtonian fluid. The main idea is to consider the image intensity as a function of the stream flow. The resolution algorithm automatically transports the information correction to the damaged part of the image, a process which can simultaneously reconstruct several damaged regions by solving an inverse problem, without requiring the user to specify a location treatment. The mathematical analysis of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is sufficiently developed, see for example R. Temam (1977), so we try to draw analogies between these equations and in painting which may introduce ideas of fluid mechanics and dynamics in problems of image processing.

iSyn: WebGL-Based Interactive De Novo Drug Design
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
We present iSyn, a WebGL-based tool for interactivede novo drug design. It features an evolutionary algorithm that automatically designs novel ligands with drug-like properties and synthetic feasibility using click chemistry. Isyn interfaces with our popular and fast molecular docking engine idock, remarkably reducing the evaluation and ranking time of drug candidates. Furthermore, inspired by our user friendly and high-performance WebGL visualizer iview, our iSyn also implements a tailor-made interactive visualizer to aid novel drug design. We believe iSyn can supplement the efforts of medicinal chemists in drug discovery research. To illustrate the utility of iSyn in generating novelligands ex nihilo, we designed predicted inhibitors of two important drug targets, which are RNA editing ligase 1(REL1) from T. Brucei, the etiological agent of African sleeping sickness, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), a positive regulator of eukaryotic cell cycle progression. Results show that iSyn managed to significantly enhance the predicted binding affinity of the best generated ligand by more than 3 orders of magnitude in potency. Isyn is written in C++, Python, HTML5 and JavaScript. It is free and open source, available athttp://istar.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/iSyn.tgz. It has been tested successfully on both Linux and Windows.

2014
This paper presents a visualization approach to accessing and exploring the knowledge obtained from patient cases created by general practitioners in their medical practice during postgraduate practical training. Our application MediMatrix visualizes this knowledge base by displaying the patient cases in a matrix-based grid. It addresses domain specific challenges (broad spectrum of medical topics, isolation from peers during training, time pressure) and use cases (solving patient cases, learning for the exam) of the target group. In addressing these requirements MediMatrix focuses on supporting specific kinds of information tasks such as gaining a quick overview of a heterogeneous case collection, comparing a specific case with other cases and discovering topical cross-connections between cases. Through the provided visual modalities for explorative access of a learner-generated medical case collection physicians can easily discover patient cases relevant for their practice and share knowledge by discussing, working on and learning from the patient cases.

Visual Analysis with Dynamic Geometric Complementarity and Physicochemical Matching in Protein Docking
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
Prediction of the 3D structure of protein-protein complexes is crucial for understanding the biological system of life and thus for designing drugs. However it is a challenging problem due to the flexibility of the backbone and side-chains of the receptor and ligand. In this paper, we present a new framework for fast and flexible protein-protein docking based on geometric and physicochemical complementarity. In our approach, we segment the protein surfaces into several local surface patches and describe the effect of side-chain flexibility on each patch by sampling the space of conformation of its side-chains. Then the geometric complementarity can be determined by matching these surface patches. During the matching, we propose a new 3D shape descriptor, Spherical Harmonics Descriptor. The main property of the Spherical Harmonics Descriptor is rotation invariance which avoids taking an exhaustive set of rotations for each pair of patches. Thus, the geometric complementarity matching problem is simplified to a histogram matching problem. This can greatly reduce the computational cost. Finally, the docking candidates are evaluated by a scoring function which can accommodate geometric complementarity and physicochemical matching. The experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

Regional Differences in Diagnostic Conversion to Dementia

The worldwide increase in dementia incidence has important health and environmental implications for both patients and caregivers. The ability to predict who will develop dementia and to identify risk factors of rapid progression would be a major advance in preventative healthcare. Few studies have surveyed the impact of environmental differences in combination with clinical and genetic factors in modifying dementia progression. We examined variation in diagnostic conversion from normal cognition to dementia in a multi-site cohort of study volunteers. Center-to-Center differences, residence in sparsely populated regions, lower education, older age and more severe cognitive impairment at study entry were associated with conversion to dementia within 5 years following the baseline visit. Because of strong individual Center effects, for which the underlying determinants were not identified, studying diagnostic conversion on a Center-by-Center basis may reveal viable genetic and environmental influences.

Interactive Biosignal Analysis and Classification

We often encounter experimental results that are difficult to quantify although the visual recognition of a phenomenon is apparent. We are able to detect patterns and features with our vision that are complex to specify algorithmically. This is because our brain has evolved into a powerful pattern matching machine. One important class of measurement results in medical research are signals that describe a cycling pattern of some phenomenon. In this work, we developed a software tool, Anomaly Explorer, to assist in classification of Ca2+ signals emitted by cardiomyocytes. Anomaly Explorer was designed and implemented to analyze and classify Ca2+ signals with criteria similar to the criteria used by laboratory personnel. The software tool is based on interactive visualization with a direct manipulation user interface. Our Anomaly Explorer has proven to be a valuable tool as it makes the analysis faster, more accurate, and person-independent. The definition of signal anomalies in terms of visual properties is more flexible than numerical or analytical specification. Our approach is not limited to the Ca2+ signal analysis. The anomaly types are domain-specific, but the interaction and visualization ideas can be applied in any signal analysis problem.

Illustration-Inspired Visualization of Blood Flow Dynamics

Image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a central tool in the evaluation of hemodynamic factors in cardiovascular disease development and treatment, to the point where major vendors are now seeking to deploy CFD solvers on their medical imaging platforms. Detailed hemodynamic data available from CFD generate large data sets due to complex flow, which are difficult to render clearly - and thus communicate to clinical stakeholders - using conventional engineering flow visualization techniques. This is especially challenging considering the four-dimensional nature of the flow patterns (i.e., Rapidly varying in space and time), as well as the clinical need for generating static reports rather than cumbersome digital animations. Taking a cue from the rich history of biomedical illustration, our goal is to use this opportunity for developing new data-driven paradigms for visualizing blood flow based on the principles of illustration, sequential art, and the visual vocabularies and conventions of radiology and vascular surgery.

Computer-Assisted Myocardial Perfusion Assessment

Left ventricle functional analysis can be performed using coronary CT angiography (CTA) images. In recent years it has been proposed that CTA imaging might also be used for myocardial perfusion assessment, by visually looking for hypoattenuated regions that may correspond to hypoperfusion. Assigning a detected lesion to a specific myocardial segment requires significant effort while the clinician matches the American Heart Association (AHA) standard myocardial segments to the anatomy of each patient. This article presents an interactive tool which, based on the existence of a previous left ventricle segmentation, automatically matches the lesions detected by the clinician to a myocardial segment and provides feedback over the image regarding the myocardial segments with detected lesions and their severity.

In-vitro Validation of Image Guided Surgery System with 3D Pre-Operative Visualization for Atrial Transseptal Puncture
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2014
The left atrium (LA) is the most difficult cardiac chamber to access percutaneously. The route through the systemic venous system across the interatrial septum is mostly preferred to the more retrograde arterial route as larger catheters and devices could be manipulated safely. The transseptal (TS) puncture permits this direct route to the LA through the interatrial septum which is necessary in patients with a trial fibrillation (cardiac ablation), patent fossa ovalis (PFO), a trial septal defect (ASD) repair, left atrium appendage closure, balloon mitral valvuoloplasty, pulmonary vein stenos is intervention, Ante grade ventricular septal defect closure, stent implantation in the right internal carotid artery. For a safe TS puncture, one requires a delivery system and medical imaging software. At present doctors use biplanar fluoroscopic images during navigation and TS puncture. The two-dimensional echocardiography aids the doctor during the TS puncture. A complete three-dimensional visualization is yet to be established. We propose an efficient method for target localization pre-operatively and three-dimensional visualization with respect to catheter tip of the scene during the procedure. This technique eliminates fluoroscopy. The technique proposed in this work has been validated in-vitro using an a trial phantom, used to train doctors in electrophysiology (EP) labs. The pre-operative image obtained using MRI is registered with the phantom and the catheter tip location inside the phantom and is visualized in three-dimensions.

Visualization of Spiral Drawing Data of Patients with Parkinson's Disease

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) need to be frequently monitored in order to assess their individual symptoms and treatment-related complications. Advances in technology have introduced telemedicine for patients in remote locations. However, data produced in such settings lack much information and are not easy to analyze or interpret compared to traditional, direct contact between the patient and clinician. Therefore, there is a need to present the data using visualization techniques in order to communicate in an understandable and objective manner to the clinician. This paper presents interaction and visualization approaches used to aid clinicians in the analysis of repeated measures of spirography of PD patients gathered by means of a telemetry touch screen device. The proposed approach enables clinicians to observe fine motor impairments and identify motor fluctuations of their patients while they perform the tests from their homes using the telemetry device.

2014
Multi-objective optimization tools have been applied in various academic and industry fields. It is often difficult to optimize all the objectives since they often cause trade-offs. It is also difficult to figure what kinds of trade-offs actually cause. We think visualization of multi-objective optimization results assists users to intuitively understand the distributions of their solutions. This paper proposes a visualization of explanatory variable and objective function spaces in the separate views, so that users can easily understand their relevancy. Also, our tool features the linkage mechanism between the two views. When a user selects certain ranges of the values by a mouse click operation, the tool highlights all the corresponding individuals. This mechanism is useful for users to narrow down the results. We expect the tool assists the understanding of the behavior of the optimization processes and improvement of the future processes.

Super-Resolution Using Edge Modification through Stationary Wavelet Transform

2014
In this paper, a super-resolution technique is proposed that uses a combination of bicubic interpolation and wavelet transform. Bicubic interpolation produces a high resolution image but is prone to blurring artifact. So the blurring artifact is reduced in the wavelet domain. The input low-resolution is up-sampled using bicubic interpolation. The edges of the resultant high-resolution image are enhanced using stationary wavelet transform (SWT). SWT is applied to the image to produce sub-bands of the image and then these sub-bands are modified by multiplying with a boost value. Then these sub-bands are combined using inverse stationary wavelet transform (ISWT) to produce the final high-resolution image. The quantitative and qualitative analysis illustrate that the proposed technique is provides superior results as compared to other existing techniques.

Thanks to recent evolution of portable music players featuring large storage spaces, we tend to carry large number of tunes. It often makes us more bothering to look for tunes which we want to listen to. On the one hand, we usually listen to the tunes on the music players by manually selecting playlists or album names, rather than manually selecting each tune one-by-one. This paper presents GRAPE, a playlist visualization technique being used as user interfaces on the music players. GRAPE presents a set of tunes as a gradation image, by assigning colors to the tunes based on their musical features, and placing them onto a display space by applying Self Organizing Map (SOM). This paper describes the processing flow of GRAPE, and introduces user evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAPE.

There is an increasing number of students using tablets in schools. Mobile devices gained popularity as an educational tool and there are many schools that use them frequently in educational activities to improve learning. We found that first year students of mechanical engineering in general have difficulties in understanding 3D shapes from 2D views. There are many Augmented Reality (AR) applications available that can be used to create educational contents for these mobile devices. On the other hand, there is an increasing interest in making holograms. In this paper we studied the most popular AR systems and show examples of using an AR system for the visualization of 3D models. We also present the creation of a low cost prototype, the EducHolo, that enables the visualization of holograms supported by tablets. With this prototype students can visualize the hologram of mechanical parts, providing a better perception of the model 3D shape and improving the ability of making the 2D orthographic views and perspectives that they study in the first year of mechanical engineer.

A reference pixel that is part of the desirable text area is given by user since this is the easiest way to give the priors. In text detection, first, foreground pixels are extracted. Then, the text components and its structure are analyzed, constructing a graph with the text components. The image rectification is executed based on quadrangle estimation.

A Tool for Visually Exploring Multi-objective Mixed-Integer Optimization Models
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
Multi-objective optimization models have been increasingly used as optimal decisions are searched in settings considering several conflicting objectives. In these cases compromises must be made and often a large number of non-dominated optimal solutions exist. From these solutions decision-makers must find the preferred one. This is a difficult task both from a computational and cognitive point of views, as it requires several solutions to be obtained and compared. An interactive visualization tool for fully understanding the best trade-offs is therefore becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes visualization solutions, implemented in a tool, for aiding decision-makers in finding the preferred solution in multi-objective optimization problems.

Variations of "Human Computer Interaction" Syllabus in Computer Science Area
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2014
In theory, course curriculum, also known as course syllabus, should play an important role in the success of learning. However, in practice course syllabus are often far from playing this role. In this paper, we analyze several course syllabus in order to better characterize learning expectations in the field of HCI (Human Computer Interaction) and Computer Science. We start by analyzing variations of course syllabus descriptions in that field. We report the results of a case study using simple statistics to automatically extract relationships from syllabus documents of HCI courses described online. We further provide some requirements for future syllabus descriptions that seem to be missing in all the syllabus descriptions analyzed. Our aim with this work is to urge further discussions and future work to enhance the content and practice related to course syllabus.

On the Analysis of Wikipedia Activity through Time

2014
Wikipedia articles see bursts of update activity whenever a topic is of more interest to the community or has somehow become controversial. Analyzing when and what changes are made can, thus, give us an idea of how the community feels about particular subjects. In this paper we present Pop Culture, a system that provides a visualization of Wikipedia's edits that allows us to reflect on how different subjects are perceived by people over time and, by comparing articles from different language wikipedias, find regional and cultural differences of interest and perception. A set of user studies shows that, indeed, users are able to use Pop Culture effectively and efficiently to find such trends and differences.

Detecting Mango Fruits by Using Randomized Hough Transform and Backpropagation Neural Network
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
A new method for mango detection is presented in this paper. This method is based on preprocessing operators on image which includes converting to gray image, finding edges, calculating distances to edges, opening morphology and converting to binary color image. To take advantage of oval shaped mango fruit, we apply Randomized Hough Transform method to detect potential places for mango fruit in input images. By using Back propagation Neural Network, we recognize mango fruits from these potential places. The dataset used to implementing this paper is 50 RGB images captured of mango fruits on trees. As shown in experimental results, in the case of clear fruit in input images, the detection rates up to 96.26% while it decreases in the case of partially covering or overlapping. However, this method can be applied to detect other fruits in varied sizes and colors.

This article discusses a possible approach combining existing technologies for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) and Data Visualization in a coherent Decision Support System (DSS) aimed to formulate and verify specific interpretative hypotheses about a certain text. The approach chosen for developing this system implies (i.) the customization and integration of existing tools for automatic text annotation (first of all, linguistic, lexicographic and semantic) and (ii.) the construction of a user-friendly and highly expressive GUI. The interface is conceived to allow users to (i.) upload the text/s they are studying, (ii) run the desired annotation tools, and (iii.) visually interact with the resulting multi-layered network to explore the network, proof-read the results of the automatic annotations and add missing elements and/or relations between elements.

Design process often reflects the personality of designer that might fall into certain patterns. In general, the process can be divided into brief, case retrieval, design decision-making, operation, and outcome. Thus, sketch often clues to design information. Generate a large of prescriptive sketch that is important information in this study. In order to get the quick feedback and generate massive data (sketches) for E-V-Analysis, graphic design is chosen as the design domain. Through EVA, we found some rules and make the system automatically generated visualization results through chapter 5 of 3 visualization rules. Therefore, in design, designers could understand the change process of the sketch, and understand the creative in design process. Assist designers in the design, we could find the new idea through pass design, let designer's holds that thinking and idea.

Visualising Emotional Landmarks in Cities
2014 18th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2014
Different people and cultures associate different emotional states to different parts and spaces of cities. These vary according to individuals, their cultures and also to the time of day, day of week, season, special occasions and more. Recurring patterns may occur in correspondence of the places in which people work, study, entertain themselves, consume, relate, wait or just take a break. What can we learn from these patterns? Trying to find possible answers to this question passes through the possibility to visualize and represent the configurations of emotional expressions in urban spaces, across time, geography, theme, cultures and other dimensions. We have developed ways in which it is possible to harvest people's geo-located (or geo-locatable) emotional expressions from major social networks and to visualize them according to a variety of different modalities. In this paper we will present a series of these types of visualizations, and the ways in which they can be used to gain better understandings of these emotional patterns as they arise, from points of view which derive from anthropology, urbanism, sociology, politics and also arts and poetics. The paper will focus on the ways in which the data is harvested from different social networks, then categorized and annotated with meta-data describing the emotional states, the languages in which people express themselves, the geographic locations, the themes expressed. A methodology for representing this information across a variety of domains (time, space, emotion, theme) will then be presented in detail. A reflection on possible usage cases for anthropology, urbanism, policy-making, arts and design will end the contribution, as well as the description of series of open issues and the indication of possible nextsteps for research.

2015
The role of a texture's directionality (i.e., Orientedness) in multivariate visualization is explored. A key emphasis here is determining if directional textures can be an effective component in the visualization of multiple attribute data, in particular weather data. Toward that end, a new directional texture-based data visualization technique is described and exhibited. Results of user-based evaluations of directional textures in visualization are also reported.

Designing and Annotating Metro Maps with Loop Lines
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
Schematic metro maps provide an effective means of simplifying the geographical configuration of public rapid transportation systems. Nonetheless, travelers still find it difficult to identify routes of a specific topology on the maps because it is usually hidden behind the conventional octilinear layout of the entire map. In this paper, we present an approach to designing schematic maps with loop lines, which are drawn as circles together with annotation labels for guiding different traveling purposes. Our idea here is to formulate the aesthetic criteria as mathematical constraints in the mixed-integer programming model, which allows us to either align stations on the loop line at a grid if they are interchange stations or noninterchange stations on a circle otherwise. We then distribute the annotation labels associated with stations on the loop line evenly to the four side boundary of the map domain in order to make full use of the annotation space, while maximally avoiding intersections between leader lines and the metro network by employing a flow network algorithm. Finally, we present several experimental results generated by our prototype system to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

A Visualization Tool for Building Energy Management System

2015
Many public offices and companies manage their energy consumption by Building Energy Management System (BEMS). It is not an easy task to determine whether the past energy consumption was really necessary or just wasted. Visualization for energy consumption is useful to understand the situations of energy consumption to determine their necessity. This paper presents a visualization tool for energy consumption with BEMS. The tool firstly divides the daily variation of the energy usage and environmental measurements (e.g. Temperature and humidity) into the meaningful number of patterns. It displays "long-term polyline chart" to represent the frequency of the daily pattern so that users can easily focus on particular dates at particular places. It also displays " one-day polyline chart" to represent the daily variation of the recorded values of the particular dates and places specified by users' click operations. The paper introduces the examples of visualization to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented tool, with a real dataset of business office building.

Visual Analysis of Source Code Similarities

None
2015
Software systems typically consist of many lines of source code organized in several files hierarchically structured into directories and packages. Since the code is the key data in software development, in many scenarios an overview of it is required, in particular for similar code passages. In this paper, we investigate the visual analysis of source code similarities for local as well as global code passages. To this end, we first compute all subsequence occurrence frequencies (support metric) and relative occurrence frequencies (confidence metric) in local as well as global code regions. The resulting textual data attached by its occurrence values is displayed in a triangular matrix. Several interaction techniques are integrated in our visualization tool which are illustrated in the corresponding case study illustrating similarities in source code written in Assembler consisting of 10,641 characters.

Visualization Support for Comparing Energy Consumption Data

Providing effective feedback can empower users to change their behaviour and take the necessary actions to reduce their energy consumption. The types of feedback that allow comparison of energy usage seem to be particularly valuable. This paper introduces the time-stack visualization, which has been designed to support comparisons of individual and collective energy usage data. It also describes a user study conducted to compare the effectiveness of time-stack against a similar visualization called time-pie. The results show that although the two visualizations are generally comparable in their effectiveness, users rate time-stack more favourably.

Indexed Dataflow Network: A Multi-layer and Programmable Architecture to Integrate Both Visualization Pipelines and Scene Graphs
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
Visualization pipelines and scene graphs are widely used paradigms in rendering applications, the former as a key concept in scientific visualization while the latter provides a powerful representation for 3D scenes in graphics applications. Despite an apparent disparity in usage, they show structural similarities by both using a graph-based architecture. Nevertheless, few attempts have been made to integrate both visualization pipelines and scene graphs in a unified design. This paper presents an architecture based on an extended dataflow network which allows implicit invocation of callbacks on network events. Events are then handled by programmable layers on top of the "dataflow layer" to dynamically build scene graph structures and define a multiparadigm model interface, which forms what we call an "indexed dataflow network". We show an implementation of our architecture using NVIDIA SceniX scene management engine and Qt's model/view framework.

Visualizing the Evolution of Module Workflows

2015
Module workflows are used to generate custom applications with modular software frameworks. They describe data flow between the modular components and their execution under certain parameter configurations. In many cases, module workflows are modeled in a graphical way by the user. To come up with the final result or to explore multiple solutions, they often undergo many iterations of adaptation. Furthermore, existing workflows may be reused for new applications. We visualize the evolution of module workflows with a focus-and-context approach and visualization techniques for time-dependent data. Our approach provides insight into user behavior and the characteristics of the underlying systems. As our examples show, this can help identify usability issues and indicate options to improve the effectiveness of the system. We demonstrate our approach for module workflows in Vis Trails, a modular visualization system that allows building custom visualizations by combining different modules for processing and visualizing data.

A Color-Based Visualization Approach to Understand Harmonic Structures of Musical Compositions
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
Music expertise is the ability to understand the structural elements of music compositions by reading musical scores or even by simply listening to music performance. Although the most common way to learn music is through the study of musical scores, this approach is demanding in terms of learning ability, given the required implicit knowledge of music theoretical notations and concepts. In this work we define a two-level color-based approach, that exploits graphical visualization techniques to represent data structures of classical music, and to perform harmonic analysis of musical compositions. Our main goal is to make easier and very quick the study of classical notations (recognized as a tedious and difficult task in the field), by providing individuals with a mechanism that clarifies complex relationships in music using visual clues. We performed a preliminary study to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach as well as participants' perceptions about its usefulness and pleasantness. The results of the study provided us with overall positive feedback about the effectiveness of our approach as well as further directions to explore.

Edge Visual Encodings in Matrix-Based Diagrams
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
The most common depictions of graphs are node-link diagrams (NLDs) and matrix-based diagrams (MBDs). Making valid comparisons between these two visualisation techniques is difficult because they are each subject to a variety of representation parameters with respect to graph layout (NLD) and node ordering (MBD), meaning that any given choice of layout and order (even if they fulfil some aesthetic criteria) may influence experimental results. To overcome this problem, we propose a MBD-based technique which hybridises the entity visual encoding of a MBD with the edge visual encoding of a NLD. Using a typical MBD, we propose three edge visual encoding evolutions to ultimately render edges like in a NLD while preserving nodes depiction and order. Such encoding evolutions allow us to perform an experimental evaluation of user performances for a path finding task without the above limitations. We show that for a path finding task, our edge visual encoding evolutions tend to improve the user experience when analysing and interacting with a MBD.

Visualizing a Set of Multiple Time Series with an Aggregate Stacked Graph

Time series analysis is the centerpiece of numerous research fields from stock analysis to topic mining. While the univariate case is still commonplace, there is an increasing need for tools providing features to study the relationships between multiple time series. Initially motivated by a interdisciplinary research agenda with sociologists and musicologists, we propose an extension of the famous stacked graph to display an overview of a set of multiple and item-set time series. This visualization allows the exploration of the general tendencies observed on a population and the comparison of patterns between groups. A proof-of-concept is presented on real-life data extracted from a recent study on the daily music listening behavior.

FATuM - Fast Animated Transitions Using Multi-buffers

None
2015
The rise of Big Data and powerful mobile devices calls for libraries able to render a large number of visual elements and make fast animations without loss of frame rate. We introduce the FATuM library as a middleware for visualization. With a single abstraction for visual elements based on the work of Bertin and adaptation of the double buffering technique, we enable animated visualization of large datasets in native applications and in the browser using the same codebase. Our system does not differentiate animated from static rendering, thus reducing code complexity and guaranteeing smooth animation. We show that our system maintains 60fps for up to 200.000 visual elements in a native application and 30fps for 100.000 visual elements in a web browser.

Natural User Interface Design in DA-TU: An Interactive Clustered Data Visualization System

2015
Clustered Graph Visualization, such as DA-TU [2], has been successfully applied in the field of large scale relational data visualization for data analytics. However, it was very inefficient in interactions by using WIMP based HCI in DA-TU, in which a Control Panel was required to swap among eight different modes of operation. In this paper, we attempt to use a new multi-touch enabled NUI method for supporting interactions in DA-TU. We aim to increase the efficiency of HCI process in DA-TU. To achieve this, we first transplanted DA-TU from WIMP based PC to NUI based iPad. We then designed a set of new multi-finger gesture vocabularies to support DA-TU navigations in tablet environment. Adopting such set of rich HCI vocabularies achieves better efficiency and user experience in data exploration. We have conducted usability studies that demonstrated our hypothesis.

There have been many collective knowledge on the Web, such as evaluation of restaurants, hotels, and manufactured products. Even though each of the participants on such Web sites usually just evaluate the small number of contents, these kinds of crowd-powered contents evaluation services bring us fruitful information. Visualization is a useful tool to carefully observe the evaluation results and discover complex trends of the evaluation. This paper presents our study on visualization of the crowd-powered contents evaluation. Firstly we developed a contents evaluation technique applying an interactive genetic algorithm, which presents contents estimated to be highly or poorly evaluated. Then we had a case study with various appearances of female face images to collect the evaluations. Finally, we visualized the result by applying an image browser CAT. This paper discusses how the visualization result depicts the trends of the evaluation on appearance of women.

This paper presents a Web based Time-tunnel, a visualization system that renders 3D charts of time series multidimensional data in a web browser. The system supports to find differences and similarities among several data by overlapping their charts together. Nonetheless, if many charts are overlapped, it can be difficult to distinguish the charts. Therefore, the authors added new functionality to the system that optimizes data classification by using genetic algorithm, and then, the system came to visualize several charts of data as one group those have a strong relationship among them. In addition, users can share the visualized result with other users by specifying URL generated by the system. In this paper, the authors also justify the usability of the system by indicating visualization results of actual data.

We demonstrate our technique by means of a prototypical implementation and compare our result with existing visualization techniques.

Visual Analysis of Eye Movements by Hierarchical Filter Wheels
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
The visual exploration of spatio-temporal eye movement data is challenging, especially if we are interested in the movement patterns of a large number of study participants. For example, if popular visualization techniques like heat maps or gaze plots are used, we may lose the temporal information or get lost in visual clutter. To address these issues, we propose an approach for filtering saccadic eye movement data called hierarchical filter wheels, which employs a radial representation of saccade information. It supports the analysis of sequences of saccades by filtering them with respect to direction and length. The focus of our approach is a fast initial analysis of data from eye tracking studies without the need of defining areas of interest (AOIs) or other preprocessing of the data. The hierarchical filters are interactively generated on users' demand by creating a hierarchy of multiple filter wheels each filtering one element of the sequence. We use a bubble tree layout to represent the generated filter hierarchy. The node positions in our layout directly represent the spatial properties of the filter criteria allowing an intuitive incremental generation and understanding of filter hierarchies. We illustrate the approach by applying it to eye movement data formerly recorded in an eye tracking study investigating the readability of different node-link tree diagrams. We further demonstrate how the hierarchical filter wheels can be used in combination with gaze plots.

Concentri Cloud: Word Cloud Visualization for Multiple Text Documents
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
Word clouds provide a simple and effective means to visually communicate the most frequent words of text documents. However, only few word cloud visualizations support the contrastive analysis of multiple texts. This paper introduces Concentri Cloud, a layered word cloud layout that merges the words from several text documents into a single visualization. The weighted words are arranged in a concentric layout, with those representing the individual documents on the outer circle and the merged ones on inner circles. Interaction techniques allow to analyze the word cloud composition and to provide details on demand. The approach has been implemented and tested on several examples. A qualitative evaluation indicates the general value of Concentri Cloud and reveals benefits and limitations.

2015
Recently, a new approach for embedding visualization features into Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) programs has been proposed. It allows CHR programmers to animate and visualize different algorithms implemented in CHR. Such features have become essential with CHR being a general purpose language. In this paper, a new diagrammatic representation for CHR programs is presented. The representation is also able to account for the newly embedded visual features.

2015
Question Answering systems aim at providing answers to natural language questions and provide a solution to the problem of response accuracy. This paper describes a visual QA framework based on ontolgoies, that relies on two main components: question analysis component and answer extraction component. Our goal consists on performing an efficient question answering by: (1) Improving the representation of the question's structure using question ontology and typed attributed graphs, (2) Improving the results of question reformulation using domain ontologies and lexicosyntactic patterns (3) Extracting answers based on the question graph, lexico-syntactic patterns and score computation and (4)Offering a visual representation of the graphs and ontologies. Our framework has been implemented and evaluated.

Simplified Stress and Simplified Silhouette Coefficient to a Faster Quality Evaluation of Multidimensional Projection Techniques and Feature Spaces
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
Several multidimensional projection techniques have been proposed in literature over the last years. The quality of those techniques can be evaluated based on the dimensionality reduction or the clusters quality. The first evaluation aim to verify if the similarities from multidimensional space are preserved in projected space. While the second evaluation aim to verify if instances from a same class are placed in a same cluster in projected space. Respectively, Stress and Silhouette Coefficient are the main measures to quality evaluations. In this paper we present two new approaches -- named Simplified Stress and Simplified Silhouette Coefficient -- to speed up the computation of measures, enabling a faster evaluation of multidimensional projection techniques and feature spaces. We present experiments showing the high correlation between results obtained using original approaches and results obtained with those proposed in this paper. In addition, we show how to use Simplified Silhouette Coefficient to perform a fast feature space evaluation and selection.

Towards the Understanding of Interaction in Information Visualization

2015
Over the past few years the web has been responsible for the rise in popularity of visualizations and it seems that interactive or playable visualizations have become more popular and end up standing out more. The use of interactivity and animation has been extensively discussed in information visualization research, but there has been some controversy in relation to its benefits. Additionally, there is still little empirical evidence about its efficacy in terms of improving understanding of the data and there is few research that points out guidelines of how to incorporate it successfully and that proves that playable visualizations are indeed more enjoyable and popular among users. In order to guide future research on the actual benefits of interactivity in visualization it is important to understand what types of interactivity are currently being used in the field and to have a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques. After conducting an extensive review of popular visualizations and their interactive capabilities, we propose eleven categories of interaction techniques: filtering, selecting, abstract/elaborate, overview and explore, connect/relate, history, extraction of features, reconfigure, encode, participation/collaboration, and gamification.

Plot Balalaika: Simple Chart Designs for Long-Tail Distributed Data

Current approaches to summarising large arrays of data for presentation and communication mostly comprise reporting means with, e.g., Bar-charts. These methods are well-suited for unimodal, ideally normally-or near-normally distributed data, but are misleading for long-tail distributions that comprise most of the Big Data. We propose a succinct visualisation format, parallel in simplicity to bar-charts, that is suitable for communicating the gist of long-tail distributions, and show its efficiency empirically.

The current Brazilian context in television audiovisual communication is in transition from analogical to digital technology. One of the main reasons for this motion towards Interactive Digital Television (iDTV) is the improvement in the user experience over this platform. Considering this motion, this work applied suitable interaction design and usability concepts from the Nielsen's heuristics [5] into a visualization prototype to the support of visual analysis of products in electronic commerce over TV (t-commerce). In this work we conducted a usability check in an existing information visualization prototype, in order establish whether or not it follows usability standards and in order to make it more usable to the user.

Antescofo is a state-of-the-art software package for mixed music authorship and performance. In this paper, we apply an information visualisation perspective to a set of revisions in the timeline-based representation of action items in Asco Graph, the dedicated user interface to Antescofo. Our contribution is two-fold: (a) a design study of the proposed new model, and (b) a technical, algorithmic component. In the former, we show how our model relates to principles of information coherence and clarity, facility of seeking and navigation, hierarchical distinction and explicit linking. In the latter, we frame the problem of arranging action rectangles in a 2D space as a strip packing problem, with the additional constraint that the (horizontal) time coordinates of each block are fixed. We introduce three algorithms of increasing complexity for automatic arrangement, estimate their packing performance and analyse their strengths and weaknesses. We evaluate the systemic improvements achieved and their applicability for other time-based datasets, while noting the limitations of the model and resulting directions for future research.

An Analysis and Visualization Tool for DBLP Data

The Digital Bibliography and Library Project (DBLP) is a popular computer science bibliography website hosted at the University of Trier in Germany. It currently contains 2,722,212 computer science publications with additional information about the authors and conferences, journals, or books in which these are published. Although the database covers the majority of papers published in this field of research, it is still hard to browse the vast amount of textual data manually to find insights and correlations in it, in particular time-varying ones. This is also problematic if someone is merely interested in all papers of a specific topic and possible correlated scientific words which may hint at related papers. To close this gap, we propose an interactive tool which consists of two separate components, namely data analysis and data visualization. We show the benefits of our tool and explain how it might be used in a scenario where someone is confronted with the task of writing a state-of-the art report on a specific topic. We illustrate how data analysis, data visualization, and the human user supported by interaction features can work together to find insights which makes typical literature search tasks faster.

We present a new metaphor that takes advantages of concepts such as archipelagos, atolls, and palms. Each package of a software system is represented as an atoll that maintainers can navigate and interact with. Atolls that form an archipelago represent the entire system. Maintainers can pass from an atoll to another one, so understanding how the entire software and its packages are related with one another. Palms on an atoll graphically depict salient information of the classes contained in the package associated to that atoll. The metaphor has been implemented as a 3D interactive environment tool to allow a fine- and large-grained understanding of a subject software system implemented in Java. Finally, we have used our 3D environment on a number of open-source object-oriented software systems and the obtained results are preliminarily presented in this paper.

A photogenic location is a good place to take photos. It generally has beautiful scenery, historical structures, etc. When amateur photographers plan a photo trip, they often decide beforehand on photogenic locations to visit. They collect information about the locations and consider various aspects. The aim of the authors is to assist amateur photographers in planning a photo trip. Information and procedures have been organized to help select photogenic locations from the perspective of information design. In addition, an interactive visual tool has been developed to help select photogenic locations. The tool displays information on photogenic locations extracted from a large collection of geotagged photos, provided by a photo-sharing site. The tool allows us to select locations while referring to their geographic relationships. Consequently, the process of selecting photogenic locations becomes easy.

Creating complex 3D polygonal models using existing modelling software can be challenging. Most 3D Modelling software have been designed for 2D displays and lack support for effective perception of depth ordering. Studies have shown that users of these types of software encounter a range of focus and context awareness problems while performing their 3D modelling tasks. We have previously developed a number of visualization and interaction techniques to better support focus and context awareness using multi-layered displays. A user study of these techniques has demonstrated that they need further improvements. Here, we present three modified visualization techniques, which as shown by a user study, improve the effectiveness of these previous alternatives.

I have enhanced Metric Attitude. It is a visualization tool based on static analysis that provides a mental picture by viewing an object-oriented software system by means of polymetric views. In particular, we have integrated an Information Retrieval engine and named this new version of visualization tool as Metric Attitude++. It allows the user to formulate a textual query and to show on the visual representation of the subject software the elements that are more similar to that query. This could be useful in all those cases in which a user needs to identify (or to localize) features implemented in the source code. Several filters are also available to hide possibly irrelevant details and to ease the browsing and then the comprehension of a software system. Finally, we have applied Metric Attitude++ on a number of object-oriented software systems. In this paper, we report preliminary results of a quantitative study on a widely studied open-source software, namely JEdit. On the basis of our results it seems that Metric Attitude++ can be effectively applied to different kinds of source code comprehension tasks and to concept location in source code, in particular.

The growing use of smart electricity meters means that real-time information relating to residential electricity consumption is readily available. The globally recognized need to manage and improve the efficiency of our use of electricity, and the need in most jurisdictions to increase the integration and utilization of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources, provides a strong motivation for individuals to be aware of their electricity consumption in real-time, and to manage that consumption according to need (imperative, background or discretionary activities) and availability of energy. This paper describes the development and preliminary evaluation of a dashboard-like display, implemented on a mobile platform (phone or tablet), which provides both an instant overview and awareness of consumption and availability, and facility to drill down to determine detail, and potentially to control individual appliances.

Interactively Uncluttering Node Overlaps for Network Visualization
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
Visual interaction with networks have been promising in the sense that we can successfully elucidate underlying relationships hidden behind complicated mutual relationships such as co-authorship networks, product co purchasing networks, and scale-free social networks. However, it is still burdensome to alleviate visual clutter arising from overlaps among node labels especially in such interactive environments as the networks become dense in terms of the topological connectivity. This paper presents a novel approach for dynamically rearranging the network layouts by incorporating centroidal Voronoi tessellation for better readability of node labels. Our idea is to smoothly transform the network layouts obtained through the conventional force-directed algorithm to that produced by the centroidal Voronoi tessellation to seek a plausible compromise between them. We also incorporated the Chebyshev distance metric into the centroidal Voronoi tessellation while adaptively adjusting the aspect ratios of the Voronoi cells so that we can place rectangular labels compactly over the network nodes. Finally, we applied the proposed approach to relatively large networks to demonstrate the feasibility of our formulation especially in interactive environments.

Adjasankey: Visualization of Huge Hierarchical Weighted and Directed Graphs

Visualization of hierarchical weighted and directed graphs are usually done with node-link or adjacency matrix diagrams. However, these representations suffer from various drawbacks: low readability in a context of Big Data, high number of edge crossings, difficulty to efficiently represent the weighting. With the stated goal of reducing these drawbacks, we designed Adjasankey, a hybrid visual representation of weighted and directed graphs using hierarchical abstractions. This technique combines adjacency matrices readability of large graphs and flow diagrams visual design efficiency for weighting depiction. Associated to Big Data computing and light-weight web rendering, our tool allows to depict and interact in real time on huge dataset and supports user multi-scale exploration and analysis. To show the efficiency of Adjasankey, we present a case study on the analysis of a Customer to Customer website.

Literature Visualization and Similarity Measurement Based on Citation Relations

While similar documents are, traditionally, found using Natural Language Processing, we observe reference/citation information by authors indicates better insight of similarity. Our system is to retrieve publications from Google Scholar and visualize them as a 2D graph using the citation relation, where the nodes represent the documents while the links represent the citation/reference relation between them. We measure the similarity score between each pair of papers based on both the number of paths and the length of each path. More paths and shorter the lengths higher the similarity score. We compared them with another similarity scores from Scurtu's Document Similarity API [1] that uses Natural Language Processing. We use the average of the similarity scores collected from 15 users as a ground truth to determine how good the scores from two methods are. The result shows that our citation network approach gives better results than the ones by Scurtu's.

A Concurrent Architecture Proposal for Information Visualization Pipeline

This paper identifies an opportunity to reduce the latency in information visualization (InfoVis) systems, exploring the parallelization of the visualization pipeline architecture. We propose a concurrent architecture where the visualization pipeline stages are modified to execute as producers and consumers threads. The threads synchronization is done by memory barriers and the data flow pass the pipeline through a unique data structure, called ring buffer, which reuses a contiguous space preallocated in memory. Two InfoVis prototypes were developed in java, the first one using sequential pipeline and the other using concurrent pipeline. The results obtained with concurrent architecture in comparison with sequential pipeline presented less execution time and memory allocation for data visualization renderization.

Self-Organizing Map-Based Feature Visualization and Selection for Defect Depth Estimation in Oil and Gas Pipelines
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) sensors are commonly utilized to detect defects in oil and gas pipelines and determine their depths and sizes. As a preprocessing step, MFL data are often reduced into a representative feature set that is capable of accurately estimating pipeline defect depths. However, this estimation capability may vary depending on the features used, which necessitates the need for selecting the most relevant ones. In this paper, self-organizing maps (SOMs) are used as feature visualization tool for the purpose of selecting the most appropriate features. First, a self-organizing map (SOM), i.e., A two-dimensional discretized representation of the input space of the training samples for the features, is produced. The SOM weights for each individual input feature (weight plane) are displayed then visually analyzed. Irrelevant and redundant features can be efficiently spotted and removed. The remaining "good" features (i.e., Selected features) are then used as an input to a feed forward neural network for defect depth estimation. Experimental work has shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach. For instance, within &#x00B1;5% error-tolerance range, the obtained estimation accuracy, using the SOM-based feature selection, is 93.1%, compared to 74% when all input features are used (i.e., No feature selection is performed), and within &#x00B1;10% error-tolerance range, the obtained estimation accuracy, using the SOM-based feature selection, is 97.5%, compared to 86% when all the input features are used (i.e., No feature selection is performed).

Recommender systems are becoming common tools supporting automatic, context-based retrieval of resources. When the number of retrieved resources grows large visual tools are required that leverage the capacity of human vision to analyse large amounts of information. We introduce a Web-based visual tool for exploring and organising recommendations retrieved from multiple sources along dimensions relevant to cultural heritage and educational context. Our tool provides several views supporting filtering in the result set and integrates a bookmarking system for organising relevant resources into topic collections. Building upon these features we envision a system which derives user's interests from performed actions and uses this information to support the recommendation process. We also report on results of the performed usability evaluation and derive directions for further development.

Fast Graph Drawing Algorithm Revealing Networks Cores

2015
Graph is a powerful tool to model relationships between elements and has been widely used in different research areas. Size and complexity of newly acquired graphs prohibit manual representations and urge a need for automatic visualization methods. We are interested with the node-links diagram which represents each node as a glyph and edge as a line between the corresponding nodes. % We present a novel layout algorithm that emphasizes the cores of very large networks (up to several hundred thousand of nodes and million of edges) in few seconds or minutes. Our method uses a hierarchical coreness decomposition of the graph and a combination of existing layout algorithms according to the clusters topologies. Area-aware drawing algorithms which produce node overlap-free drawings are used to reduce the visual clutter. Edges are bundled along the hierarchy of clusters to highlight the network communities and reduce edge visual clutter. % We validated our approach by comparing our method against one of the fastest method of the state of the art on a benchmark of 23 large graphs extracted from various sources. We have statistically proved that our method performs faster while providing meaningful results.

Mental Map Models for Edges

2015
When drawing a graph, the user's actions on the graph may lead to a drawing which is very different from the drawing before the interaction. The established aesthetic criteria are not sufficient to allow the users to fully track the changes to the graph. The mental map of nodes and edges is lost. We have taken the existing work, which focused on mental maps for nodes, and extended it naturally to the edges. This may be useful in applications where the nodes are stable and only the edges are redrawn. We present two models that allow edges to be drawn to preserve the mental map as much as possible. Our preliminary tests indicate that the produced edge drawing is similar to the original one and the other aesthetic criteria have mostly been preserved.

Hybrid Visualization: A New Approach to Display Instances Relationship and Attributes Behaviour in a Single View
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
Visualization techniques have been widely used in dataset exploration. A common strategy is to employ different techniques to facilitate the exploratory process, enabling different perspectives from the same dataset. In this case, a coordination mechanism aids the user in the context changing among different views. However, to keep track of the highlighted data elements among multiple views is an unclear task. To reach a better exploration by using distinct visualization techniques and graphical representations, some approaches have adopted the strategy of combining different techniques in a single view, creating a Hybrid Visualization which can avoid the use of coordination. This paper proposes a new Hybrid Visualization approach that integrates Multidimensional Projection and Parallel Coordinates to display the instances relationship and attributes behaviour in a single view. As presented in this paper, the applications of this approach enable a better feature space exploration, aiding users to understand why instances from the same or distinct classes are grouped.

A Visualization of Research Papers Based on the Topics and Citation Network
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2015
Survey of research papers is not an easy task for novice researchers, because they are not always good at finding all appropriate keywords for the survey. Moreover, it is not easy for them to understand positions of papers in their research fields instantly, even when they use famous search engines like Google Scholar, it may often take a long time for them to find scholarly literature. On the other hand, many researchers have presented citation visualization techniques for surveying research papers. However, it is still often difficult to observe the complicated relations across multiple research fields or traverse the entire relations in their interest.

Regularity Measure and Influence Weight for Analysis and Visualization of Consumer's Attitude
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2015
Recently, analysis of massive purchase histories is thought to be effective for marketing science. For successful sales strategies and advertisements, understanding of consumer's attitude (motivation toward purchasing) is important. However, marketers could obtain merely static attitude for the limited consumers using subjective questionnaires. We focus on purchase rhythm (regularity) as one approach to automatically extracting dynamic attitude transition. We propose "regular behavior measure" which quantifies how well each purchase corresponds to the user's own daily habits. It considers non-periodic habits as well as periodic habits using multiple probabilistic models, we consider purchase probability and the number of purchased dates simultaneously. We also define "influence weight" to quantify whether each item is purchased on a fixed day of the week (DoW) or year-month (YM) using Normalized Mutual Information. We analyze actual purchase data to show the effectiveness of our visualization that considers consumer's regularity transitions.

A Visualization-Analytics-Interaction Workflow Framework for Exploratory and Explanatory Search on Geo-located Search Data Using the Meme Media Digital Dashboard

Modern geo-position system (GPS) enabled smart phones are generating an increasing volume of information about their users, including geo-located search, movement, and transaction data. While this kind of data is increasingly rich and offers many grand opportunities to identify patterns and predict behaviour of groups and individuals, it is not immediately obvious how to develop a framework for extracting plausible inferences from these data. In our case, we have access to a large volume (more than half a billion individual records) of real user data from the Point smart phone application, and we have developed a generic and layered system architecture to incrementally find aggregate items of interest within that data. "Interest" is based on the semantics of the data, so include time and space correlations, e.g., Are people searching for dinner and a movie, distributions of usage patterns and platforms, e.g., Geographic distribution of Android, Apple, and Black-Berry users, and clustering to identify interesting and relatively complex search and movement patterns, e.g., Consumer trajectories from key word searches. Our integration of visualization tools is thus guided top-down, by semantic concepts in the application domain, rather than by bottom-up tool development. Our presentation here is preliminary in that we provide sketches of case-studies that demonstrate an application specific integration of the three major components of modern visual analytics: visualization, analytics, and interaction (VAI). Our case-study sketches show how an interactive system for visual data exploration can be used to alternate between exploratory search -- looking for ideas and new hypothesis in data -- and explanatory search -- looking for evidence to support a hypothesis. While we have not yet formulated experiments to directly measure the cognitive efficacy of our experimental system, we believe that our semantically-driven VAI workflows and the integration of visual methods and interaction provides some useful ideas about how to extend current frameworks for visual analytics systems.

In exploratory analysis of multivariate datasets, performing an analytical task is often necessary. Such tasks may include extracting characteristic subsets and comparing them. Therefore, we support searching and comparing features of multivariate datasets. We developed Blade Graph, which is a visualization technique for comparing distributions by emphasizing coloring according to the size of the difference. In addition, we developed a visual analysis tool with representations for comparing data distributions. In a case study of our analysis tool, we analyzed collective tendencies from a social media dataset.

Feature analysis is always beneficial to the detection of anonymous criminals in digital forensics, including people and activities, where vast amount of features extracted from databases are involved. Not all features extracted are continuous or different, some of them are discrete or have the same value with others. We discovered that using visual analytics to select features for forensic investigations is not only improve the analysis time of selection, but can also deeply and obviously display the slight changes of features and criminals and also the relationship between features and criminals in order to find the target with significant difference with others, and also predict the more active features to be used in the future. Experiments show that visual feature analysis can help to catch the desire results quickly and clearly.

Visual Analysis of Car Fleet Trajectories to Find Representative Routes for Automotive Research
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
Testing is an important and wide spread practice in the development of automotive components. For the design of test methods two types of input data are often considered: (1) load data gathered from real life vehicle fleets, and (2) information of the driving routes based on road features. The development of new technologies is though complicated not only by the need to join those two data sources, but also by the too limited knowledge of the parameters and their useful combinations. As a result, information about representative driving profiles is needed. To address these problems we present a visual analytics approach for analyzing multivariate trajectories as a combination of vehicle's location and road elevation data. Our system combines trajectory clustering, interval-based user-driven trip segmentation, and frequent sequences analysis, supported by contingency table and interval-based Parallel Coordinates visualization and enables the expert user to find representative driving profiles for the definition of very compact test courses.

We study in this paper the visualization of large multidimensional datasets with a focus on Open Data. Starting from our early work in which we defined a visualization based on points of interest, we improve this method in several ways with the aim of dealing with larger datasets and especially Open datasets. We propose the parallelization, using CPU and GPU, of the most costly steps of our method, like the computation of the data layout. We improve the visualization with a density rendering so as to keep the display informative for large datasets and for Open Data. We propose a layered visualization with interactions that can support several users tasks such as data filtering and labeling. We show that, even with common hardware, the performances of our approach are such that any user graphical queries can be processed in a few seconds. We detail how we were able to visualize and explore a collection of 300,000 Open datasets from the French Open Data web site. With the resulting visualization, we were able to improve our previous results.

Knowledge Visualization can be a valuable support for facilitating a number of cognitive and collaborative tasks in organizations. The aim of this paper is to provide concrete evidence of how visual templates provide useful support for teams, which lead to higher quality of idea generation and sharing, compared to unstructured meetings. Evidence is provided through the illustration of a field study conducted in a multinational telecommunication company and a series of laboratory experiments. Results show that visually structuring meetings improves the number of high quality ideas developed, and increased knowledge shared and remembered.

Many contemporary research tasks require complex decision making and interdisciplinary collaboration among different groups of experts and stakeholders. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the planning and design of future cities - rapidly growing cities where the development and allocation of energy, housing, transportation and other scarce resources requires the active participation of architects, urban planners, government stakeholders and private citizens. In this paper, we show how recent advances in display technology can facilitate such collaboration and create new opportunities for participatory urban planning. We introduce the Value Lab Asia as a model for collaborative planning and value creation, and show how a multi-screen display management framework called the Tool Library integrates the laboratory's physical and software infrastructure with the planning process.

The Design Process: A Visual Model

2015
Knowledge visualizations are often created by practitioners and managers, not necessarily by expert graphic designers. Non-experts -- as well as novice designers -- can be puzzled and overwhelmed by the complexity of the design process: it is unclear how to start and which are the main phases and their sequence. Often times even experienced designers mistakenly start by selecting a tool or a solution, instead of considering the audience and its needs. The aim of this conceptual piece is to assemble the main phases (and related procedures and tools) of the design process to provide a pragmatic visual guide for students and practitioners. It also highlights the highly cyclical nature of designing through a structured iterative process of prototyping and testing. The model can be utilized for a broad spectrum of applications, including the creation of knowledge visualization, information visualizations, graphic design or other types of product. The examples provided in this paper are specifically related to knowledge visualization.

Dynamic Multi-view, Multi-format, Multi-user Visualizations: For Future Cities
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
This paper introduces the concept of dynamic Multi-View, Multi-Format, Multi-User Visualizations. It also suggests aligning all visualization branches to a common problem, namely the design and implementation of future sustainable cities, such as Jakarta, Indonesia. While a lot of visualization research has extensively discussed the emotional, cognitive and coordinative benefits of visual representations, the application of such tools to solve grand societal problems has been neglected. We suggest focusing on Future Cities, since they require solutions and because the field seems to be ideal to align the various subgroups of visualization research. We derived this insight from about 1000 events in our physical value lab and our own software development - the Visual Manager and the Shuffler. The Visual Manager uses visual metaphors to illustrate risk assessment scenarios. The Shuffler is a framework to create coordinated multiple views. The innovative part of this framework is that different visual representations, complementary business logics and datasets can be distributed to different views, which calls for more transdisciplinary work in the design of dynamic multi-view, multi-format and multi-user software. This paper is relevant for researchers in all subgroups of visualization research - especially Knowledge Visualization and Information Visualization.

A Gesture Control Framework Targeting High-Resolution Video Wall Displays

This recent advances in display and user interface technologies create new opportunities for participatory urban planning. Whereas touch screens enable direct screen interactions for intuitive remodeling of urban simulations, high resolution video walls offer true-to-life or human-scale scenario visualizations. Multi-touch screen environments finally function as an interactive user interface for the entire urban simulation pipeline. However intuitive and preferably natural interactions for simple reconfiguration, overarching tool management or complex tool interaction remain a major challenge. For this reason we have implemented a gesture recognition framework that uses multimodal input devices to satisfy all gesture use cases and integrates a display management system for seamless interaction with our multi-screen infrastructure. To understand the implications of this novel approach, we conducted preliminary user trials with urban planning experts and technicians. The results indicated that the system provides a fluid and natural user experience for exploring and analyzing urban planning data.

None
2015
Micro-level visual phenomena significantly impact visually-supported interactions, and require further exploration. This study uses a laboratory experiment with managerial participants to examine the impact of typeface appearance on number of comments concerning collaboration process during use of an electronic ideation platform. The typefaces verifiably differed on perceived finishedness (PF) level. Low typeface PF was expected to lead to freer, more frequent interaction on the collaboration process. Contrary to expectations, this study found that participant familiarity with the high PF typeface led to a significant increase in the amount of collaboration process comments. This study examines the complementary new ideation metric of collaboration comment number in light of the benefits social metacognition can bring to the structuring of group creativity processes.

Knowminer Search - A Multi-visualisation Collaborative Approach to Search Result Analysis

The amount of information available on the internet and within enterprises has reached an incredible dimension. Efficiently finding and understanding information and thereby saving resources remains one of the major challenges in our daily work. Powerful text analysis methods, a scalable faceted retrieval engine and a well-designed interactive user interface are required to address the problem. Besides providing means for drilling-down to the relevant piece of information, a part of the challenge arises from the need of analysing and visualising data to discover relationships and correlations, gain an overview of data distributions and unveil trends. Visual interfaces leverage the enormous bandwidth of the human visual system to support pattern discovery in large amounts of data. Our Know miner search builds upon the well-known faceted search approach which is extended with interactive visualisations allowing users to analyse different aspects of the result set. Additionally, our system provides functionality for organising interesting search results into portfolios, and also supports social features for rating and boosting search results and for sharing and annotating portfolios.

Navicons for Collaboration - Navigating and Augmenting Discussions through Visual Annotations
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2015
As discussions move online, we need means that compensate for what we take for granted in face-to-face meetings: voice modulation, mimics, or gestures. There are three functions of these 'metadiscoursive' expressions: 1) to navigate conversations and to direct the attention of our interlocutors, deciding what to discuss, reviewing what has been said, or how things are framed 2) to signal attitudes such as agreement or disagreement, or the level of certainty or commitment and 3) to annotate (visual) content with comments. These functions are crucial for the quality of discussions and can benefit from information visualization. To do this, we propose a classification of navigational moves and attitudes and their visual representation in form of "Navicons" and "Atticons". These icons help to improve the quality of online or face to face discussions, to plan conversations in advance, or to analyze past discussions. An example and outlook conclude the paper.

Simulation and Visualization of Deformation with Anisotropic Materials
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation

2015
Physically based deformable models have been a hot topic in the computer graphics and visualization community. However, most of the implemented models work only for isotropic materials, leaving the more general anisotropic materials less studied. We look into the challenging issues in dynamics simulation and real time visualization for anisotropic materials, and present our theoretic and practical work along the way to provide an ultimate solution to deformation with such materials. First, our models are based on continuum mechanics and approximated by the Finite Element Method, and different approaches such as co rotated, invertible, and total Lagrangian explicit dynamics. Secondly, for controls of the deformation, we have focused on materials that have their own internal structures (fibers) that determine the dynamics behaviors. We propose a fibers incorporated deformable model that can approximate the anisotropic elastic material properties. The orientation information is combined into the existing deformable models by element transformations along the given directions, which provide a control of the desired deformation. Thirdly, constraints for the strain density in linear elastic models are analyzed, and a positive-definite elasticity tensor is derived for an anisotropic material. Fourthly, an orthotropic deformation controlling frame-field is conceptualized and the frame construction tool is developed for the user to define the desired material properties. A quaternion Laplacian smoothing algorithm is designed for propagating the rotation minimization frames into the entire object. And finally, the co rotational linear FEM model is coupled with the orthotropic frame-field to realize a dynamics system, which can deal with large anisotropic deformations.

Visualization applications can be performed on distinct platforms, such as mobile devices and multi-projection systems. Each platform offers specific features to provide further data understanding, and a system that integrates these platforms in a complementary manner is a real challenge. In this paper, we present an immersive and interactive visualization system that aims to explore data from relational databases using 3D graphs representations, where multiple simultaneous users can visualize and interact with the data through a multi-projection system and mobile devices. A single visualization application was created for both platforms using the Unity game engine, and an Unity external package for Virtual Reality applications development, that supports multi-projection system over a PC cluster and passive stereoscopy. Our visualization system aims to provide the users a better data understanding using a 3-screens multi-projection system as data overview, and mobile devices as display and interaction device for navigation and additional information visualization. We also introduce an user case, where the visualization system is used in order to support developers regarding structural problems in a large relational database.

Image-Based Hair Pre-processing for Art Creation: A Case Study of Bas-Relief Modelling

None
2015
To better capture the shapes as well as the rich dynamics of hair, image based modelling techniques have been developed for reconstructing their 3D geometry and important visual features. Most hair images contain inevitable noises which impair reconstructed hair models. Therefore we propose to pre-process hair images and provide an orientation map of hair strands to enhance the follow-on modelling. To demonstrate the usage of pre-processing techniques, we apply our pre-processing results for bas-relief stylisation and modelling of hair from image inputs. We compare different techniques to estimate hair orientations, adopting four types of filter mechanisms. Our analysis of their performance sheds insight on designing a suitable pre-processing technique for hair reconstruction from images. Several examples of bas-relief creation validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The evolution and affordability of depth cameras like Microsoft Kinect make it a great source for object detection and surveillance monitoring. Information available from depth cameras includes depth in addition to color. Using depth cameras, the provided depth information can be incorporated for object detection in still and video images, but needs special care to pair it with color information. In this work, we propose a simple, yet novel real time unsupervised object detection method in spatio-temporal videos. The RGB color frame is mapped into Hunter Lab color space to reduce emphasis on image illuminations, while the depth frame is back-projected into the 3D real world coordinate in order to distinguish between objects in space. Once combined, the mapped color information and the back-projected depth information are fed into automatic, unsupervised clustering framework in order to detect scene objects. The framework runs in parallel to provide real time spatio-temporal object detection.

Video Object Tracking Using Interactive Segmentation and Superpixel Based Gaussian Kernel

2015
A novel non-rigid video object tracking based on interactive segmentation and super pixel Gaussian kernel is proposed in this paper. In the initialization stage, instead of using the traditional bounding box to locate the targeted object, we employed an interactive segmentation with user-defined marker to segment the object accurately in the first frame of the input video to avoid the background influence in the traditional bounding box. During the tracking stage, using a Gaussian kernel as movement constraint, each super pixel is tracked independently to locate the object in the next frame. Experimental results show that the proposed method compared to state of the art methods can achieve better robustness and accuracy for various challenging video clips.

2015
With the availability of free online enrichment services injection of additional, external resources in existing Web content becomes more and more widespread. For the specific area of just-in-time retrieval of digital resources based on web page content, there are no specific guidelines of how to design and integrate the additional user interface components. In this paper, we conceptualise related user interface issues, investigating the central questions: (i) how can a user be visually notified that additional results are available, and (ii) with which user interface elements should the results be presented. Concretely, we identified four different notification styles and six different result presentation styles. In a survey-based study with 75 participants we elicited the users' preferences, revealing a clear preference for the representation style (split pane) and a strong preference for three notification styles (notification bubble, icon appearance and change of icon's appearance). The latter preferences are related to the preferred browser. The results can serve as guideline for designing web-based user interfaces for just-in-time retrieval.

Employing media visualization techniques, we generated three visualizations based on the created dataset containing the metadata about the illustrations. In the visualizations, we used the actual media artifacts as representation of data instead of the graphical primitives like points. The resulting visualizations make it possible to explore the collection of the illustrations in historical and geographical contexts.

Senescence: An Age-Based Character Simulation Framework
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
The paper presents the development and initial validation of the Senescence character framework, a simulation tool that can be used for rigging muscle deformer-based humanoid characters, with support for age. The senescence framework allows the user to rig any bipedal 3D character and manipulate skeleton and muscle parameters in order to render the age of the character realistically. The framework was developed using Python, Maya Embedded Language and PyQt. A study with 100 subjects was conducted to determine whether participants were able to perceive the age of the characters simulated with the Senescence framework. Findings show that while subjects were able to perceive age differences, they were not able to identify the age of the simulated characters with high level of accuracy. Results also show that subjects with animation expertise were able to identify the age of the characters more accurately than subjects without animation experience.

Examining User Experiences through a Multimodal BCI Puzzle Game
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation

This paper presents a study of users' experiences in low cost multimodal brain-computer interface (BCI) games. A 2D puzzle game (Tetris) was designed featuring two modes (non-BCI and BCI input) which require users to meditate in order to change the game difficulty. Thirty participants were asked to report on the two modes separately. Results indicate that a one-sensor BCI device in games positively contributes to enjoy ability but raises mental demand. There was no reported drop in performance in a hybrid system where direct control is not handled by a BCI input. It was found that meditation could not be self-regulated making short-term direct control a bad design decision in future BCI gaming scenarios for one-sensor headsets.

Perceived Realism of Crowd Behaviour with Social Forces
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
This paper investigates the development of an urban crowd simulation for the purposes of psychophysical experimentation. Whilst artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing to produce more concise and interesting crowd behaviours, the number or sophistication of the algorithms implemented within a system does not necessarily guarantee its perceptual realism. Human perception is highly subjective and does not always conform to the reality of the situation. Therefore it is important to consider this aspect when dealing with A implementations within a crowd system aimed at humans. In this research an initial two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) with constant stimuli psychophysical experiment is presented. The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether human participants perceive crowd behaviour with a social forces model to be more realistic. Results from the experiment suggest that participants do consider crowd behaviour with social forces to be more realistic. This research could inform the development of crowd-based systems, especially those that consider viewer perception to be important, such as for example video games and other media.

2015
Virtual reality is a good tool to design and assess urban projects and to study perception in cities. Climate perception significantly influences the perception and use of urban spaces, however, virtual urban environments are scarcely represented with different climatic aspects. In this paper, we study the role that visual cues (sky aspect, shadows, sun location, and light effects) specifically play in climate perception (season, daytime and temperature) in virtual urban environments. We present and discuss the data we collected from a recent virtual reality experiment in which ten variations of the climatic context in the same urban space were assessed.

2015
This paper presents the development and testing of a computational design tool applicable on a Tangible User Interface for conceptual design stages. Drawing and sketching are spatial and hap tic processes for conceptualizing and communicating ideas especially within design teams of Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industry. Therefore, the application of interactive surfaces within co-located collaborative design teams provides an integration of different sensory modalities, including visual and hap tic, thus resulting into a richer and more coherent design experience. The paper explores the evolution of technology related to design systems and describes the development of a conceptual design application for a M.S. Pixel Sense. This development was part of an action-based research and the evolution of the software during a number of tests with design professionals is presented accordingly. Eventually, the paper concludes with suggestions for further research on augmented reality applications for design processes within the built environment.

Monuments Visualization: From 3D Scanned Data to a Holistic approach, an Application to the City of Aberdeen
2015 19th International Conference on Information Visualisation
None
2015
This paper aims to present the process of visualizing historic statues of the city of Aberdeen. 3D laser scanning was the main method utilized to obtain the 3D data, which was then transformed into a series of 3D surface models. A laser scanner typically has a range of over 100m (300m for the equipment used here), and records data to levels of accuracy almost impossible to achieve using 'traditional' surveying techniques. The data recorded by a scanner takes the form of a 'point cloud', which can be combined with on-site photographs to build up a realistic and accurate virtual model. The paper concludes with discussion of how such data can be readily transferred into industry-standard Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) models, thus, allowing the compilation of a buildings and monuments 'library' available to the city council and to the public for future urban projects and city regeneration. It is argued that the ability to incorporate data extracted from 3D scan-based models will promote the easier implementation of the 3D information within digital arts, architecture, structural engineering or other purposes. The paper represents an interesting collaboration between disciplines from architecture and computing, and provides a practical and innovative case study which sits between technical advances, and electronic and visual arts.

To improve safety and ease operations in using the medical imaging devices and increase the influx of digital imagery, there is a need for Radiology Information System (RIS) and Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) to be used in conjunction to establish a secure network for transmission of patient information. We present a web-based RIS and PACS information retrieval and visualization system implemented for diagnostic radiology, addressing its benefits in workflow improvements, operational efficiencies and convenience for the users. The web application is based on the functional and non-functional requirements elicited on three major user groups, namely, patient, referring physician and radiologist. Novel methodology in the system design and visual analytics is also reported, including Use Case Design, Use Case Descriptions, Database Design, Web Navigation and Activity Diagrams. Experimental results are given to show its effective applications in a clinical setup.

Hierarchical fiber clustering is a promising way to analyze brain connectivity. A disadvantage of hierarchical fiber clustering is its difficult visualization. The simple presentation as a 2D tree is visually too complex because of the amount of several thousand leaves. We present a framework that allows the modification of the dendrogram visualization in a flexible way. The modified dendrogram visualization can convey additional information that grants an easier orientation within the hierarchical clustering. Besides the interaction with the dendrogram itself, it is also possible to make use of a 3D view and a clustering preview. To illustrate potential use cases, we present two usage examples that show the versatility of our framework.

Interactive visualization of medical data plays an increasingly vital role in clinical diagnosis. Cluttered views, lack of visual cues, etc. Are some of the problems that exist specially when projecting a 3D rendering of a Computed Tomography data on a 2D screen. In this paper we proposed two synthetic visual cues. They facilitate perception by removing visual clutter while maintaining context, directing viewers' attention to the object of interest, and consequently enhancing clinical diagnosis. Our proposed cues can be used both individually or combined with any other existing cues. Although our methods have been created with medical visualization in mind, it is possible to use them in other volume rendering applications as well.

The exploration of biomedical data which involves heterogeneous sources coming from different spatial scales and medical domains is a challenging topic in current research. In this work, we combine efforts regarding multi-scale visualization, multimodal interaction and knowledge formalization for the exploration of multi-scale biomedical data. The knowledge formalization stores and organizes the information sources, the integrated visualization captures all relevant information for the domain expertise of the user and the multimodal interaction provides a natural exploration. We present a concrete example of use of the proposed exploratory system designed for a biologist investigating multi-scale pathologies.

Computers have been used for language therapy for aphasia persons. It is known that the usage of computer is effective for it. There are many problems for it but our interests are especially about the aspect of information visualization and interaction between computers and aphasia persons. In this paper, we report a prototype of rehabilitation system and the evaluation of the system by aphasia persons and speech therapists (STs). Aphasia persons have troubles to understand language. Most of them have troubles to read sentences. Also most of them have troubles to write characters and also lines in hand because the cause of aphasia is damages to the left part of brain. The proposed rehabilitation system allows aphasia persons to undergo treatment without writing characters or lines. Since they are not good at reading sentences, the user interface is designed especially using information visualization, as few characters. The evaluation of the system by aphasia persons and STs results good grade and both of them want to use the rehabilitation system by tablet computers much further.

Undoubtedly, visualization of the trajectory clustering outputs is very important and some researches have been done on visualization of the clustering results. Still importantly, the research on visualizing the procedure of clustering, which is also of great value, is little touched. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D visualization tool, which comprehensively illustrates the Agglomerative Information Bottleneck (AIB) based clustering scheme, to help users understand the clustering approach vividly and clearly. The point of the proposed metaphor makes use of the visualization, together with rich interactions, to demonstrate the iterative clustering procedure, the corresponding results and the clustering results. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our 3D visualization tool for trajectory analysis.

The Internet has played an important role as a knowledge-sharing network and in this context some service oriented architecture (SOA) applications have emerged in all kind of study fields. Therefore, this work aims the design and development of a service aggregation that will favor ubiquity and pervasiveness in data visualization applications, allowing users to build domain-specific data visualizations in an easy and intuitive way. With this kind of service, it is possible to build data visualization applications for different smart devices such as smartphones, tablets, desktop, smart TV's, etc. A Web API that supports the main functionalities of an information visualization tool in different platforms has been proposed to reaches these purposes. The REST (Representational State Transfer) Style has been employed in the service conception as the architectural communication model. Client-side and server-side applications were developed using Java with a data visualization generator engine called PRISMA.

Isoline-Enhanced Dynamic Graph Visualization
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
Static or dynamic graphs are typically visualized by either node-link diagrams, adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, orhybrids thereof. In particular, for the case of a changing graphstructure a viewer wishes to be able to visually compare thegraphs in a sequence. Doing such a comparison task rapidlyand reliably can give support to visually analyze the dynamicgraph for certain dynamic patterns. In this paper we describe a novel dynamic graph visualization that is based on the concept of smooth density fields generated by first splatting the links of a given graph in a certain layout. To further visually enhance the time-varying graph structures we add user-adaptable isolines to the resulting dynamic graph representation. The computed visual encoding of the dynamic graph is aesthetically appealing due to its smooth curves and can additionally be used to do comparisons in a long graph sequence, i.e., from an information visualization perspective it serves as an overview representation supporting to start more detailed analyses processes. To demonstrate theusefulness of the technique we explore real-world dynamic graph data by taking into account visual parameters like node-link layouts, smoothing iterations, number of isolines, and different color codings.

People flow information brings us useful knowledge in various industrial and social fields including traffic, disaster prevention and marketing. However, it is still an open problem to develop effective people flow analysis techniques. We suppose compression and data mining techniques are especially important for analysis and visualization of large-scale people flow datasets. This paper presents a visualization tool for large-scale people flow dataset featuring compression and data mining techniques. This tool firstly compresses the people flow datasets using UniversalSAX, an extended method of SAX (Symbolic Aggregate Approximation). Next, we apply natural language algorithms to extract movement patterns. Finally, we visualize trajectories of people flow and extracted features to represent popular walking routes and congestions.

Adaptive Blending of Multiple Network Layouts for Overlap-Free Labeling
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation

2016
Conventional force-directed algorithms are known as a common approach to aesthetically drawing networks while they still suffer from self-overlaps especially when the network nodes are annotated with text labels. Incorporating space partitioning techniques including Voronoi tessellation are often effective to spare enough space around each node while this may incur different artifacts such as unexpectedly long edges and edge overlaps. This paper presents an approach to resolving overlaps among node labels by adaptively blending multiple layout forces applied to the respective network nodes. This is accomplished by extending our previous approach for transforming the force-directed layout into that obtained through the centroidal Voronoi tessellation. Our technical contribution lies in a novel algorithm for smoothing blending ratios associated with the network nodes so that we can adaptively explore the reasonable balance between the two layouts independently for each node. Experimental results will present that our new approach can produce well-balanced distribution of node labels while maximally avoiding the aforementioned unwanted visual artifacts.

Tree Visualizations in Structured Data Recursively Defined by the Aleph Data Relation
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
In visualization, tree structures and parent/child data relations are basic. In an earlier article, the author demonstrated how a single tree structure emerged from relational data by recursion, and by the properties of the underlying strings of 0's and 1's of its data symbols. The paper takes a closer look at the components of this visualization to investigate this transformation in greater detail. The unifying factor in this transformation is Mark Burgin's mathematical theory of named sets. Applications of his modeling technique produce a system of models that scales from a basic data relation to a tree structure. The models themselves not only reveal a uniform pattern of data relations hidden in the RDBMS, they give shape and form to the recursive algorithm and to the data structure that organizes relational data into a monolithic tree. Therefore, this system of models represents one component of this novel visualization. The recursive algorithm that operates on these models represents a second. And the third component is the tree structure that this algorithm constructs that is called the open hierarchical data structure (OHDS). In visualization terms, all of three of these components are tightly integrated by the newly discovered data relation. Upon observing its formation, it becomes clear that this data relation represents a specific type of parent/child relation in structured data that is derived from a well-defined SQL SELECT statement. The paper identifies this data relation as the Aleph. In the database, its one-to-one and one-to-many branching patterns are self-similar to the tree structure. Until now, this uniform pattern was concealed within each database table, and in the table linkage of the database system. We conclude that the Aleph data relation is ubiquitous throughout the RDBMS. By the conclusion, the paper demonstrates that its tree visualization is mechanically constructed and recursively defined by the Aleph data relation. The discovery of the Aleph has both practical and theoretical implications that go well beyond visualization research.

Design Tool of Color Schemes on the CIELAB Space
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
Color plays an important role in information visualization. To use the colors as visual representations of the data effectively, designing color schemes that consider perceptual differences between colors is necessary. We developed a tool to assist in color-scheme design when using the CIE1976L*a*b* (or CIELAB) color space. The developed tool provides functions to assist in designing color schemes for nominal, ordinal, and quantitative data. The CIELAB color space has a property in which the Euclidean distances between any two colors in the space can approximate the perceptual differences between them. Thus, designing color schemes for data representation is convenient. However, because the CIELAB color space has a distorted shape, color scheme design in such space is not easy. Our tool allows the designer to see the positions of colors in the CIELAB color space visually to facilitate scheme design. Moreover, our tool provides information to the designer on the distinguishability of the selected colors, and offers functions to correct color schemes automatically.

Native Cross-Platform Visualization: A Proof of Concept Based on the Unity3D Game Engine

2016
Today many different devices and operating systems can be used for InfoVis systems. On the one hand, web-based visualizations can be used to be compatible with several systems, but the performance depends on optimized browser engines. On the other hand, it is possible to build a native system which supports all the benefits for just one device. However, transferring the code to another system means parts of the code or the programming language have to be adapted. To close this gap, we present a proof of concept based on the Unity3D game engine. We implemented a prototype following the InfoVis reference model and basic interactions for interactive data exploration. A major advantage is that we have now the ability to deploy native code to over 20 different devices. Additionally, this proof of concept opens new possibilities for a future InfoVis framework which benefits from Unity3D.

In this paper, we discuss and evaluate the handling of uncertainty in visual network analysis, i.e. the uncertainty of edge attributes. This can be useful to answer a question like &#x201D;How reliable is a flow rate value on a specific edge/pipeline?&#x201D;. For investigating the most suitable and most intuitive representation of uncertain edge attributes in visual network analysis, we extend the state of the art in uncertain edge visualization. We present and compare four different approaches in a large user study to gain insight into effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction. In our user study, we show that dashed lines are the most promising method in general. But, depending on the task, wavy lines as well as blurred lines can be a better choice in terms of efficiency.

Lyrics Word Clouds

Plenty of songs are composed, written, and releasedevery year being recorded in a variety of databases. Thosedo not only store the audio, but also additional data like theartists' names, the years of release, the lengths of the songs, or number of visits, comments, and remarks of visitors andthe like. However, another important data is the lyrics, i.e., thetextual content which can give insights about the topic, genre, or intention of the musicians. Getting an overview about thetextual content of a song, i.e., the lyrics can become a tediouschallenge since listening to the songs or reading the texts is a timeconsuming task. To support users of song databases we propose a visualization tool that is able to generate word clouds from lyrics. Interaction techniques are incorporated in the tool to give more detailed information about the occurrence of words in a song that finally help to find insights about the genre or to just compare the content very rapidly, for example. Our visualization tool is implemented as a web-based interface, that stores requests, updates the local tool database based on those requests, and finally, provides an interactive visualization for the user.

MetricAttitude is a visualization approach implemented in an environment that provides a mental picture by viewing an object-oriented software by means of polymetric views of classes (i.e., fine-grained). In this paper, we present an extension of MetricAttitude which visualizes a software by levels considering not only its class view but also its package views in terms of nested packages (i.e., coarse-grained). Packages are represented by using visual properties associated to Martin's metrics [15]. The new approach and its supporting visualization environment also allow showing relationships among packages.

Time-Varying Data Visualization Using Clustered Heatmap and Dual Scatterplots
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
Heatmap is one of the effective representations for time-varying data visualization. It may require large display spaces when an input dataset contains large number of data items or time steps. We may often want mechanisms to interactively filter non-important data items or time steps, so that we can form appropriate sizes of heatmaps and focus on important data items or time steps. This paper presents a heatmap-based time-varying data visualization technique featuring an interactive mechanism to display meaningful data items and time steps. This technique firstly calculates distances between arbitrary pairs of data items, and constructs a dendrogram consisting the data items. It then generates clusters of the data items and displays the data items belonging to the specified sizes of clusters in the heatmap, so that we can focus on groups of similar or correlated data items. It applies a similar mechanism to a set of time steps so that we can remove outlier time steps from the heatmap. Our implementation features two scatterplots, which represent distribution of data items and time steps respectively, and slider widgets to interactively adjust the thresholds of the clustering process. We can intuitively understand how clusters of data items or time steps are constructed, by looking at the scatterplots while operating the sliders.

Drawing Clustered Graphs Using Stress Majorization and Force-Directed Placements
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
We propose a novel layout algorithm to draw clustered graphs. Our algorithm applies a stress model to draw intra-cluster graphs and a spring-electrical force model to place clusters. Our strategy modifies the original stress model in graph drawing by integrating the force from the center to push and pull the intra-cluster nodes based on their outside connectivity. We also apply the idea of torque equilibrium, coupled with some heuristics, to realize our force-directed placement algorithm. To show the effectiveness of our design, we compare the running time and the number of edge crossings experimentally with the one using full stress majorization as well as other clustered graph drawing algorithms available in the literature. Our experimental results look promising.

A Scatterplot-Based Visualization Tool for Regression Analysis
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
Regression analysis has been widely applied to various academic and industrial fields. Applications of regression analysis include medical problems such as health estimation, environmental problems such as disaster prediction and energy consumption estimation, and business/economic analytics. Here, accuracy and quality of regression analysis strongly depend on relevancy between input explanatory variables and actual objective functions. It often happens that several explanatory variables are well correlated with objective functions while others do not well correlated, and therefore accuracy of regression analysis may improve by removing unnecessary explanatory variables. This paper presents a scatterplot-based regression analysis tool. This tool visualizes the distribution of errors between actual and estimated values of objective functions, and provides user interfaces to explore the relationships between explanatory variables and the errors. This paper introduces examples of the visualization results using the presented tool with actual and estimated revenues at a store.

Smoothed Multiple Binarization -- Using PQR Tree, Smoothing, Feature Vectors and Thresholding for Matrix Reordering
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
Finding appropriate permutations of rows and columns of a matrix may help users to see hidden patterns in datasets. This paper presents a set of binarization-based matrix reordering algorithms able to reveal some patterns in a quantitative data set. In these algorithms, matrix binarization converts a matrix into a set of binary ones, from which the algorithms calculate desired groups of similar rows and columns. PQR trees provide a linear order of rows and columns that obey these groups as much as possible. These algorithms use mean or median filter as smoothing techniques to minimize data noise in intermediate matrix permutation steps. They also use feature vectors or thresholding for defining binarization thresholds in intermediate steps. Our experiments with synthetic matrices revealed that our algorithms are competitive with other matrix reordering algorithms in terms of quality of reordering (Moore stress) and runtime. We observed that our set of algorithms is suitable to reveal Circumplex pattern with all tested noise ratios, and other data canonical patterns with low noise ratio.

Directed graphs are used to represent variety of information, including friendship on social networking services (SNS), pathways of genes, and citations of research papers. Graph drawing is useful to intuitively represent such datasets. This paper presents an edge bundling and a node layout technique for tightly and mutually connected directed graphs. Our edge bundling technique includes three features: ordinary bundling of edges connecting common pairs of node clusters, convergence of multiple bundles connecting to the same node cluster, and shape adjustment of two bundles connecting the same pair of node clusters. This paper includes a case study with a directed paper citation graph.

This paper presents a first step in the realization of an interactive user interface that organizes itself according to the user exploration of a database of cultural heritage objects. The first part makes a brief related works and lays the basis of this kind of system according to the enactive paradigm. The second part explains the mechanisms underlying the selforganization of the interface: keywords and cultural heritage objects are 3D graphical entities endowed with autonomous behaviors. They share a common virtual environment. Keywords behaviors are based on boi&#x0308;ds flocking simulation while cultural heritage objects appears in an virtual museum which evolves and grows progressively. The result that is presented, is an incremental construction of an interactive and realtime 3D metaphor of virtual museum which is then user-specific.

Forensic statements are often unstructured, intricate, and thus difficult to interpret and assess. This is due to the varied nature and format of how interviews with victims, witnesses, or suspects are conducted. It is even more difficult for police investigators, lawyers or other legal practitioners to grasp intuitively and accurately the key information pertaining within the varied statements. This research investigates the opportunities in the convergence of linguistic approaches to extracting and reconstructing the cognitive structure, i.e. "Text-Worlds\

None
2016
This paper describes a sketch based image synthesis method. In this work, image synthesis is treated as a layout generation problem. This method allows users to easily obtain a favorite layout with a simple user operation, sketch drawing. Our method realizes an evolutionary layout generation based on genetic algorithm. First, the target image is given as user strokes. Then, a layout image is generated by pasting sub images that are automatically selected from pre-registered image set. In our approach, the layout image is composed of a base image and the appendant sub images. A base image is probabilistically selected based on roulette wheel selection. The selected base image and the sub images are automatically arranged by the evolutionary generation. We have demonstrated a picture collage application.

Software libraries allow developers to create software projects upon basic functions already implemented. In this way, it is possible to focus on more complex activities to achieve the software solution aims. Software libraries features and availability on the Internet are the reason for these valuable project resources are widely used. However, there may be some issues in software projects that integrate several libraries, since they are independent projects that must work together. This paper presents LibViews, an information visualization application to create visual representations over libraries metrics and usage on software projects. LibViews was developed to provide a better understanding of libraries versions and their role in software projects, helping in the maintenance of these projects identifying previously unknown information. As use case, LibViews was applied in an university corporate software project, pointing out as a useful tool to understand the relationship between software project and its third-party libraries.

2016
Over the past years, visualization of programs has been widely applied. Algorithm animation was proven to aid in teaching and learning. It provides a convenient medium for beginners to a programming language by giving them the ability to visually discover how their programs are running. It also provides experts of a language with a means to have a visual trace utility. Lately, a new approach for adding visualization features into Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) programs was proposed. The new methodology was a dynamic one able to animate different types of algorithms. The work in this paper aims at introducing a revised extension that is able to embed visualization features into Java programs. With the new extension, Java algorithms could be animated without the need of doing any modifications to the code. In addition, the provided technique is still a general one able to animate different kinds of algorithms.

Browsing Multidimensional Visual Entities

2016
The field of Information Visualization seeks to identify the general principles of visualization, and makes use of these principles to propose new forms of visualization for specific types of data. Included in these different data types, it was identified a data type which was not thoroughly explored. The notion of entities where each entity is composed by different attributes, and one of these attributes is composed by one picture which invokes a strong feeling of familiarity to the user. The information that we are attempting to visualize is the most basic type of data structure, a table, where the number of entities to visualize should be higher than we can humanely count, yet smaller than a few thousands. In the field of visualization we identified a niche where the main focus is the image, and despite that it has a vast number of applicable scenarios, it hadn't been properly explored. One of the major attempts at doing so, was by Microsoft Live Labs and it demonstrated limitations that will be addressed by our approach. In order to evaluate the proposed forms of visualization they will be applied and evaluated with the Deloitte Portugal organizational case-study.

The rapid evolution of data generation and storage techniques allowed many organizations to create large databases and store valuable information. These databases are becoming less exploited even when they hide potentially useful knowledge for the organization. The extraction of this buried information inside these voluminous data bases is managed by &#x201C;Data Mining&#x201D;. In this context, many association rules extraction techniques have been developed, but the process of presentation and evaluations is not efficient and has yet to be improved. Therefore, solving these problems let us give a general solution that uses a 3D visualization engine and optimization techniques to reliably display and judge association rules and their belonging to their corresponding classes to give decision makers less room for errors.

Providing insight in complex networks or graphs with multivariate data is one of the main challenges for visual analysis today. Much work has been done for visualizing information on nodes, but the space in between has mostly not been used yet. We developed a user study based on two techniques called Partially filled Bars and Bars of Varying Height and asked subjects to perform different tasks. We briefly present both techniques and our design of a large user study. Our goal is to understand the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches compared to each other. After describing our evaluation setup and our initial hypothesis, the results are analyzed, discussed and the most accepted configuration is presented. Finally we briefly discuss the outcome of the user study and our next steps for further investigations.

While quantified-self applications and wearable sensors for running, cycling or strength training are receiving broad interest from science and industry, little attention has been paid to the increasingly popular climbing sport, so far. To fill this gap, specialized wrist-worn sensor devices for tracking climbers have been developed recently. To support climbers and make the best of the available sensor data use possible, we designed a set of interactive visual interfaces which provide detailed insights into training data and support self-assessments of various aspects of the climbing technique. Our approach consists of a mobile web application to be used during the training and a desktop tool for presentation and analysis. In our design study we conducted semi-structured interviews with climbers, developed a scenario-based prototype in D3.js and evaluated our prototype. The initial interviews, a formative expert review and a summative usability study indicate the importance of providing manual input possibilities in addition to the automatically detected data and visualization techniques showing an overview of their training data. The findings of this design study provide an understanding of how climbers will interact with quantified-self applications and what the individual requirements for such a system are.

Visualization of Music Plagiarism: Analysis and Evaluation

2016
Nowadays plagiarism is an interesting and debated topic in different fields. In music, the plagiarism is a very common phenomenon which touch the vast amounts of money that music melodies are able to generate in today's pop music market. In a music composition, the melody is assumed to be the most significant factor in a court's decision about whether a new music composition is an illegitimate version of a pre-existing composition. Despite the wide-spread belief that there is a fixed and trivial number of corresponding notes between two melodies, the similarity analysis is a very complex process. In this paper we address the plagiarism in pop music, and specifically, we study whether visualization can facilitate the task of discovering melodic similarities among musical songs. To investigate this, we defined three representations to show the melodic relations among songs. We performed a user study in which subjects performed different tasks on a song collection using these representations to investigate which one is best in terms of intuitiveness and accuracy. Results of the study provided us with positive feedback as well as further directions to explore.

Evaluation of Sketchiness as a Visual Variable for 2.5D Treemaps

Treemaps serve as generic, effective tools to display, explore, and analyze multi-variate tree data in a scalable, interactive, and consistent way. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate sketchiness as visual variable of 2.5D treemaps. Sketchy rendering techniques allow us to map data, e.g., about uncertainty, imprecision, or vagueness, independently from mappings to other visual variables such as size, color, and height. To this end, we present a design space for sketchy rendering for 2.5D treemaps and corresponding implementation of a real-time sketchy rendering technique. The results of three user studies carried out indicate that sketchiness is a promising candidate for an independent visual variable for 2.5D treemaps, in particular to map ordinal data with a small range such as data that qualifies map items, it shows no strong interference with other visual variables such as color and height due to the regular gestalt of blocks and, hence, allows us to extend the expressiveness of 2.5D treemaps.

Biometric authentication systems suffer from several performance limitations. Many performance metrics exist to assess the overall performance of such systems. However, these metrics provide a quantitative assessment in terms of errors without explaining the reasons behind the set of users who significantly contributed for these errors. Towards contributing to solve this problem, we present a novel method (named Zoo Graph) to visualize the performance of a biometric system as a graph thanks to a database of recognition scores. Our approach is an improvement of the Zoo Plot and emphasizes on the relations between the individuals of the database and allows interactive manipulations to track these relations and understand why the biometric authentication method reacts this way. This graph provides researchers with an additional visual assessment tool that would identify problematic users. Such information would allow researchers to update their developed authentication algorithms to reduce those errors.

Audio information plays a key role in the learning environment. The effectiveness of audio information on note-taking and learning performance was examined using survey data from a fully online course. First, metrics of note-taking activities were measured using the relationships between these lexical features, and their contributions to learning performance were then examined. In particular, the effectiveness of learning materials presented as slide contents or audio information was compared. Second, some relationships between these metrics and the scores of learning performance evaluations were analysed, and the effectiveness of audio information was qualified using regression analysis. The results indicate that audio information significantly affects both the contents of notes taken and learning performance.

Visualizations became essential to understand large datasets and abstract information. Data Visualizations are increasingly used to tell compelling stories, particularly in journalism. In order to engage the users with complex data, interaction techniques are incorporated into storytelling, emerging narrative visualization. Narrative visualization attempts not only to present information with context, but also to allow users to explore the dataset, find patterns or structures in the data, providing the users with control over the insights she/he gains from interaction. Interaction techniques play a key role in narrative visualization improving understanding of the data and stimulating insights through discovery. In this paper, we explore the benefits of adding interaction techniques to data visualization. Drawing on case studies from Portuguese news media, we identified strategies to enhance storytelling in visualizations and to provide better insights through different types of interactivity.

An Interactive Interface for Multi-dimensional Data Stream Analysis

Data mining models are frequently used to represent and summarize meaningful properties in data. However such models are usually not suitable for interactive data exploration and visualization. This paper proposes the use of multidimensional projection together with the Ubiquitous Self-Organizing Map algorithm (UbiSOM), a novel variant of the well-known self-organizing map algorithm that was specifically tuned for stream data-mining. The resulting high-dimensional projection system is then studied for interactive data analysis and visualization. A prototype was developed where, at each moment, the user can visualize the information from different perspectives. Direct interaction with the system during stream processing is possible both by changing the projection, by optimizing the projection view for maximizing variance or by filtering the incoming data series. Experiments in two distinct datasets show the importance and relevance of conjoining multidimensional data projection with UbiSOM.

In this paper, we propose visual interface and interaction designs for self-ordering systems such as in conveyor belt sushi restaurants. We try to design an interaction in which all people can order foods from their seats at a time without touching any devices, but with a three-dimensions motion sensor, Leap Motion Controller. We design three kinds of interactions and have an experiment to compare them. As a result, it is hard to decide which interaction is best because of false recognition by Leap Motion Controller. However, we found a possibility of interaction for using a three-dimensions motion sensor. We discuss the result of the experiment in detail.

As they are interconnected, location and routing should be addressed simultaneously. The integrated view has been addressed in the literature from a modeling and solution approach perspective, however, lack of comprehensive visualization solutions to help the decision-making process may hinder their real-world applicability. Although this work focuses on a specific application, the tool presented herein can support other real-world location-routing applications (e.g. in logistics). It enables interactive visualizations and navigation in web browsers, and provides functionalities considered important in the context of tourist trip planning. Focus group and usability evaluation were used throughout the development of the tool for collecting information and testing visualizations and interactions.

Development View and Cut Generation of 3D Object Surface for Simulating Haptic Feedback with 2D Lateral Force
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation

2016
We have developed a haptic visualization system for molecular docking applications in education. Although molecular docking is a 3D phenomenon, desktop or laptop PCs require a mouse as a common interface, which limits manipulations to 2D. Our system applies 2D lateral forces to haptic feedback using the SPIDAR-mouse and maps the surface of a 3D object to the 2D plane. The SPIDAR-mouse is a simple haptic device with 2D lateral forces, which is considered suitable for educational environments. In this paper, we discuss the haptic visualization techniques using 2D development view and a processing method for generating cuts on the 3D object surface for a prototype of our system. Our visualization system enables users to intuitively interact with a 3D object using 2D lateral force feedback.

Rainbow Boxes: A Technique for Visualizing Overlapping Sets and an Application to the Comparison of Drugs Properties
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
Overlapping set visualization is a well-known problem in information visualization. This problem considers elements and sets containing all or part of the elements, a given element possibly belonging to more than one set. A typical example is the properties of the 20 amino-acids. A more complex application is the visual comparison of the contraindications or the adverse effects of several similar drugs. The knowledge involved is voluminous, each drug has many contraindications and adverse effects, some of them are shared with other drugs. In this paper, we present rainbow boxes, a novel technique for visualizing overlapping sets, and its application to the properties of amino-acids and to the comparison of drug properties. We also describe a user study comparing rainbow boxes to tables and showing that the former allowed physicians to find information significantly faster. We finally discuss the limits and the perspectives of rainbow boxes.

We argue that exploratory visual analytics frameworks are needed for efficient big data research and datadriven research, and exemplify with experiences from our research. Such frameworks can be used for iterative hypothesis generation and hypothesis verification, and for exploratory creation of appropriate explanatory variables to use in data acquisition and analysis. We discuss how complex analysis tools, e.g. data mining tools, can be integrated with the coordinated multiple views framework and we briefly present a framework that can support such extended coordinated multiple views frameworks and that can be used for &#x201C;open science&#x201D;, i.e. making scientific research, methods, data, etc. reusable and more accessible to everyone.

Support Citizens in Visualising Open Data

2016
This paper contributes in the field of Open Data and their visualisations, trying to reduce the gap between the public institutions (who publish Open Data) and citizens, providing awareness of data quality and supporting them during the process of chart creation. Proposed solution syntactically analyses the dataset's values to infer its data types and continually shows a list of chart visualisations compatible with the selected dataset and its fields. Instead to start with a catalogue containing all available charts, the system reduces the space of charts proposing any time only those that are compatible. In addition, a well-known barrier in the use of Open Data is the poor quality of the available datasets, thus, this paper proposes two quality indexes to provide at glance awareness of the dataset quality. This provides a quantitative measurement to dataset publishers (e.g., public institutions), who can evaluate the data quality, and also the citizens, who can ask for better open datasets providing a reason for such request.

Water is one of the main resources of nature, being the element directly related with maintenance of life in any ecosystem. For mankind, beside the biologic needs, water is used in many sectors of society, and one of them is electricity generation. For the full operation of hydroelectric power plants there is a need to create a huge water reservoir, which transforms the ecosystem and local economy, serving multiple uses, such as tourism, fishing, recreation, sailing, among others. The maintenance in this context is dependent of the quality of water in reservoir, which justifies its continuous monitoring. From the monitored data, it is possible to predict or classify the hydrologic cycle for the reservoir, aiming to support the process of decision about the hydric resources and environmental impact. Thus, this paper presents a practical approach to use visualization techniques based on the PRISMA software, which is a visualization tool with features of multiples views and coordinated databases to identify patterns in hydrologic cycles, considering the psycho-chemical elements existent in the dam water of the hydroelectric power plant from Tucurui&#x0301; - Para&#x0301; - Brazil.

Word-Clouds in the Sky: Multi-layer Spatio-Temporal Event Visualization from a Geo-Parsed Microblog Stream
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
Various events, such as public gatherings, traffic accidents, and natural disasters, occur every day in mega-cities. Although understanding such ever-changing events over all these cities is important for urban planning, traffic management, and disaster response, this is quite a huge challenge. This paper proposes a method of visualizing spatio-temporal events with a multi-layered geo-locational word-cloud representation from a geo-parsed microblog stream. Real-time geo-parsing first geo-locates posts in the stream, using geo-tags and mentioned places and facilities as clues. Temporal local events are then identified and represented by a set of words specifically observed in a certain location and time grid, and then displayed above a map as word-clouds. We detect the locality of events to split them into multiple layers to avoid occlusions between local (e.g., music concerts) and global (e.g., earthquakes and marathon races) events. Users can thereby distinguish local from global events, and see their interactions over the layered maps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to real events extracted from our archive accumulated from five years of Twitter posts.

In this paper, we develop a visualization tool that applies unsupervised named entity recognition and streamgraphs in order to visualize massive amounts of unstructured textual stream data, namely, French newspapers (e.g. Le Figaro, La presse, L'humanite&#x0301;) from the first world war period. Such a visualization allows us to identify main characters, events and locations involved in or relevant to the first world war, according to the French press. Furthermore, our visualization technique can help visually identify correlations between major people (e.g. presidents, generals, public figures...), locations (e.g. countries, cities, towns...) and organizations and events (e.g. corporations, battles...) on multiple aligned streamgraphs. We discuss the streamgraph method and compare it to alternative methods while drawing some examples from the visualization of the first world war. Our method helps users identify named entities and visualise them highlighting significant ones at specific time periods. Furthermore, it can be applied to unstructured data streams of any domain or time period.

Contemporary media art has experienced very dynamic changes in the forms of its artistic expression, as well as in the perception of artworks by the audience and even art theoreticians. Questions about this new art form range from topics such as the unconventional nature of the elements constituting the artwork (program code, audience participation etc.), and the difficulties of displaying and preserving non-material art, to its proper place in the artistic landscape from the viewpoint of contemporary visual art. This paper aims to discuss the abovementioned questions through several case studies of various Latvian digital and contemporary media art areas.

PoI Awareness, Relevance and Aggregation for Augmented Reality
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
The integration of sensors in smartphones and tablets is enabling the emergence of augmented reality (AR) applications for these devices. However, the image captured and the superimposed information is limited to the camera's field-of-view and, in the visualization of points of interest (PoI), symbol overlapping may occur because there is no control over their number and location. Thus, we developed an Android prototype application that aims to: provide better environment awareness using clues to off-screen objects and a 2D map with a radar view, reduce symbol overlapping via aggregation visualizations, and guide the attention of the user by featuring different levels of symbol relevance according to user preferences. An empirical study with search tasks revealed participants preferred having all techniques active instead of none or only some of them. This suggests there is value in combining visualization techniques to address mobile AR challenges, and, possibly, that there is still space to integrate more techniques without overloading the users.

2016
Designers are motivated to the collaboration during professional practice and throughout college graduation years. However, during postgraduation in Design, students start having research work and, usually, a learning of theoretical subjects only through personal scope. With the goal of suggesting changes to such practice methodologies, this study aims to draw attention to a significant learning of theoretical classes in Design postgraduation, through visual thinking and collaboration principles. For such deed, it's being proposed as a didactic strategy the use of Graphic Representations for Synthesis (GRS) produced in groups within the classroom. This work presents a qualitative study, in which the production process, analysis and discussion of GRS developed collaboratively by students during the classes of UCD was investigated. Results have shown that the uses of GRS have supported students' learning and, the insertion of the surprise elements in the production of the GRS have brought substantial gains in this process.

A Multi-level Visualization Scheme for Poetry
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
This article introduces a multi-level visualization scheme for poetry. In each level, different elements are represented and their attributes are coded in different ways. The first level displays the phonemes in a verse, tracing them back to the written word. The second level shows the poem itself in a metric grid where the verse syllables are placed. The third level shows a set of poems whose verses and syllables can be visually compared. Finally, the fourth level is capable of showing hundreds or thousands of verses at once, turning each verse into a tile whose color indicates a meaningful property. We argue that each level has its strengths and its weaknesses and we evaluate them with our collaborators from the poetry community.

Using Micro-Visualisations to Support Faceted Filtering of Recommender Results

2016
Faceted search is a well known and broadly implemented paradigm for filtering information with various types of structured information. In this paper we introduce a multiple-view faceted interface, consisting of one main visualisation for exploring the data and multiple miniaturised visualisations showing the filters. The Recommendation Dashboard tool provides several interactive visualisations for analysing recommender results along various faceted dimensions specific to cultural heritage and scientific content. As our aim is to reduce the user load and optimise the use of screen area, we permit only one main visualisation to be visible at a time, and introduce the concept of micro-visualisations -- small, simplified views conveying only the necessary information -- to provide natural, easy to understand representation of the the active filter set.

Interactive Text Visualization with Text Variation Explorer

Digitalization is changing how research is carried out in all areas of science. Humanities is no exception - materials that used to be hand-written or printed on paper are increasingly available in digital form. This development is changing how scholars are interacting with their material. We are addressing the problem of interactive text visualization in the context of sociolinguistic language study. When a scholar is reading and analyzing text from a computer screen instead of a paper, we can support this by providing a dashboard for reading, and by creating visualizations of the text structure, variation, and change. We have designed and developed a software tool called Text Variation Explorer (TVE) for sociolinguistic language study. It is based on interactive visualization with a direct manipulation user interface, and aimed for exploratory corpus linguistics. The TVE software tool has proven to be useful in supporting the study of language variation and change in its social contexts, or sociolinguistics. It is, to a certain degree, language-independent, and generic enough to be useful in other linguistic contexts as well. We are now in the process of designing and implementing the next iteration of TVE. We present the lessons learned from the first version, discuss the old and the new design, and welcome feedback from the communities involved.

A Threshold Structure Metric for Medical Image Interrogation: The 2D Extension of Approximate Entropy
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation

2016
Reconstructive imaging permeates medical practice because of its apparently clear grey-scale depiction of anatomy. However, the tell tale signs of abnormality and its delineation for treatment demand experts work at the threshold of visibility for hints of structure. Hitherto, a suitable assistive metric that chimes with clinical experience has been absent. This paper develops the complexity measure approximate entropy (ApEn) from its one-dimensional physiological origin into a two-dimensional algorithm to fill this gap. The first detailed algorithm is presented and then applied to X-ray computed tomography used in image guided radiotherapy for cancer. Results clearly reveal the fine structural detail missed by grey-scale metrics, the strength of which is calibrated by the ApEn process itself. Machine assisted manual interaction and automated image interrogation for radiomics is envisaged.

Visualization of sRNA-mRNA Interaction Predictions
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
The central dogma in molecular biology postulated that 'DNA makes RNA makes protein', however this dogma has been recently extended to integrate new biological activities involving small non-coding RNAs, called sRNAs. In particular, it has been shown that sRNAs regulate the production of proteins by interacting on mRNAs to regulate positively or negatively their translations. That regulation of the mRNA translation is done by forming a base-pairing between the RNAs sequences of bases. In silico methods have been proposed by the bioinformatics community toprovide a list of putative interactions to be experimentally validated. However, such approaches suffers from a poor specificity and therefore produce a large number of false predictions. In this paper, we present a new visualization technique for sRNA-mRNA interactions emphasizing theinvolved regions on the sRNA secondary structure drawing. Our approach also supports interactive exploration as the user can select and highlight interactions. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by a case study on E. coli bacteria performed by domain experts.

The visualization approach presented here supports the analyst in finding genes with high similarity or dissimilarity across different experimental groups. By using an external overview in combination with filter windows, and various color scales for showing the degree of similarity, our interactive visual prototype is able to intuitively guide the exploration processes over the large amount of gene expression data.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has transformed genomic research by decreasing the cost of sequencing and increasing the throughput. Today the translation of NGS technology to (cancer) diagnostics and therapeutics is widely anticipated. In this paper we give an overview of design, user experience and usability (DUXU) requirements for NGS applications with a special focus on clinical and diagnostic settings and describe a data driven GUI and visualization framework for a NGS based clinical decision support system (DSS). In such a DSS it is hard to oversee the huge amount of information, especially if given only in textual form. To overcome this we developed a visual language for electronic health records (EHR) for navigation within a case and comparison of medical cases.

In comparison to existing electronic scanners biopsy slides analysis using microscopes is considered as most viable approach in the pathology laboratory to perform routine examination and to determine the actual condition of human ovarian reproductive tissues. An expert needs longer processing time during manual microscopic analysis and there is inconsistent result among experts. A suitable computerized approach may be a more viable option to overcome the issues associated with manual approach. In this paper different types of images acquired from different biopsy slides were incorporated for a comprehensive review and analysis purpose. A new modified approach has been presented in this study which can reduce processing time and indicates improved accuracy. Comparative results indicate that type P63 non-counter stained performs better identification result.

Many authors have used this technique for different issues, for example for image interpolation and reconstruction, for structure-adaptive anisotropic filtering and inpainting based on image characteristics. Here we make use of this procedure and extend previous studies to present an inpainting new algorithm. To validate our study we present some numerical applications to grey scale images with complex geometries.

Large displays are one of the core components of visualizing large-scale data sets, allowing users to render a larger amount of information and present it in the corresponding context. However, these displays still have many disadvantages, like the high costs that increase exponentially with display size and the immobility of the display setups. In this paper, we introduce a virtual large screen that is designed as an alternative to physical large displays. It is implemented with the help of the Oculus Rift head mounted display (HMD). Users wearing the virtual glasses are able to see and explore a virtual screen and make use of its size advantages without the cost and location restrictions of the physical counterpart. A preliminary evaluation of our system suggests that the users' perception and cognitive abilities are similar for both working on large physical displays and our large virtual screens.

Effects of Very High Frame Rate Display in Narrative CGI Animation
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation

2016
Screen resolution of digital images and digital displays has increased steadily over the last several decades, but there has been comparatively little interest in a parallel increase in temporal resolution, or frame rate. Several groups are experimenting with High Frame Rate (HFR) for live-action cinema, but they do not address the issue with respect to synthetic images (CGI) in animation, nor do they take advantage of the repeatability of synthetic image sequences to study visual differentiation of HFR sequences run at different frame rates. This study is concerned with analyzing animated motion pictures that are created and viewed at very high frame rates, 120 frames-per-second (fps) and higher. To explore these issues we employ high frequency procedural motion data to create repeatable animated sequences at different frame rates while maintaining exact control over action and point of view as well as over techniques of photorealism such as motion blur and camera shutter effects. Holding these factors constant allows us to better understand how the same cinematic narrative is perceived at different frame rates. Our work in this area is just beginning.

Temporal Data Visualization Technique Based on Treemap
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
Many information visualization techniques and tools have been created to analyze and understand temporal data. However, it is noticeable that time dimension is underused in most techniques and tools, used only as an aid in the search for patterns and answers. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptation of the treemap joined with the calendar metaphor, using time as main attribute to hierarchy configuration and drill down navigation. Time granularity is flexible on granularity levels, and a grouping configuration of one level is used to display the calendar visual representation of that same granularity level. Furthermore, user interaction breadcrumbs are applied in order to provide better linear analysis of temporal characteristics of data without losing data overview. It is also possible to compare multiple different views of various time subsets.

2016
While the touch screens on mobile devices have penetrated and touched the lifestyle of millions of people, few have realized its potentials and sustainabilities at their finger tips. Resistive or capacitive touch screens are perfect surfaces for artistic expressions such as drawing and painting, all can be accomplished by a fine touch with only one finger, anytime, anywhere, any size. Be it discrete, continuous or compound touch, a discriminative touch is a direct haptic I/O between the human and the device with the touch screen as the surface, finger as the tool and digital palette as the medium. The author had previously used the PC mouse as a tool on the laptop, has explored and investigated the immense possibilities of achieving the same or even better results with the finger on touch screens between mid-2012 to the present on Android smartphone and tablet. This paper demonstrates the articulation and results of freehand finger interaction on drawing and painting any subject matters, from the abstract to the super realistic. It dispels the need of the conventional inapt image editor software with bloated painting tools and use of a stylus pen as a painting vehicle.

We propose a novel calculation method of personality based on the Chinese physiognomy. The proposed solution combines the ancient and the modem physiognomy to summarize the corresponding relation between the personality and facial feature and model the baseline to shape the face feature. We compute histogram of image by searching for the threshold values to create a binary image in an adaptive way. The two-pass connected component method indicates the feature region. We encode the binary image to remove the noise point, so that the new connected image can provide a better result. The method was tested on ORL face database.

New Paradigm of Social Poster Embedding Unexpected Graphic Pattern for the Ongoing Issue, Radiation Contamination in Fukushima
2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2016
A poster must be sufficiently informative to convey a suitable message which reflects the genuine characteristics of the topic. A social poster design deals with social issues, which are not instantaneous events where existing in a dynamic society. Therefore, the social poster design has to represent the continuous consequences due to the social incident. On 11 March in 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake hit off the east coast of Japan, caused 15,821 deaths, 3,962 missing, and 5,940 injuries in 20 Japanese prefectures as reported by The National Police Agency of Japan (Dunbar et al., 2011). Though the earthquake, aftershocks and tsunamis ended, it is an unfinished tragedy, due to the continuous exposure of the radioactive contaminated water by the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The highly contaminated water has accumulated on roofs and it keeps flowed into the Pacific Ocean when it rains (McCurry, 2015). This study aims to present the ongoing impact of radioactive materials to our society on a social poster through an animated graphic. The randomly created background patterns within the poster, symbolize the unfinished radioactive leaking and its circulation in our environment. Hence, this poster is a dynamically changing rather than a static graphic poster, much like the continuous changes occurring within the environment, due to the Fukushima event. In the middle, the red solid circle not only reflects the Japanese flag but also symbolizes the contaminated Earth. For the background patterns, I generated the random motion of oblique lines by computer programming using Processing, which is an open source programming language. The randomly generated graphic by Processing, referred to as animated graphic, exhibits the unexpected radioactive exposures due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The red circle represented Japan and the Earth suffered by the ongoing contamination that it was depicted by transparent red that the symbol and the patterns are overlapped and coexist. It should be noted that the printed version of the poster is captured from the digital work, which can be found at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ulcosh5dpm1xw85/index.html?dl=0. The animated graphic shown in the dynamic poster, informs an audience of the ongoing social issue that the radioactivity which has been leaking into the ocean since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. Unlike a traditional, static print poster, it raises the audiences' awareness, empathy and understanding of the tragedy using dynamic data, affecting a different reaction.

A Visual Analytics Approach for Word Relevances in Multiple Texts
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
We investigate the problem of analyzing word frequencies in multiple text sources with the aim to give an overview of word-based similarities in several texts as a starting point for further analysis. To reach this goal, we designed a visual analytics approach composed of typical stages and processes, combining algorithmic analysis, visualization techniques, the human users with their perceptual abilities, as well as interaction methods for both the data analysis and the visualization component. By our algorithmic analysis, we first generate a multivariate dataset where words build the cases and the individual text sources the attributes. Real-valued relevances express the significances of each word in each of the text sources. From the visualization perspective, we describe how this multivariate dataset can be visualized to generate, confirm, rebuild, refine, or reject hypotheses with the goal to derive meaning, knowledge, and insights from several text sources. We discuss benefits and drawbacks of the visualization approaches when analyzing word relevances in multiple texts.

MetricAttitude [18] is a visualization approach implemented in an environment that provides a mental picture of an object-oriented software by means of polymetric views of classes. In this paper, we describe a qualitative investigation we have conducted with a focus group involving developers aiming at evaluating their viewpoint on the relevance of the support MetricAttitude provides to perform comprehension tasks on source code. This investigation also allowed us to gather information on the developers' opinion on the MetricAttitude features and its software visualization metaphors. The discussion was animated and participants provided a number of useful suggestions for improving the visualization. The tool was considered very useful, while some usability problems have to be addressed. Specifically, the information provided has to be further filtered to easier software comprehension tasks.

Whether the Relationscape of Interaction Design Strategies During Design Process Can Be Explained by Linkography
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation

2017
There are a mass of design decisions within the design process, including the reasoning of design and the evolution of the conception, or undiscovered relevance between sketches/diagrams. If we don't realize the process of design by analysis of results further, the designer will not learn from experience and will not avoid the same mistake. This study through diagram following the linkography method, the critical decision CM (critical moves) will be revealed. By calculating the design process unit CM proportion of the number, the most important moves form a particularly large number of links. The CM can show the main idea of direction of subject, therefore, via CM, designers can understand what's the weakness of themselves and extending their knowledge, getting rid of the traditional thinking mod.

Identifying the Relationships Between the Visualization Context and Representation Components to Enable Recommendations for Designing New Visualizations
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
In this paper we address the question of the relationships between visualization challenges and the representation components that provide solutions to these challenges. Our approach involves extracting such relationships through an identification of the context and the components of a significant number of representations and a comparison of the result to existing theoretical studies. To make such an identification possible, we rely on a characterization of the representation context based on a thoughtful aggregation of existing characterizations of the data type, the tasks and the context of use of the representations. We illustrate our approach on a use-case with examples of a relationships extraction and of a comparison of that relationships to the theory. We believe that the establishment of such relationships makes it possible to understand the mechanisms behind the representations, in order to build a representation design recommendation tool. Such a tool will enable us to recommend the components to use in a representation, given a visualization challenge to address.

The Role of Perspective Cues in RSVP
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
Riffling the pages of a book, perhaps in the search for a specific image, is an example of Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP). Even at a pace of 10 images per second, successful search is often possible. Interest in RSVP arises because a digital embodiment of RSVP has many applications.There are many possible 'modes' of RSVP. However, a mode can be especially helpful if, after the appearance of an image, and without delaying the arrival of other images, it can remain in view for a second or two to allow a user to confirm that a desired image has been found. Moreover, if a collection of images is presented in such a way as to be perceived as moving in 3D space, it is thought that the search for an individual image can thereby be enhanced by comparison with a 2D presentation.To test this conjecture we devise and use the "Deep-Flat" visual illusion whereby a column of moving images magnifying in size is perceived as approaching the viewer as in a 3D space. When the images are presented in an equivalent way horizontally as a row, the viewer tends to see this as images growing in size, but now on a flat (2D) plane. We tested comparable RSVP designs in these two illusions to ascertain the relative effects of 2D and 3D style presentation under precisely controlled conditions. Elicited data included both performance measures (e.g., recognition success), and user preferences and opinions.We established the effectiveness of RSVP using the illusion. When tested under directly comparable conditions, we concluded that performance is not significantly affected by the illusion of depth, but that the inclusion of certain background cues can have a significantly detrimental effect on performance.

QueryCrumbs: A Compact Visualization for Navigating the Search Query History

2017
Models of human information seeking reveal that search, in particular ad-hoc retrieval, is non-linear and iterative. Despite these findings, todays search user interfaces do not support non-linear navigation, like for example backtracking in time. In this work, we propose QueryCrumbs, a compact and easy-to-understand visualization for navigating the search query history supporting iterative query refinement. We apply a multi-layered interface design to support novices and firsttime users as well as intermediate users. The formative evaluation with first-time and intermediate users showed that the interactions can be easily performed, and the visual encodings were well understood without instructions. Results indicate that QueryCrumbs can support users when searching for information in an iterative manner.

Visualization Techniques for the Comparative Analysis of Weighted Free Trees
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
A weighted free tree is an undirected connected graph with no cycles whose edges and nodes have weights (positive real numbers). The purpose of our research is to support the comparative analysis of weighted free trees. The fundamental categories of visualization techniques that support comparison are juxtaposition, superposition, and explicit encoding. Juxtaposition is often used for comparison. However, the cognitive load required to grasp a difference is large. Superposition is effective for recognizing a difference, but select information may be difficult to observe. Explicit encoding is an effective technique specialized in a specific task, but representation switching may occur frequently during analysis. Hence, there is the risk of destructing a viewer's mental map, which reduces work efficiency. We divide the working process of analysis into 14 tasks and develop four visualization techniques that can continually perform these tasks. Moreover, we conduct an experiment to investigate whether our proposed techniques are able to perform these tasks. We confirm that these tasks can be performed efficiently by applying our techniques to a case study that compares two trees.

A Technique for Ranking and Visualization of Crowd-Powered Subjective Evaluations
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
We previously presented a crowd-powered digital contents evaluation system. This system shows a lot of pictures to the answerers and ask them to input the evaluations. It preferentially selects pictures which are predicted to be highly or poorly evaluated to the answerers, based on our assumption that high or poor evaluations are more informative results comparing with moderate evaluations. We have applied an interactive genetic algorithm in our system to select such pictures. This paper presents a technique for ranking and visualization for the evaluation results collected by our system. The presented technique calculates scores of all contents and uses for the ranking. Here, it may happen that some pictures are shown to no answerers while using our evaluation system. Our technique presented in this paper estimates the evaluation of such pictures shown to no answerers, and finally complete the ranking of all the pictures. The paper also presents the visualization tool for the ranking of pictures, and our experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.

Heatmap visualization is a well-known type of visualization to alleviate the overplot problem of point visualization. As such, it is well suited to visualize Big Data. In order to tackle the velocity problem of Big Data, one has to leverage streaming computations. Recently, canopy clustering was shown to be well suited for Big Data heatmap visualization. In this article, we present how to design a streaming algorithm to compute canopy clustering using Apache Spark. This result is directly applicable to be included into a lambda architecture.

Visual-Interactive k-NDN Method (VIK): A Novel Approach to Visualize and Interact with Content-Based Image Retrieval Systems Regarding Similarity and Diversity
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
Digital imaging plays an important role in many human activities, such as agriculture and forest management, earth sciences, urban planning, weather forecasting, medical imaging and so on. Processing, exploring and visualizing the inconceivable volumes of such images has turned out to be progressively troublesome. The Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) remains an important issue that finds potential applications, given the place that retrieving digital images similar to a user-defined specification or pattern in huge databases now occupies in the day-to-day. CBIR systems use visual information like color, shape and texture to represent images in feature vectors. In general, there is an inconsistency in the evaluation of similarity between images according to human perception and the results computed by CBIR systems, which is called Semantic Gap. One way to improve CBIR systems is by the addition of techniques to visualize and interact with CBIR regarding similarity and diversity criteria, where the user can participate more actively in the process and steer the results according to its needs. In this paper we present the Visual-Interactive k-NDN Method (ViK): a novel approach to visualize and interact with Content-Based Image Retrieval systems. This paper aims at making use of Visual Data Mining techniques applied to queries in CBIR systems, improving the interpretability of the measure of diversity, applied using fractal analysis, as well as the relevance of results according to the prior knowledge of the user. Therefore, the user takes an active role in the content-based image retrieval, guiding its result and, consequently, reducing the Semantic Gap. Additionally, a better understanding of the diversity and similarity factors involved in the query is supported by visualization and interaction techniques.

We have previously presented a visualization technique which represents multi-dimensional data as collection of low-dimensional parallel coordinate plots. This paper presents a general-purpose extension of the visualization technique which represents multi-dimensional data as a combination of the scatterplots with parallel coordinate plots. We aim to automatically select a small number of pairs of variables which are estimated that they bring interesting visualization by scatterplots. This paper also presents an application of this visualization technique to Multi-objective optimization of manufacturing design. Our multi-dimensional data visualization technique effectively assists us to understand the distribution and correlation of design variables and objective functions in multi-objective optimization processes.

Visual analytics plays a key role in bringing insights to audiences who are interested and dedicated in data exploration. In the area of relational data, many advanced visualization tools and frameworks are proposed in order to dealing with such data features. However, the majority of those have not greatly considered the whole process from data-model mining to query utilizing on dimensions and data values, which might cause interruption to exploration activities. This paper presents a new interactive exploration framework for relational data analysis through automatic interconnection of data models, data dimensions and data values. The basic idea is to construct a relative and switchable chain of those context representations by integrating our previous techniques on node-link, parallel coordinate and scatterplot graphics. This approach enables users to flexibly make relative queries on desired contexts at any stage of exploration for deep data understanding. The result from a typical case study for the framework demonstration indicates that our approach is able to handle the addressed challenge.

A Visual Representation of Clusters Characteristics Using Edge Bundling for Parallel Coordinates
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation

2017
This paper proposes an edge bundling approach applied on parallel coordinates to improve the visualization of cluster information directly from the overview. Lines belonging to a cluster are bundled into a single curve between axes, where the horizontal and vertical positioning of the bundling intersection (known as bundling control points) to encode pertinent information about the cluster in a given dimension, such as variance, standard deviation, mean, median, and so on. The hypothesis is that adding this information to the overview improves the visualization overview at the same that it does not prejudice the understanding in other aspects. We have performed tests with participants to compare our approach with classic parallel coordinates and other consolidated bundling technique. The results showed most of the initially proposed hypotheses to be confirmed at the end of the study, as the tasks were performed successfully in the majority of tasks maintaining a low response time in average, as well as having more aesthetic pleasing according to participants' opinion.

Evaluation of Biometric Authentication Systems through Visualisation of Partitioned and Bundled Power-Graphs
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
Biometric authentication systems verify the identity of individuals based on what they are. As they are error prone, they can reject genuine individuals or accept impostors. Researchers of the field quantify the quality of their algorithm by benchmarking it on several databases. However, although the standard evaluation metrics state the performance of their system, they are unable to explain the reasons of their errors. This paper presents a novel way to visualize the evaluation results of a biometric authentication system which helps to find which individuals or samples are sources of errors. This knowledge could help to fix the algorithms. A biometric database of scores is modeled as a partitioned power-graph with nodes representing biometric samples and power-nodes representing individuals. A novel recursive edge bundling method is also applied to reduce clutter. This proposal has been successfully applied on several biometric databases and has proved its efficiency.

Speech and language researchers often rely on large, naturalistic, audio-visual corpora to identify and measure patterns of language structure, variation, change and use. There are, however, few visualization tools designed for this need. This paper proposes a novel visual analytic method to process large linguistic corpora by employing Bayes' Theorem and interactive visualization. We adopt a simple and meaningful design in our visualization for linguists to understand. Instead of offering a fixed visualization, this project enables greater interaction through filtering, grouping and dragging. Multiple phases are included in the system, from processing the metadata exported from popular standalone linguistic software, to creating the visualization, and enabling interaction and filtering.

Visual Debugging of SPH Simulations
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation

2017
Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a popular mesh-free, particle-based fluid simulation approach for a wide range of applications. There are several numerical variants of SPH along with a variety of models for aspects such as boundary conditions, compressibility or incompressibility, and surface tension. Different combinations of these models lead to varying effects that occur during simulation, and their analysis is a critical challenge for fluid mechanics. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a visual debugging application for simulations, which allows users to evaluate the properties of the models and to detect possible computational errors. Our multi-view application uses a combination of interactive 3D visualization of the particles and non-spatial visualizations from the field of information visualization, namely scatter plots and parallel coordinates plots. Our visual debugging environment thus enables a quantitative analysis of the multidimensional simulation attributes, including internal and physical properties contributing to the simulation process. All views support brushing and linking, that is, selections of interesting value ranges in the plots are directly visible in the 3D view and, conversely, the selection of particles in the 3D view highlights the corresponding data points in the plots. Since typical SPH simulations come with large numbers of data points, we employ stochastic subsampling to reduce visual clutter in the non-spatial views and accelerate the rendering speed. We discuss four real-world use cases for visual debugging of fluid simulations that showcase how our visual debugging environment is instrumental for identify code errors and increases the understanding of the simulation models. We also show how the combination of coupled views can reveal internal details, thus serving to improve simulation results.

In this paper, we propose an approach that uses software metrics to comprehend attributes of a codebase: maintainability, reusability, or complexity. This approach is new because it uses gathered metrics as the basis to associate musical sounds to source code classes. These sounds are arranged to compose a melody that can be both visualized (as a musical score) and played. We named this new way to deal with a codebase: software musification. To prove the validity of our proposal, we show a sample of its application. The main goal of this paper is to show our promising idea and to present research achievements at the early stages of our research.

Interaction Visualisation of Complex Genomic Data with Game Engines
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
Graphic game engines have introduced even more advanced technologies to improve the rendering, image quality, ergonomics, and user experience of their creations by providing user-friendly yet powerful tools to design and develop new games. There are thousands of genes in the human genome that contain information about specific individual patients and the biological mechanisms of their diseases. The complexity in biomedical and genomic data usually requires effective visual information processing and analytics. Unfortunately, available visualisation techniques for this domain are limited, many in static forms. The open study questions here are as follow: Are there lessons to be learnt from these video games? Or could the game technology help us explore new graphic ideas accessible to non-specialists?

None
2017
LOOM is advanced as a new visualisation for changes in ranks and trends in power-law data that is changing dynamically over time. A comparison between LOOM and existing methods for visualising such data (e.g., time-series graphs, typical analytics dashboards). Several exemplar data sets are shown, using LOOM, drawn from the tracking of news stories on Twitter. The basis for the LOOM visualisation is elaborated and it is shown how it avoids the pitfalls arising in other line-graph representations.

Temporal Visualization of Energy Consumption Loads Using Time-Tone
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation

2017
Feedback plays an important role in assisting users to better understand their energy consumption behaviour. This is particularly true when users want to change their behaviour in order to reduce their energy consumption, and to manage their usage more effectively so as to avoid putting unnecessary load on energy providers. This paper presents the time-tone visualization, which aims to assist users by displaying variations in energy consumption by different categories of household devices over time, and their respective contributions to the total energy usage load. A user study conducted to compare time-tone against area-charts shows that although the two visualizations are comparable, time-tone is more effective for cases where there are large variations in energy usage loads.

Retrieving information based on the users' preferences and profiles represent a challenging issue to overcome. Moreover, in the public transport field, this task becomes increasingly complex due to the heterogeneous data fetched from various sources. Though, ontologies have emerged in retrieving information field to reduce this complexity. This paper describes a visual framework aiming to search and extract the suitable itinerary that fits better with the user's information needs and based on the ontologies. The framework relies on three main components: a simple search component, an advanced search based on users' preferences and profile component and a Question-Answering search component represented in a natural language. Our framework has been implemented and evaluated.

We investigate the watercolor brush strokes from the perspective of fluid dynamics and the pigments movement within the flowing water. We propose a method to plausibly simulate process of watercolor painting on rough paper including the diffusion effects on graphics processor. We present a method based on 2D fluid simulation using Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the ink diffusion. Intricate details of water flow are preserved by taking into account the vorticity, too.

This paper presents a novel technique for combining 2D and 2.5D treemaps using multi-perspective views to leverage the advantages of both treemap types. It enables a new form of overview+detail visualization for tree-structured data and contributes new concepts for real-time rendering of and interaction with treemaps.

Deciphering Gene Sets Annotations with Ontology Based Visualization
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
Nowadays, one of the main challenges in biology is to make use of several sources of data to improve our understanding of life. When analyzing experimental data, researchers aim at clustering genes that show a similar behavior through specific external conditions. Thus, the functional interpretation of genes is crucial and involves making use of the whole subset of terms that annotate these genes and which can be relatively large and redundant. The manual expertise to clearly decipher the main functions that may be related to the gene set is timeconsuming and becomes impracticable when the number of gene sets increases, like in the case of vaccine/drug trials. To overcome this drawback, it may be necessary to reduce the dataset with the aim to apply visualization approaches. In this paper, we propose a new pipeline combining enrichment and annotation terms simplification to produce a synthetic visualization of several gene sets simultaneously. We illustrate the efficiency of our method on a case study aiming at analyzing the immune response in diseases.

Interactive infographics are a powerful tool to represent and communicate complex information. In datadriven journalism journalists use interactive infographics to explain new insights and facts while telling complex stories on the basis of retrieved data. However, readers of online news are still unexperienced while using interactive infographics. The results of a user survey among readers of online newspapers show how readers use and interact with interactive infographics in online newspapers. To improve the acceptance among users and to identify success factors of their utilization the results of a usability study of interactive infographics are presented.

Automatic Image Annotation (AIA) is a challenging problem in the field of image retrieval, and several methods have been proposed. However, visually supporting this important tasks and reducing the semantic gap between low-level image features and high-level semantic concepts still remains a key issue. In this paper, we propose a visually supporting image annotation framework based on visual features and ontologies. Our framework relies on three main components: (i) extraction and classification of features component, (ii) ontology's building component and (iii) image annotation component. Our goal consists on improving the visual image annotation by:(1) extracting invariant and complex visual features; (2) integrating feature classification results and semantic concepts to build ontology and (3) combining both visual and semantic similarities during the image annotation process.

A Decision Tree Interface Based on Predicate Calculus
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
The paper presents automated relational technology ART Studio that generates end-user decision trees from relational data automatically. End-users navigate down these tree structures to pinpoint information managed by the RDBMS. This decision tree reflects and selfreferences data in the database; it turns the data inside out. To generate this visualization, the Studio models a uniform pattern of data in the RDBMS called the Aleph data relation. Earlier research reports that the Aleph is a mechanically derived parent-child data relationship that is ubiquitous throughout the database. The paper will now argue that the Aleph is a complex mathematical object that is dense and compact. Subsequently, its identity is multifaceted. On the computer, its physical symbols represent both an IF-THEN construct, as well as a rich and expressive predicate that replace the need for creating SQL SELECT commands. To support this claim the author draws on two sources: 1) Codd's view of the relational database as a form of predicate calculus, and 2) the author's nascent theory of meta-symbols. The bridging metaphor between these two ideas is the fact that data symbols can be viewed in linguistic terms as tokens and types. The paper will show how the Alephbased decision tree models database tables and their data. It has a logical correspondence with the tables attributes and tuples. The paper shows how predicates in its pathways map to predicates in Codd's tuple components. This point is made to highlight how Alephbased decision trees project Codd's view of the RDBMS as a form of predicate calculus.

A User Study on Judging the Target Node in Partial Link Drawings

2017
Partially drawn links are a possibility to reduce visual clutter in node-link visualizations of relational data caused by link crossings. Although partial links have some benefits concerning task performance, they exhibit issues regarding target node ambiguities. In this paper, we provide the results of a user study that investigates the performance in terms of task accuracy when judging target nodes to which partial links are pointing. We vary the link lengths and link directions as independent variables and measure the task accuracy as dependent variable while the exposure duration for each stimulus is fixed. The major result of our user study is that people tend to make more target node judgment errors with shorter link lengths. Moreover, the direction of the partial links also has an impact on the accuracy. With these results, we are able to choose appropriate parameter settings for graphs drawn with partial links. This can be regarded as a novel graph drawing criterion for improving the readability of graphs represented with partial links.

Challenging 3D Head Tracking and Evaluation Using Unconstrained Test Data Set

3D face tracking using one monocular camera is an important topic, since it is useful in many domains such as: video surveillance system, human machine interaction, biometrics, etc. In this paper, we propose a new 3D face tracking which is robust to large head rotations. Underlying cascaded regression approach for 2D landmark detection, we build an extension in context of 3D pose tracking. To better work with out-of-plane issues, we extend the training dataset by including a new set of synthetic images. For evaluation, we propose to use a new recording system to capture automatically face pose ground-truth, and create a new test dataset, named U3PT (Unconstrained 3D Pose Tracking). The performance of our method along with the state-of-the-art methods are carried out to analyze advantage as well as limitations need to be improved in the future.

Game development activity using Team-based Learning (TBL) was investigated in order to identify factors contributing to the usability of the product. In this study, three teams from two different countries are compared. As the related factors, the followings were examined to analyze the relationships with usability scores: (1) learning reflection, (2) social media communications within teams, and (3) participants' characteristics and information literacy. Usability scores were conveyed using a System Usability Scale (SUS) by evaluations from the other teams. The participants' characteristics and information literacy were measured before starting the project as a pre-test. The discussions and communications via social media of each group were categorized as: Proposal, Permission, Encouragement, and Acknowledgment, using protocol analysis to examine their contributions towards the usability scores. After completing the study project, a learning reflection questionnaire was completed by all participants to evaluate efficacy, satisfaction and achievement of learning, and difficulties.

Node Overlap Removal for 1D Graph Layout

2017
Energy based algorithms are powerful techniques for laying out graphs. They tend to generate aesthetically pleasing graph embeddings, exhibiting symmetries and community structures. When dealing with large graphs, an important drawback of these algorithms is to produce embeddings where many nodes overlap, leading to cluttering issues. While several approaches have been proposed for node overlap removal on 2D graph layouts, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work dedicated to 1D graph layouts. In this paper, we first define 4 requirements for 1D graph node overlap removal. Then, we propose a O(|V|log(|V|)) time algorithm meeting these requirements. We illustrate our approach with two case studies based on arc diagrams where nodes are positioned by applying a MDS technique to highlight community structures. Finally, we compare our technique with alternatives from 2D graph techniques, and a discussion highlights some properties of the results.

Dynamic Graph Visualization on Different Temporal Granularities
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
Dynamic graphs are typically represented in a time-to-space mapping with the goal to preserve the mental map in order to reduce cognitive efforts for comparison tasks. Such a mapping from time to space has the general drawback that space limitations are sooner reached than in corresponding time-to-time mappings to which graph animation belongs. Consequently, to get an overview about the dynamics in a graph sequence, space-efficient and compact visual encodings are used to show as many graphs in the sequence as possible. Temporal graph aggregation is hence a clever data transformation strategy, but negatively, it does not provide an overview about individual graphs nor does it show graph subsequences on finer time granularities. In this paper we describe a visualization technique that can visualize dynamic graphs in a time-to-space mapping and additionally, allows the graph analyst to interactively explore the dynamic graph data on different temporal granularities. Moreover, if the dynamic graph data is rather dense, it can be filtered by selecting density intervals. We illustrate the usefulness of our visualization tool by applying it to a dynamic graph dataset that simulates time-continuously changing graphs.

Visualization of Open Community Runtime Task Graphs

The emergence of new types of high performance hardware also drives the need for new programming models. The Open Community Runtime (OCR) proposal uses a task-based programming model to target some of these architectures. In OCR, the whole program from start to end needs to be expressed using tasks and synchronized using task-to-task dependences, significantly limiting the applicability and usefulness of existing approaches to application development and debugging. In this paper, we present our approach to visualizing tasks and their synchronization, based on trace data from application execution. This way, the application developer may compare the intended organization of the tasks with the actual dependences as they are seen by the OCR runtime system.

Visualizing Missing Values

Many real world data sets have data items with missing values. Values can be missing for many different reasons, such as sensor failure, respondents forgetting or refusing to answer a question in a survey, or a certain feature not being applicable to certain subsets of data. When visualizing data, some visualizations can easily handle missing values, while for others it is not obvious how to represent them without the resulting visualization being misleading. We give examples of different ways our system for interactive visual exploration of data handles missing data. These examples come from real world big data projects we took part in. Different ways to visualize missing values work well with different visualizations. Coordinated multiple views is a powerful way to visualize data with missing values, and having several views of the data helps explore the properties of the items with missing values.

Humans are vulnerable to cognitive biases such as neglect of probability, framing effect, confirmation bias, conservatism (belief revision) and anchoring. Argument Mapper addresses these biases in intelligence analysis by providing an easy-to-use, theoretically sound, web-based interactive software tool that enables the application of evidence-based reasoning to analytic questions. Designed in collaboration with analytic methodologists, this tool combines structured argument mapping methodology with visualization techniques to help analysts make sense of complex problems and overcome cognitive biases. The tool uses Baconian probability and conjunctive logic to automatically calculate the inferential force on the upper level hypothesis. Evaluations with 16 analysts showed the tool was easy to use and easy to understand.

Translating Visually the Reasoning of a Perceptron: The Weighted Rainbow Boxes Technique and an Application in Antibiotherapy
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
In this paper, we propose a technique for translating visually the reasoning of a perceptron. The artificial neuron, or perceptron, is a simplified model of a biological neuron. It can achieve simple reasoning and solve linearly separable problems. Despite its limited reasoning power, it is enough to deal with several real-life problems. The proposed technique is based on rainbow boxes, a technique for overlapping set visualization, which has been applied to the input vectors of the perceptron. We extended this technique, leading to weighted rainbow boxes. It can visualize several input vectors and output values for a single perceptron. We applied this approach to decision support in antibiotherapy, for the determination of the most appropriate antibiotic in urinary infections, by taking into account the properties of each drug (e.g. efficacy, risk of adverse effects, etc). Finally, a user study with 11 physicians showed that most of them found the visualization interesting and easy to read.

Fluid dynamics simulation is often repeated while changing conditions, and therefore we need to compare a large amount of results. In order to compare results under different conditions, it is effective to overlap the streamlines generated from each condition in a single 3D space.

This paper presents a technique to automatically select and visualize important streamlines suitable for comparison of the simulation results. In addition, we present an implementation to observe the flow fields in virtual reality spaces.

Visual Tool for Extracting Anomalous Approaches of Moving Objects
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation

The analysis of incidents is important for preventing collisions between moving objects. However, it requires that many cases of incidents be collected as target data. The purpose of this study was to develop a method that supports the collection of many cases of anomalous (near-miss) approach from massive movement data. To achieve this, a relative superposition method is proposed. Relative superposition is a type of visualization method, in which the trajectories of pairs of moving objects are transformed, focusing on their relative positional relationships. The method is expected to facilitate the search for anomalous approach cases. This paper describes five types of relative superposition, together with a visual tool in which they are implemented. Moreover, it presents a case study in which anomalous approach cases of ships were searched by applying the tool to actual the automatic identification system (AIS) data.

Visual Analytics has brought forward many solutions to different tasks such as exploring topics, understanding user and customer behavior, comparing genomes, or detecting anomalies. Many of these solutions, if not most, are standalone applications with technological contributions which cannot be easily taken for: reuse in other domains, further improvement, benchmarking, or integration and deployment alongside other solutions. The latter can prove specially helpful for exploratory data analysis. This often leads researchers to re-implement solutions and thus to a suboptimal use of skills and resources. This paper discusses further the lack of off-the-shelf libraries for Visual Analytics, and proposes the creation of pluggable libraries on top of existing technologies such as Spark and Zeppelin. We provide an illustrative example of a pluggable, Visual Analytics library using these technologies.

Sketch-Based Interactions for Untangling of Force-Directed Graphs

The exploration of moderately dense networks is used in various challenges of visual data analysis. Frequently, the solutions lay in graph drawing, based on automatic force-directed layout, which results in a spontaneous and irreproducible node-link diagram. Currently available approaches to improve its readability are generally oriented to finite rendering without providing to the analyst handy tools for post-layout manipulations. Enabling indirect manual control on visualizations through multi-step menus may appear difficult to learn and use. Thus, this problem requires a more intuitive way of solving. This paper presents an original toolset for user-guided refinement of the force-directed graph layout, with a bias on pen-centric sketching techniques.

AA-Maps &amp;#x2014; Attenuation and Accumulation Maps for Spatio-temporal Event Visualisation
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
Some phenomena, such as crimes in a city, fires occurred in a country and road accidents can be interpreted as sets of spatio-temporal events. A spatio-temporal event is described by a geographic location, a time instant and other characterising attributes. The cartographic visualisation of spatio-temporal events remains unresolved, due to the challenges related with portraying multiple dimensions simultaneously: the spatial, the temporal and the semantic (zero or more dimensions) phenomenon's components. In this context, this article presents the Attenuation and Accumulation Maps (AA-Maps). The main idea of this visualisation analytic approach consists in showing in a map, the resulting effect of combining attenuation and accumulation, from a temporal reference of observation, given a spatio-temporal Level of Detail (LoD). Imagine the footprints of people crossing a garden in various directions. They leave different traces that summarize the cumulative effect of the footprints on the grass, which is attenuated as time goes by. AA-Maps support different combinations of attenuation and accumulation functions. In addition, this method also enables analysis with different Levels of Detail (LoD), both spatial and temporal. This allows distinct analytic perspectives of the phenomenon while promoting the search for the most suitable parametrization for its characteristics.

The visualization of numeric data is becoming an important element in journalism, and new tools and platforms make the development of data visualization in the news discourse accelerate. In this paper we present an interview study investigating this development in Scandinavian newsrooms. Editorial leaders, data journalists, graphic designers, and developers in 10 major news organizations in Norway, Sweden and Denmark inform the study on a range of issues concerning visual practices and experiences in the newsrooms. Elements of tension are revealed on issues concerning the role and effect of complex, exploratory data visualizations and concerning the role of ordinary journalists in the production of simpler charts and graphs. The results presented are the first outcome of a larger ongoing study investigating visual practices in six European countries.

Designers tend to have repetitive design strategy in the process without notices. The elements setting the interactive function is to conform the user requirement and it can improve the user experiences. Although it has many information recorded on the paper, but via the think-aloud we can find out many implicit information. Then, we can go through the sketch to understand how we define the visualize graphic nodes and find out their implicit mode. By surfacing such behaviors, designers can focus on effective design strategies rather than repetitive design.

This paper presents a method and case study to visualize the urban stock of materials and its availability for use in building future cities. Re-using material from existing buildings for new buildings can be seen as a source for construction materials in times of depleting natural resources. The authors explain the concept of "urban mining" and the challenges, such as "How much resources are available in a city? Today? In the near future?" We explore what data are needed to answer the questions, and then discuss how to best visualize the data in an effective and intuitive way. We apply the concept to an exemplary real-world district in Singapore that is in transformation. Then, we discuss features of a visual tool prototype and explain the thinking behind the design, e.g., how the spatial and temporal dimensions can be presented. Lastly, we conclude the paper with an outlook of future challenges. The paper presents a multi-disciplinary approach with researchers from computer science, architecture, graphic design and material science, and contributes to the discussion of how to visualize knowledge and plan sustainable future cities.

Urban Fusion: Visualizing Urban Data Fused with Social Feeds via a Game Engine
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
This paper presents a framework which allows urban planners to navigate and interact with large datasets fused with social feeds in real-time, enhanced by a virtual reality (VR) capability, which further promotes the knowledge discovery process and allows to interact with urban data in natural yet immersive way. A challenge in urban planning is making decisions based on datasets which are many times ambiguous, together with effective use of newly available yet unstructured sources of information like social media. Providing expert users with novel ways of representing knowledge can be beneficial for decision making. Game engines have evolved into capable testbeds for novel visualization and interaction techniques. We therefore explore the possibility of using a modern game engine as a platform for knowledge representation in urban planning and how it can be used to model ambiguity. We also investigate how urban planners can benefit from immersion when it comes to data exploration and knowledge discovery. We apply the concept of using primitives to publicly available transportation datasets and social feeds of New York city, we discuss a gesture-based VR extension of our framework and lastly, we conclude the paper with feedback from expert users in urban planning and with an outlook of future challenges.

Architecture Proposal for Data Extraction of Chart Images Using Convolutional Neural Network
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
Different information visualization techniques can be found in the literature due to the quantity and variety of data stored in computational systems. In this context, the classification of chart images becomes important because it allows various types of graphs to be detected automatically in different contexts, allowing a more specific processing for each type of visualization, for example, data extraction. Several techniques of image classification can be used, where the most common are based on the extraction of features of the images, and a later classification using these features. However, one technique that has been gaining prominence in the context of image classification is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This technique is based on deep learning and, in a way, encapsulates the feature extraction process. In this way, the proposal of this article is to use an architecture of a client-server based model to do the chart image classification and later data extraction from this image. The main advantage is doing the CNN processing on the server side, so the application does not rely on client device limitations. For this, an image dataset was generated from the web, and it has ten classes of graphs. From the experiments done, it was seen that the use of this technique was feasible, and modifications in the architecture can be made as a proposal to improve the accuracy of the model.

InfluViz &amp;#x2014; A Visualization Tool for Exploring and Analyzing Creative Influence Between Artists and their Works
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
This paper describes the design and development of an interactive tool for explorative visualization of influence networks between artists. Developed in an interdisciplinary collaboration of computer scientists and art historians, the tool aims at supporting art historians and other interested parties in the interactive discovery and analysis of creative influences between a group of artists and their works. The influences are based on the judgements of art historians for pairs of works and an aggregation formula. The tool consists of multiple visualizations, each representing a different level of detail. In addition to metadata, e.g. the date of a work of art, and images of the works of art, influences between works or (if aggregated) between artists are displayed in graph form. A preliminary evaluation of the prototype with a non-expert audience as well as domain experts points to opportunities and areas of potential improvement in applying this approach to support novel research and exploration practices in digital art history.

Participant's emotional factors for a fully online course were measured twice during course using some metrics which were used for a blended learning course. Self efficacy and reflection during learning courses with instruction of note-taking skills were analysed. The contribution of courses and survey points were not significant for gathered responses from participants except "learning hours". These responses of participant's reflection were affected by their characteristics and self efficacy. The relationships across survey metrics were compared across two courses using a causal analysis technique. Also, changes of metrics during the course positively affected to participant's reflections.

2017
Practical education about information security is needed for system developers and administrators in Web service suppliers. We propose a hacking contest CTF as attack and defense style with a website for a multiple online game. The contest organizer prepares a game server site as a contest environment which contains several vulnerability. The contest participants are divided into an attacker team as game players and a defender team as game Website operators. While the attackers access the game site with normal actions, they find vulnerabilities and try cheating actions. While the defenders monitor server logs, they detect illegal events and prevent them for maintenance. An action of each side is calculated as a point and makes each score for victory or defeat by the contest rule. The contest organizer reviews the progress situation with all participants. In this paper, we introduce several functions of a trial system and discuss the result of a trial practice.

Visualizing Dynamic Gene Interactions to Reverse Engineer Gene Regulatory Networks Using Topological Data Analysis
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
This research uses visual analytics to better understand genome dynamics, through a novel application of topological data analysis (TDA) to time series gene expression data. TDA is a model-free approach in which relations are obtained directly from the data. We build the dynamics of the system into the topology, then calculate the influence of potential regulatory genes over the expression of other genes. An interactive 3D visualization is provided to aid in the discovery of functional relationships. These capabilities are contained in a new R package. We apply our technique to synthetic data from the DREAM4 gene regulatory network inference challenge and compare our results to both the challenge submissions and those produced by networkBMA, a Bioconductor package designed to work with time series gene expression data. A case study is presented detailing the use of the visual analytics tool.

Music Plagiarism at a Glance: Metrics of Similarity and Visualizations
2017 21st International Conference Information Visualisation
None
2017
The plagiarism is a debated topic in different fields and in particular in music, given the huge amount of money that music is able to generate. Moreover, it is controversial aspect in the law's field given the subjectivity of the judges that have to pronounce on a suspicious case. Automatic detection of music plagiarism is fundamental to overcome these limits by representing an useful support for judges during their pronouncements and an important result to avoid musicians to spend more time in court than on composing and playing music. In this paper we address this issue by defining a new metric to discover pop music similarity and we study whether visualization can assist domain experts in judging suspicious cases. We describe a user study in which subjects performed different tasks on a song collection using different visual representations to investigate which one is best in terms of intuitiveness and accuracy. Results provided us with positive feedback about our choices and some useful suggestions for future directions.

Interactive Principal Component Analysis

2017
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an established and efficient method for finding structure in a multidimensional data set. PCA is based on orthogonal transformations that convert a set of multidimensional values into linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.The main disadvantage to the PCA approach is that the procedure and outcome are often difficult to understand. The connection between input and output can be puzzling, a small change in input can yield a completely different output, and the user may often wonder if the PCA is doing the right thing.We introduce a user interface that makes the procedure and result easier to understand. We have implemented an interactive PCA view in our text visualization tool called Text Variation Explorer. It allows the user to interactively study the result of PCA, and provides a better understanding of the process.We believe that although we are addressing the problem of interactive principal component analysis in the context of text visualization, these ideas should be useful in other contexts as well.

Output devices to view Virtual Reality (VR), like Head Mount Displays, are getting common lately. However, there is no standard input devices to tell computers user's intention in VR yet. According to the naive intuition, using real objects that has similar shapes as in VR is the better way than using controllers like mouses or game controllers to manipulate objects showed in VR. But is it true? To make it clear, we develop an game system like tower defense. Users played the game in two ways, one is using real objects, the other is using mouse to place "Towers". As the result of questionnaire after game plays, "easy to use" factor was lower for the real objects operation mainly because of the technical difficulties like object detection failure. But the "fun to use" factor was still higher for the real objects than the controllers. It show that using real objects has high potential for interaction between users and the VR system.
